reviewText,overall
has lasted me a long time! def will buy again! no problems with it. glad i could get it cheap,5
"Charges the phone super fast, even faster then the factory charger! I have gone through several car chargers so far, but this one is a keeper!",5
This works and operates better than the Apple car charger and cost a lot less. I would buy it again,5
doesn't fit well with all phone covers but the product is good and would probably buy again.  works well with the car.,4
"I bought 2 of these, one for each car. Both fit great and both work great. Use it on the iPhone 4S, iPod touch and tried on the iPad 2 and seemed to work well. I really must say, for the iPhone and iPod, it really seems to charge fast and the charge lasts. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this if you need this. Came quick USPS in envelope and each boxed. Curly stretchable cord and looks just like the photo.",5
Fell apart within a few months of use. I guess it is worth what you pay. Handle this product carefully.,3
"Great charger!  This charger works perfectly and came exactly as described.  Also, it's nice that it's white and matches my iphone!",5
Product was as described on amazon.  Received very quickly.  This item was a better and more secure fit than other products you would find and buy in most stores.,5
"I love the charger and I also love the price of the charger, It works like it should it is a good charger. Thanks",5
Excellent product! I needed this for my car! Fast shipping! Thanks! Fits my iPhone and IPod perfectly. I would prefer black but white is second best.,5
"Another well made product that you can get without great cost because it comes direct from China.  It takes a little bit longer to get it but you get the low low price because you skip about 3 levels of distribution.  The plastic is well molded, the connections are good quality and the contact in the power socket is first rate (contacts in 3 places instead of just 2 like on the cheaper ones).  The phone or iPod connector is also very well made.  This item is well worth the price and wait.",5
This charger works wonderful! I have had no problems out of it and it serves the purpose. I would highly recommend this.,5
Love this charger and would highly recommend it if you are looking for a reliable charger. And it's a great price also!,5
Cant beat the price for a car charger. Its works great! Much cheaper than buying it at cell phone store!,5
"very happy with my purchase, glad I can get items on amazon worth buying for not a lot of money!",5
"5 Stars from me, have had this about 3 months now and I used it everyday without a hitch. And is still holding up now that I let my friends use it! good buy, would recommend!",5
Always losing cords and cables with this one I just leave plugged in and have no worries about losing it. Accepts all of my Apple products that have 30 pin connectors. Good firm fit not loose at all.,4
I love having a car charger and did not want to pay $20+ in the store to get one. This was a great price and it works just perfect,5
it is as they said very nice i like it because it has a red light to tell me its working and u have to push 2 little button to putt ur phone on the charge i like that because ur phone doesnt come off it by its self,5
"THIS WAS A GTREAT ITEM,ARRIVED ON TIME,GREAT PRICE WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,HAPPY HOLIDAYS PLEASE CHECK THIS SITE OUT.HAVE A GREAT DAY",5
It works perfectly with the phone so I never have to worry about my battery be dead and it stays in the glove box,5
Save your money. It either get stuck in the your car's outlet or it doesn't fit right.Just go to Walmart.,1
"Bought this for my dad's iPad 2.  It worked fine in his car for about six-seven weeks, then it died.  I would have bought him another one, but I got a new iPhone 5 (different charger) so I gave him my old iPhone 4S charger.  It's cheap, I'd say it's worth the gamble.",3
"After looking and looking for a charge to work, this has out done its self.  Works great on the Iphone 4",5
"So far it works and fits in car charger perfectly. easy to plug in and pull out. that is all that matters, oh and yeah it works, but I mentioned that already :-)",5
I have purchased this charger in the past it worked for just over two years. This product works well and I would recommend it.,5
Good but the charger is not the same size as an Apple charger and that makes it a little difficult for charging with cases on.,4
Not the best charger but for the price I don't expect it to be.  It charges fine so mission accomplished.,4
"It works very well, and it has not broken like most chargers do. It also charges my phone very quickly.",5
I needed an adapter to use in the car and didn't want to pay the store (cellular) prices. I was weary about this but so far it has lived up to expectations.,4
"Simply put, this car charger is so great for the price.  It is solid and does it's job.  It get's a lot of use and has held up incredibly.  I highly recommend this for a fast charge.",5
"I bought 3 of them, my dads worked well in his truck, my moms worked well in her car, but mine wouldn't charge in my car and i have no idea why... the light comes on, but it wont charge my phone. thought it was a phone problem, but i took the same charger and same phone and plugged it into both of my parents vehicles and it charged just fine! but yet in my car it doesn't even say a thing, its like it was never plugged in. no error message or messages saying its not compatible, just nothing at all... so as long as you don't have a vehicle that for some reason disagrees with it like in my case, it works well.",4
"No problems ever.  Would recommend I used this for an iPhone. Seemed to charge as fast as my brand name charger, so it's worth the $$.",5
"I used this charger for a while and then it stopped working, i had to be moving it around for it to work. #THESTRUGGLE. not worth it :(",1
"I didn't expect this to work well, or even at all. However, I've had it for a year, and it stills work and charges nicely. Get my phone from  20% to 65% in about an hour in my 2001 Civic",5
"Shipping was quick and very easy. Good product for price. Of course, it is not as heavy duty as the original ones, but fine for what you pay.",4
this was worth the money it was cheap but it works very well and compare to a brand name this beats it,5
Charger works great and looks good. Don't go pay a highly inflated retail price for a similar product in a store.,5
This charger only got me about 8% battery in 30 min.  That being said I purchased this more to keep my battery from going down when using Navigation.  It does that fairly well.,4
"Since I have a white iPhone, I wanted a white phone charger for my car. It charges really quick too.",5
"Great Value and price, charges well and fits all cigarett sockets does well in a pinch when you get off work and find that the battery is almost gone you simply plug it in and go about your getting all your clients taken care of and charging at the same time.",5
What can i say.  it is a car charger and it works just like it is supposed to.  i would recommend it.  Good price.,5
This sucks I bought it last year and havnt done review on it yet so here is. Save your money and a better one it stopped working on me. Please don't buy it. P.s. I've NEVAR rated a product so low...EVAR.,1
Love it....needed one for each car so we don't have to move from one car to another.  Works as it's supposed it.,4
This charger works!This is the 2nd one purchased from Amazon. The first one lasted only 6 months and died. I'm hoping for longer service with the one from Cbus,4
"Have not gotten a single scratch on the phone, and I like the classy look of it. Even if it falls, the phone stays locked into place. Very happy with it.",5
it came very quickly and my mother lovess this one too i can't wait to recieve mine soon. very satified!,5
"not really a snug fit.  it works for a small time, but if u take it off and put it back on multiple time it wont work.",3
Nice fits fine.  The case feel good in your hand but it does want to slide off the sides. Could be a little stiffer.,3
Great price & product!  Feels great and is bright yellow like I LOVE!!!They sell these same covers in the malls for more than 10bucks!!!I am an AMAZONIAN (shopper)!!!,5
"I originally ordered another orange case, but it turned out to be almost like a 'peach' color.  This is a true orange color, Oregon State Beaver Orange!  I previously had ordered a black Amzer case, which cost $10 shipped, and this one only cost a few bucks shipped.  While I like the Amzer case a bit more b/c it is textured and slightly tighter, this case fits well and is super cheap.  At this price, I can use it, lose it, and order another!  Shipping was decently fast (I bought the Amzer b/c it had amazon 2 day prime shipping and I wanted a case fast) about 8 business days me thinks.The rubber is smooth, with no texture at all.  At first I thought it my be slippery, but it's rubber and grips just fine.  Don't hesitate to buy this case, or any of the colors like it!",5
"There are much better for the same price range. I bought 3 different protectors all from about the same price range and this was the worst of all three. Here is why:1. It does not cover the screen all the way. If started from the speaker at the top it does not cover the 4 soft buttons at the bottom which are part of the screen in my mind.2. The speaker cutout is better than my second choice, but not by much.3. It does not cover the screen from side to side.The only good part about this screen protector is that it comes with 2 protective coverings on each side of the screen protector to keep it from collecting dust and getting scratched during installation.Overall, this is only worth getting if you only care about the actual LCD display being protected. It will leave an 1/8 of an inch on the sides and the whole bottom of the screen exposed where the 4 soft buttons are.The best one that I bought is:'HTC EVO 4G / HTC A9292 / Supersonic Screen Protector' by Luxmo (ASIN B003MAYKSS)It only comes with one, but it fits the full screen perfectly leaving no gaps.",2
"When it arrived I thought it would be too big but it fit perfectly. I'm confident that my phone is protected when its on. Good quality, even better price",5
"Its decent, but hard to put on.  Cuts down on screen brightness a little, but overall a good item and worth the money.",4
The quality is terrible.  Too bright...just really flexible.  This product is garbage and don't buy it...it was a waste of money.,1
"I thought this item would be a pretty unique touch to my new evo; I was wrong. The picture makes the case appear like an electric yellow and in fact it's more of a canary, dull yellow. The case does not fit the phone correctly--in fact it's too big, especially on the sides of the phone. Kind of a buzz kill.",1
"fits fine... price is good, even after including shipping...top power button slightly off but you can still operate the phone easily.",4
"Great screens for the price. They lasted the whole time I had the phone. Only had to try once to put it on, others I've tried took at least two attempts to put on.",5
This case is exactly what I was looking for. Fits perfectly on my phone and I just love the color.,5
"Good product, not problems. I would recommend it to anyone looking to protect their screens and help with maintaining their phone.",5
It came today after I ordered on Sunday! I'm very pleased it fits my new cellphone so perfect. And it's perfect color purple which is my favorite color. I would order from this company again.,5
glad i got them. would get them again. i still hace a couple left. can't wait to order more. !,5
"this is a steal.. very good protectors at a wonderful price, and i received my order on time....must buy this its a great product",5
Now I can envelope my phone in my favorite color case and keep it protected from accidental falls. Thanks a lot!,5
just like any other screen protector this one is great as well... fitted phone perfectly dont waste $$ on expensive ones,4
Case was slightly lose but worked fine. Good grip and protection for the phone. I would purchase another in the future.,4
"put these on my wife's. mine, and my friend's evos.  They are a perfect fit, easy to apply, and haven't peeled up like the $25 mall ones.  It still looks like new.  It's been about 9 months since I put it on.",5
"The image shows a packaged screen protector with cleaning cloth. I received 3 very thin, curved protectors without a cloth. When installed the curve of the thin plastic rises along the edges. They were the corrcet dimensions to cover the entire screen but was very cheap quality. The first one installed had to be discarded due to too much curve causing it to peel up. The second one i heated up a little to get the curve to a minimum and it installed ok. The phone case held the edges down fairly well. All in all i would not recommend this protector. FYI- I do a lot of these for friends and family so I do know what I'm doing.10/25/12 - update. the protector will not stay on the screen at all. It keeps peeling up and bubbling. I have tossed the one i didnt use.",1
"I really don't know where I ordered these from but horrible quality.First of all the screens don't fit. I'm not saying there not for the evo, I mean there to large for the screen.(Barely, but enough to when you put it on, a whole side won't stick )I had to trim off the edges with a razor blade. When I finally got it on, now seriously I'm not exaggerating, I put it in my empty pocket and later pulled it out to find a screen with a bunch of scratches on it. I had already reviewed it and received a call because of bad review. His explanation was a manufacturer defect. Maybe it was or maybe it wasn't but my experience was horrible. Good price though",1
"This is the 2nd Silicone skin I ordered. I wanted different color other than the one I have. The very first one I ordered a couple of months ago, was perfect fit & quality & it was sold by Importer520. The 2nd time it was sold by LowerPriceUSA. It is very made of very stiff material & has a very low quality per following:1 - The pictures showed the back of the Silicone cover has 3 individual openings, one for camera lens, one for flash & one for speaker. The one I received has a one large opening for all three & it does not protect like the 3 separate openings.2 - The headset opening is off & like someone has cut it with a razor very unevenly and it is not round.3 - The edges of the skin is so unevenly cut & again looks like someone cut them by hand with a dull scissor.4 - The color shows as it is red, but the one I received is actually very dark pinkish bright red.Went to the garbage.",1
"Loved the color of this case, easy to find when I set it down.  Like the 'grippiness' of case so I didn't easily drop phone, since I had a slight history of breaking the screen (was on my 3rd screen).  Unfortunately, had to keep a couple of these silicone cases in backstock as they do stretch out, especially since I had to change the battery several times a day on the Evo 4G.  I'm sure that shortened the life of the case.  But I got my money's worth from the case.",4
I got these as a christmas gift for my brother in law and the price was great! Fast ahipping and he loves them! Great purchase!,5
Purchased for my girlfriends phone. Is holding up as well as the expensive store bought cases. Very highly recommended to protect your smartphone from drops.,5
I got this because it's similar to one that I already have.  Unfortunately I cannot use it because it made the screech protector raise up and I had to get a new one.  I just threw the case in the trash.,1
"I received mine in a simple envelope, which is fine (unless the envelope gets bent).  It was very simple to put on, and there were plenty of them to go around.  However, it did have a rainbow in the middle of the screen.I also purchased and compared it against the Seidio Ultimate Screen Protector for HTC EVO 4G, 2 Pack (Crystal Clear), http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OQUKJS/ref=oss_productand also against the SGP STEINHEIL HTC Evo 4G Sprint Screen Protector (Ultra Crystal), http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TML0V4/ref=oss_productThis cheap version clearly made the screen resolution (pixels) look less clear.  Ironic choice of words huh?  Yes, it made the EVO's beautiful screen grainy, as if turning an HD TV back to non-HD, not to mention the rainbow colors it showed on the center of the screen.  How did I know?  I compared it against my wife's EVO which had the other better quality screen.  I quickly removed it and tried the other two brands.  You get what you pay for.  I guess it's better than no screen cover huh?Between the Seidio and Steinheil screen protectors, I'd say they are about on par, except the Steinheil Ultra Crystal had a brighter effect (it prevented less light from the EVO from reaching your eye balls), and the feel against it had less friction than the Seidio.  If I had to choose, I'd definitely go with the Steinheil.",3
"Great fit, great look, great great great. Covers edge of screen cover well, holes are aligned perfectly, and it bounces well :) Highly recommend if you like green.",5
"I like this case because it fits well.  it fits tight and it is not easy to take it off.  That is a plus for me.  it protects my iPhone from bumps and scratches and it looks good.  I use mine as an extra case when I have a smaller purse.  In all, this is a very good case especially considering that Apple 'gave' it to me (Actually giving it is a way of expressing because I paid for my iPhone and two years of service with AT&T; :))The con: It is a little hard to take off.",4
"I also received this case free from the Apple program. I would not pay full price for this. The main reason being the feel. It is HARD. Really hard. Come on guys...provide some comfort, any comfort. But no, they made this case very hard and along with skimpy comfort it also reduces grip security because it is so hard (better than an iphone 4 without a case but no where near the grip from the case I linked to below). This case that sells for a few dollars with shippingPremium Soft Silicone Gel Skin for Apple iPhone4, 4th Generation, 4th Gen, Blackis vastly superior. The Speck case is Really a disapointment.But now for the good points. It is fitted extremely well. It does not add much bulk at all to the iphone and the cutouts are prefect. I also think it looks good, although it does attract lint, food particles (hey what can I say I use the iphone during meals sometimes), etc. between the 'pixels.'They obviously went for fit and lack of bulk and if this is what you are looking for it might be a fine to very good case for you. I wanted something that made the phone feel good in my hand and secure in my hand as well. The one cent case does a better job overall as a case. In fact I am going to stick to that one. I am frankly bemused at how they could put out such a comfort unfriendly case, unless their market niche is hard, slim cases and forget about comfort and to some extent grip. If so they did a great job.One additional comment, you do, to some extent, get use to the hardness of the case, but it still is miles away from the comfort of the 'one cent' case. I was ready to throw it in the trash at first, but decided to give it a try and my hand is getting use to the hardness a bit. But still...why? They must have some freakishly strong hand strength people in their testing department not to have noticed this prior to relasing it. If you REALLY need a slim case, though, that might be a trade off you are willing to make and the only reason I could see going for this one.Overall, keep looking and I would suggest you not choose this as your free iphone case if you still have the chance when you read this.Update 9/12. Threw it in the trash. Makes the iphone way too uncomfortable in your hand. Not sure what they were thinking making this. Very disappointed to say the least I did not choose a different iphone free case option. Not even worth free.",1
I like the case material but it is too stiff and the cutout for attaching a charging cable is too constrictive so I can only charge it using the cable provided by Apple. None of the others work. Very annoying.  I really think that manufacturers ought to let real users try things before they start to sell them.  They would have realized the problems with the design almost immediately.,2
"Simple and subtle. This is not the coolest case every made. This is not the prettiest case ever made. But this case works. It adds very little bulk to the phone. The rubber feels pretty good in my hand. The back with those 'HD Pixels' gives my hand a little better grip on the phone. I also like the raised edge on the front, if you place the iPhone on a flat surface, it will protect the screen from getting scratched. I like how the volume buttons and the big top standby button are completely covered in rubber. The silence switch and iPod connector ares exposed and easy to get at. The camera lens is afforded a bit more protection since it is now recessed the thickness of the rubber case.This case arrived as part of the antennagate free case from Apple. If I was buying a case I would have never selected this one. Now that I have it, the case is pretty nice. After using it, I'd buy it again.Now on the name PixelSkin HD? No that is just plain stupid. There is nothing HD or High Definition about this skin. In fact, it is really low definition from the feel of the rubber. PixelSkin? Those are silly little raised squares on the back, not pixels. It is a dumb name for a phone case.I haven't tried the phone in a dock with this case in place. It really won't be a problem, the case slips off and on very easily.Oh, and yes it does solve the antenna issue.",4
No question when it comes to speck.  I just order another cover for my iphone 5 just great cover.  I have faith in speck like always never fail.  My daughter usually from my phone from table height to my hardwood floor.  My phone is safe like hundred times before,5
"I do not like this case.  It might be your cup of tea, but I think it's of poor design and execution.  The case is is meant to be super thin and maintain the lines of the phone.  However, in doing this it also fails to be much of a protective case. I've been using this case for about a week and in that time the bottom of the case under the home button has become looser and more fatigued.  Probably a combination of being touched a lot and being one of the thinner pieces on the case.  It's counter part at the top of the phone is much taught.  It can be annoying and the piece will actually slide down off the body of the phone at times.  As well, the case is pretty slick in my opinion, the pix-elated effect on the back allows it to slip of your pocket easily, but also your hand.  The rubberized texture on the sides that are suppose to compensate do not and I can't imagine using this with gloves or something.  Fortunately, this was my free case from Apple and I can see why they got a good deal on them, if I could return it, I totally would.  Save your money, look for something else.",2
"Speck produces two cases which go by the name PixelSkin HD Case for iPhone 4.  One is a hard plastic model, which is extremely inflexible.  Turning the unit on/off is nearly impossible.  Putting on the case/taking it off is very difficult.  Basically this case sucks.  If you get this case from Speck - contact their customer service and after they check the serial number on the unit they will send you the good one.The good PixelSkin HD Case for iPhone 4 is really, really good.  The material is great, it feels great, looks great, and is very protective of the iPhone.  It is an excellent case.  I use it everyday.  Highly recommended, I give it five stars.I am giving this case one star, as you don't know what you are going to get.  If you are willing to take your chances, then buy the case.... and good luck.",1
After I have read all reviews I was very concern about 'old' and ' new' versions of this case. When I received my case I was pleasantly surprise to get a new version which is more flexible than old one and has bigger hole for camera&flash.;Case it self is very comfortable and Does not leave fingerprints.Great case for very Low price!,5
This was for my boyfriend's phone. It showed up fast and looks very good. He likes it alot-very sturdy...he drops his phone all the time!,5
"I have bought 3 different Amzer covers for my Nexus, they ALL tinted the entire phone, this one will leave the back of yourphone red..and it wont come off! I also tried it on tmy new Evo and the same thing, they are cheaply built and dont get them! you will be sorry!",1
"This was a very good looking case. Unfortunately, it was difficult to close and, eventually,the top frame broke when removing it. I would not recommend it.",2
"This case functions acceptably.  By no means is it a quality case, but for the price, it will do the job.This case, at least the one I received which looks just like the picutre, is NOT RUBBERIZED.  It is plastic.In fact, this case is simply 2 plastic pieces that snap together.  It seems to be made of the same painted plactic that the old snap-together models I used to build as kid are.  Oh yeah, in case you didnt notice what I said there, it is PAINTED PLASTIC, it can scratch off.If you are not expecting something to provide a lot of protection, and are just looking for something to dress up your phone, this will be great.  If you are expecting quality materials and some realistic protection, keep shopping.I was disapointed when I opeend the package and saw the cheap painted snap-together plastic case.  I was actaully impressed after I installed it in that it really does look nice once installed.  I am looking for a new case that will provide better protection for my phone, but in the interim this case was a good deal for the price.I have not have any issues with staining as the reivewer stated.",3
the product is good for a day but after having to remove the battery a few times it doesnt snap any more.,2
"I bought this case to protect my Motorola Droid X.  I've been using it for a couple months now, and it has met my expectations.  I like the feel of it, and it molds to the Droid X perfectly.  The microphone/speaker/camera slots line up.  It is a little difficult to push the power/volume/camera buttons, the camera button in particular is difficult. However, it does not make the device unusable.  Another thing to note is that depending on the type of device you plug into the headphone jack, you may need to remove the case.  For example, I have a cable to connect audio to my car radio system.  The cable will not fit snugly into the headphone jack when the case is on.  I have to take the case off for it to work.  However, my Apple headphones work fine with it.All in all, I recommend this case for the Motorola Droid X.",5
"I am generally not one to use phone covers since they add unnecessary weight and bulk to wonderfully designed and aesthetically pleasing devices.Seriously, have you seen these urbanites with their 'Otter Box' level protection easily adding 3x-4x the thickness and weight?? ...not to mention yielding costs above overnight insurance replacement.  Are people planning on hanging their obsolete, yet completely mint looking devices on their walls when they eventually get something new?  Such a shame to waste all that hard work by engineers... seems we are nearing lead encased, nuclear protected, bulletproof, 'mobile' phone boxes requiring wheels and a handle.  Maybe they will come out with actual bag phones that can safely be hung on your shoulder, or phones the size of a brick offering more grip and 'case protection' ... oh wait!However, basically being a brick in itself, I was initially a bit worried about the X's large screen and decided to try the slimmest/lightest protection route I could find.  Still, in the end, I don't use anything except for an X specific screen protector and remain extremely pleased.10 days with heavy user, meaning occasional device drops in variable environments and a lot of holding in hand with corresponding finger movements. (1 Exchange Account, 8 IMAP Emails, 4000 txt per month, Drop box with full sync of corporate documents - edited daily with Quickoffice, 20+ GB of music and video loaded, light gaming, etc)Pros:- Case is built well, light, and decently thin compared to others.- I bought it upon a recommendation of a friend who uses the same material on his Incredible. I have seen way too many torn/worn (i.e. fugly) silicon sleeves and this poly appears very durable in comparison.- Fits well & snug- Adds 'non-slip' if you are into that sort of thing- Can place phone face down and the lip will protect the screen (Yet so does a screen protector)- Theoretically helps protect in a fall, yet my X has since (removal) hit many hard surfaces from 4-5 feet with not so much as a scratch anywhere.- Unique visual design- Great price!Cons:- As others mentioned, the buttons are not as easy to use with the case.  I was still able to use them all (with extra effort) so never ended cutting them out.- I found the lip around the screen annoying for full motion finger movements- This or any case will theoretically require the antenna to work harder = more battery consumption- Still adds noticeable weight & thickness",4
"I came to this case after using a massive Kraken protective case for the last year, which essentially made my Droid X the size of a compact car.  Love the grip, the look and the sheer ease of use of this case.  I forgot how sleek and sharp my Droid X can look in the proper case.  If you're looking to make your X the highlight (and not the case it's in), this is a great choice.  The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because it doesn't exactly offer enormous protection in the case of a drop.  I highly recommend the case, nonetheless.",4
"Well, I no longer have this phone or case, because have upgraded to the note 2, but this case protected the phone very well and it did it's job.",5
Well i am pleased by this case. its enough to protect the phone for tear and wear and maybe some minor falls. I hear folks having problems with the headphone wholes and such but all ports on my phone were accesible without any modification. And it gives the phone a little bit of a cool look. Anyways its worth the money for those that want something simple to protect your phone.,4
I think this maybe the best case I have ever purchased for a smartphone. I have had many various smartphones and this case fits like a glove. It's not bulky. Easy to put on and easy off. There is only 1 negative. The case covers the camera side button as well as the volume button. Most likely for protection. I'm goin to take a razor blade and cut those spaces open. Other than that I love it. I would recommend to anyone who wants to show off there phone and wants protection without the bulkyness. Smooth feel with good grib as well. Also if you are looking for a side clip this case is not for you.,4
"Pros:1. Great material. Not sticky like silicone. Probably a little less crash protection compared to silicone too due to lower compression, but no complaints.2. Extremely good fit. Fits better than a glove.3. Nice color. Not too flashy. Can see the logo from the back.Cons:1. Fits so well that you can't use this if you go for the extended battery cover. But I like the case so much, I'm giving the extended battery a miss.2. Buttons are largely unusable. You need to use your nails to push the button protrusions on the case far enough to make contact with the device buttons. Definitely a design flaw that could've been easily fixed with nubs under the button protrusions (Amzer's argyle cases for the Evo have such nubs). I'm getting around this by using a lock widget to lock, the home button to unlock and my bluetooth device controls for volume.3. Holes for the ports are cut so small that many of my generic micro-USB cables don't fit.4. Case causes the phone speaker (in the back) to be almost completely inaudible when placed on its back. This issue exists even without the case, but is made worse by the rubbery case material and the exactingly-cut speaker hole.Love it despite the significant cons.",4
"Just bought 2 cases from Amazon one being the Amzer Luxe Argyle skin case and the other a Seidio Innocase Active (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041D81W6/ref=oss_product) both for the DroidX.  After much back and forth I am heavily leaning towards keeping the Amzer over the Seidio. For starters it fits like a glove there is no play in the case once its on the phone (which by the way is very easy to take on and off).  It also has a great feel to it and I find that I'm able to rest the DroidX evenly on my 4 fingers leaving my thumb for typing, etc.  Basically when I have it resting on my fingers unlike some cases specifically the Seidio it does not feel like its going to slide out of your hand because of the skin material. It also allows the entire screen to be open and when your swyping down the notification bar at the top of the screen, your fingers are not hitting any material.  This was one of the problems I'm finding with the Seidio Innocase Active which has a little piece of rubber that tends to get in the way everytime.  The Seidio case also doesn't lay as nicely in my hand and I feel I have to have a grip on the phone or use my pinky finger as a stabilizer on the bottom to keep it from falling out of my hand while typing.  The one plus with the Seidio case is that it does have a hard protective shell that keeps the corners and side of the phone protected.  I'm not sure how well the Amzer would help other than keeping the phone from being scuffed up.The Amzer is a very nice looking case although I was unsure about the weave pattern at first it really doesn't look that bad.  I probably would prefer an all black case but for $9.99 vs the $24.99 Seidio charges I think you would be hard pressed to find a better case than the Amzer.  I would definitely recommend it.Hopefully it holds up over time.",5
"I bought my Droid X a few weeks back and bought the Platinum case from Best Buy made by Seidio.  The clip for the case was wonderful and comfortable but the case was bulky and got in the way of the functions of the phone, plus it broke after taking it off 10 times.  I got the Luxe Argyle case by Amzer because of its price but I have to say it is a great case much better than the $40.00 case from Best Buy.  And an added bonus is that the additional thickness makes the case fit in the clip perfectly.  I love this case and would happily buy at 4 times the price.  Best phone case I have ever found.",5
This case fits the droid perfectly and is very firm around the edges so you don't have to worry about it popping off. It also adds some style to your droid. The side buttons are covered by the case and can be kind of hard to press but after a couple weeks it seems like it has worn in a little bit and is somewhat easier to press.,4
"There is nothing that I can add to this review that is not already known by anyone that owns or is thinking about owning a Galaxy S phone or Vibrant specifically.  The one thing I can comment on it the fact that T-Mobile and Samsung has released the Android 2.2 OS over mini Kies.  This has turn this phone into a monster that rivals everything else on the market.  This cures all the aforementioned woes of all the other reviews before mine. Here are a few features added.Voice commands mainly the Voice to Text featureWireless AP turns the phone into a wireless HotspotFlash 10.1 for superb web browsing.Wi-Fi callingGPS photo tagging (location added to the date and time stamp)These are a few features added that I can think of off the top of my head. The one gripe I have is the battery life.  So rather than complain I found a replacement.  Seek out a 3500maH batter and your woes are over. T-mobile and Samsung have renewed my faith in their ability to deliver a phone that goes toe to toe with the best phones on the market, in my opinion win.",5
"This is now Tmobile's premier phone.  Since Tmobile doesn't have the Iphone, the Droid or even 4G, this is their best.  It's okay and definitely better than the My Touch but it's no Iphone.There is no camera in the front and not even a flash--how cheap can you get Samsung?  Samsung always makes boneheaded mistakes on phones by trying to make them 'unique,' and this phone is no different.  There is no notification light to let you know you've a text or voicemail. Go in the shower and come out, if you got a call the only way you will know is by turning on the phone.  The notification light hardly uses any battery and this is simply a really stupid mistake by Samsung.Also, the charger is on the top.  It is the only phone I know with the charger on the top so if you're trying to make a call while charging it's very awkward to say the least.So for the same price as the Iphone 4 and the Droid X, you get a phone that has only 5MP with no flash, no camera in the front, so-so battery life, a paltry 2MB memory card, and no notificaton lights for calls.  Frankly, the only reason to get it is because you've Tmobile, which does have great customer service and good prices--but can Tmobile at least join the 21st century and get a real phone to give its customers something that doesn't seem like yesterday's news?",3
"Since i have been using Windows Mobile devices for years i was reluctant to buy a phone with a different OS but now that i have seen just how wonderful Android is i am very happy that i made the switch.First of all the Samsung Vibrant is one of the most powerful phones on the market today,it has a 1Ghz Hummingbird processor,512MB of Ram and enough graphics processing power to let you play a game like Quake 3 with ease.You really need to use the phone yourself to see how beautiful games and movies look on the Vibrants display,the videos on Youtube don't do it justice.The one thing i did not look forward to was using a touchscreen to type since i was used to a physical qwerty keypad but after about an hour using the on screen keys it became second nature to use.As for navigating through the menus all you do is give a gentle swipe with your finger or thumb and that's it,simple,no problems with response time,no annoying slowdown,hands down the most hassle free way to navigate a mobile device.As for the sound and call quality everything is clear,both the front and rear speaker do their job well,i just wish the rear speaker was a little louder,but this is a minor complaint.While using the Vibrant to make calls i found that the signal was strong,people i talked to said they could hear me fine and they also came in loud and clear.If you're in a 3G area you will find web pages load in seconds but if you're not you would be better served by using the WiFi feature,the only downside of this is that WiFi drains the battery fast so only use it when you have to.Speaking of the battery it lasts quite a long time even when using 3G data,playing games or watching movies for hours on end.I have only used the gps navigation service twice so far but i can say it is very accurate,i got to my destination with no problems whatsoever.There is a camera on the back of the Vibrant that takes photos and records videos which look very nice even when displayed on an HDTV.The one major issue i worried about coming from a Windows Mobile device was losing all those apps i have become so fond of such as Coreplayer,my fear was unfounded for the most part,even though Coreplayer isn't out for Android yet.Documents To Go,Slick Messenger,Skype and tons of other great apps are available now and work just as well (if not better) on the Android OS.If you like to use your device as a music player and load it up with Mp3's you will fall in love with this thing,not only does it have a standard 3.5mm headphone jack but it also has 16GB of internal storage,of course a lot of this storage is used for other things but no worries,you can pop in a 16GB or 32GB Micro SD card and you're set.I have not even talked about the other outstanding feature of the Vibrant,it has video/audio out via the 3.5mm jack!You can buy some cheap cables right here on Amazon and have your phones HD display on your tv,this is a feature that should be standard on all future smartphones.I could go on and on about how this thing will change your life but all that's left to say is give it a try and i bet you will love it.Enjoy :)Update: 2-17-2011After having this phone for a few months i have decided to return it.After getting the Android 2.2 Froyo update the phones battery life was cut in half and many apps now force close at least once a day,this phone really can't handle Froyo well but that's only one of the problems i have run into.The fact that it has no front facing camera makes it impossible to do video chat over WiFi without constantly turning phone around so other person can see me,the back of the device gets very hot at times especially when playing 3D games,the GPS works great at times and then says you're over a mile from where you really are!I know for a fact that this is not due to weak signal since the person with me used another phone on same network with the same app and had no Gps problems.Bottom line is that the Vibrants hardware flaws keep it from being the device it could have been.I still like the Android OS,Froyo is very slick but you will be better served using it on another device.",5
"This phone is OK, I took it back.  The screen is great.  The performance is OK.  The Samsung software is kinda sucky.  I went back to my Nexus One.",3
"The screen....the speed...the Swype! This is one killer...way too much to just call it a phone. Brilliant is the word, T-Mobile's best handset yet. I gave up waiting for Windows Phone 7. This will do me fine. Really, the Swype on this is the absolute easiest to use of any phone I have tried it on. This thing is glorious.",5
"This is the first phone of this kind I've ever owned. My previous phone was a simple Nokia that was mostly made to play music in addition to calls. It didn't have a touch-screen, and texting was a pain. Now that I've had my grubby paws on this one for a couple days I find myself wondering how I ever made do with anything less.This phone is a beauty to behold. The screen simply pops with color and life! Everything is easy to organize and to access, and the screen is almost completely customizable (I still can't figure out how to remove the Google search bar at the top of the main screen). This customization is quite handy since you'll likely end up with tons of apps from the Android store.The touch screen is nice and sensitive, with a jolly little vibration every time you touch something. This is quite nice and removes any questions about whether or not you've actually pressed a particular button.The call quality on this phone is quite excellent; much better than what I'm used to. I live in the north end of downtown Phoenix and especially over the last few weeks I've had lots of calls drop with my old phone. With this new one, I haven't had any dropped calls yet.You also get all the usual functions like you'd expect, such as a decent camera (no flash, though), a voice recorder, speakerphone functionality, email support, etc.For the more entertainment-minded people out there you'll be happy to know that in addition all the fun Android apps that can be downloaded, there's also a YouTube app that's installed (and works quite well), a copy of the T-Mobile version of 'Sims 3' and a copy of the movie 'Avatar'. You can even download and run Google Earth on it, which is quite fun!Now one minor problem I will report with it is this: I've had more than a couple times where some app I was running froze and caused the phone to crash. I'm assuming this is just some software error that will be fixed with a later update. It's annoying right now, but not badly so.I'd also recommend that you get a cover or gel skin for the phone since it's not textured and could easily slip out of your grasp if you aren't careful.If you're looking for a good phone, this is a good one to get, especially if you can get a deal from T-Mobile. Aside from the minor crash issues, I'm very pleased with it so far.",5
"I picked up the phone 4 days ago.  I upgraded from the Motorola Cliq (and G1 before that).  This is by far the best of the Androids.  My biggest fear was going from slide keyboard to all touch screen.  I took the quick swype tutorual.....(now I'm saying, 'what keyboard?').  I don't miss it at all!  The phone is fast and I love the video/movie clarity.  The sound is great (with headphones).I have however had a few problems.  The headphones are not good at all for talking.  I've tried using them about 5 times and every time, the person on the other end complained that they couldn't hear me (the speaker phone works great though).  Also, all of my 300+ contacts copied over from Google when I logged in; however, I can't save any into groups nor can I assign ring tones (the work around T-Mobile gave didn't work).  Also, I somehow erased Avatar from my SD card.  The process is to have Samsung send a new one.Overall, there is far more good to this phone than bad.  If you're on the fence; buy it!Samsung Vibrant Android Phone (T-Mobile)",4
"T-mobile, the first carrier to even have an android phone (the G1), blew its lead with the OS on a stream of mediocre handsets.  While the other carriers got newer and better devices, T-mobile lagged behind, until now.  Finally, at long last, a quality handset has arrived: the Vibrant.  With its good looks, blazing fast speed, and quality OS, T-mobile customers can finally upgrade to a great phone.*Hardware*The Good:-The first thing you notice about the Vibrant is its big beautiful screen.  The 480x800 AMOLED screen is sharp and beautiful, easy to type on, and shows plenty of detail.-The phone itself is thin and light, with a nice curve near the bottom to hold onto.-1 GHz Samsung Hummingbird processor is faster in benchmarks than a 1 GHz Snapdragon and offers enhanced graphics procesing-The buttons are not buttons but touch sensitive surfaces, like a flat screen TV.-16gb of onboard storage is awesome.  Add a 32gb microsdhc card and you've got 48gb, more than the iPhone.-3G connection takes advantage of T-mobile's ever expanding 3G network, currently the fastest of any carrier in many cities.-5 megapixel camera takes decent pictures and records video at 720p.The Bad:-The big compromise here is the camera.  While the EVO and Incredible have 8MP cameras, the Vibrant has only 5MP.  Flash and Front Facing Camera are glaring omissions from this otherwise high end phone.-The plastic feels a bit cheap, but this is the case with most phones these days.-Garish T-mobile and Samsung logos detract from the smooth appearance.*Software*The Good:-Android 2.1 is stock on the phone with a promised upgrade to 2.2 in the near future.  The latest versions of android are fast, more battery efficient, and have fewer 'force close' errors.  Some highlights include animated wallpapers, 7 home screens, and support for flash in web browsing.-The interface is fast and smooth.-Samsung has managed not to screw up the interface to this phone like it did on the Behold 2.  The customizations are useful and unobtrusive.*Included Accessories*The Good:-2 backplates (shiny blue or shiny purple) for customization.-Nice gelly earphones are higher quality than most phones.-Charger is a solid usb/wall combo.-Avatar movie shows off the phone's beautiful screen.-Free Sims 3 game is a fun way to kill some time.The Bad:-2gb MicroSD card is a bit lame compared to the 16gb internal memory, but easily upgradable.Overall this is a great phone.  Some hardware compromises prevent it from being the best Android phone ever, but it is still the best Android phone for T-mobile, and is the phone many customers, including myself, have been waiting for.  The phone looks great, is blazingly fast, and has plenty of bells and whistles.",5
"Seriously, you can carry this in your shirt pocket and not feel it.It weigh's in at just under 118 grams. (Comparatively, the iPhone weighs 135 grams and is thicker.)It's powerful and even better with Froyo. The downside is Touch Wiz, Samsung's UI really slows this phone down and the bloatware is just crap, frankly.I'd go on about the awesome super AMOLED screen but just read all the other reviews about it. Killer!I had the first Android phone, the G1 and this phone is night and day better. Highly recommend it.",4
"Had mine for about 2 weeks before selling it.Pro:1.  Screen.  Watch Avatar on that is a treat for your eyes.  Screen real estate is great too.  Also, screen is really tough to scratch.2.  Dolby sound.  pretty impressive for such a slim device.3.  Size and shape.  Feels so much thiner than iphone 3Gs.  I also love the odd bump on the back.  I feel it provides character.4.  free extra back bezel is cool.  Love the purple backing.  And I am a dude.5.  Superior headphone quality and sound.6.  16gb bult-in memory.  2gb reserved for system and apps.  Still, more than enough for my use.7.  Amazing HD camcorder and camera under good light.Con:1.  SAMOLED screen also burns battery.  I have to charge it nightly.  Can not compare with iphone 3Gs.2.  Skype does not work, period.  I need it for international calls.3.  Bluetooth headset issue.  It will pair and work fine.  But after a few auto lock screens, it can no longer find my BT headset.  Blue-Ant Z9.  Never had an issue with iphone 3Gs.4.  Where is my 2.2 update?5.  GPS lock issue when 'Assisted via data' is turned off.  What's up, Samsung?6.  Would it kill you to add an LED or two for the camera in the back, Samsung?7.  Would it kill you to install a bigger battery in the phone?  I am willing to sacrafice a little bulk for it.8.  For contacts, it will show all the contacts in your gmail.  Dumb.  My old G1 knew to display only 'My contacs'  Hello, Samsung?I will wait for its updated version, Nexus S, and try my luck again.  Why?  Because I really don't like HTC phones.",4
"First things first, this phone is amazing!  The screen is crystal clear, and as the name implies; Vibrant.Pros: Amazing screen, blistering fast processor, Android, lots of storage, perfect fit for my hand, headphone jack, battery life (for a smart phone), and possibly best of all, not trapped to AT&T.;Cons: Signal strength, pre-loaded unremovable bloatware, slippery case, & FINGERPRINTS everywhere.As for the pros, I can't say enough about the screen, or Android. You just have to experience them for yourself.  But for the cons, I have to address each since this phone would be, hands-down, the best on the market today if not for them (hence the 4 star rating).  First off, the Signal Strength.  My last phone was a G1, and in my neighborhood I had reliable, steady signal (3-4 bars) and full 3g connectivity with it always.  The Vibrant occasionally has 4 bars, and usually has 3g, but it jumps between 0 and 4 bars, and 3g and Edge sporadically when in my hand, or just lying on the table.  I haven't had any complaints from anyone not being able to reach me, but the signal jumping is still concerning.  As is the bloatware.  Installed on my (my - as in MINE - as in I own it; not T-Mobile, not Samsung) are a few 'Pay as you play' apps (meaning monthly, or per-use charges apply if you are foolish enough to use them, or some child gets their mitts on your phone and accesses them, etc.) that I can not remove from MY device.  They are not essential to the operation of this device, nor are they essential to the T-Mobile network, so there is no reason I can see that they need to be unremovable.  Thirdly, the case, while some consider it 'cheap' feeling, is very smooth and feels very good to hold in the hand, but is slippery and hard to hold on to if you lose your concentration for even a second.  The good news, for us G1 upgraders, is that the G1 pouch fits the Vibrant nicely (not perfectly, but good enough).  Last is the finger prints.  This beautifully smooth case, and gorgeous screen that makes you want to touch them, retain your finger grease like nobodies business!  I suggest picking up an invisible shield cover since you'll be polishing it constantly, which will dull the shine on your case eventually (but, again there's silver lining: the Vibrant comes with 2 back shells, although one is purple).Not deal breakers, but annoying none-the-less.",4
"I've had this phone for almost a year and can assure everyone that it is an EXCELLENT phone. The reception, and call quality are good. It is very fast, not laggy, if I remember to clean out my text messages and don't let them build up. The camera and HD video are fantastic and I've used it enough to know. I love the MP3 player, the sound is excellent, with many equalizers and effects, the speakers are loud and have little distortion. I use the apps constantly for email, internet, youtube, facebook, Audible books, Nook books, and Kindle books and music. My kids use it for games constantly. The 16gb internal memory and the external micro SD card slot are holding many, many ebooks, photos, videos, and audible books. The emails aren't kept on the phone, but they could be transferred to memory. Texting is easy with SWIPE, and voice texting is good, google voice, so many other apps are available on the android markete place. This phone has everything. There is now a newer Galexy S 4g with Froyo 2.2. I will get that one later when my contract renews. The battery lasts all day but gets used up when the beautiful 4'amoled screen is on, so I turn down the brightness, and turn off the screen when I don't need it. I love this phone and I highly recommend it to everyone.",5
"I am upgrading from the Samsung Behold and the Vibrant is my first smart phone, I've only had it a week and I am very impressed with it so far The speed is as amazing as is the color screen. I do have a couple of cons but they aren't Deal breakers. What I would have liked was if the message notification alerts could ring out more than once so that you would know if you missed a call or message. (I don't really need a LED light but more than one ring would be nice considering that you are paying so much for the phone)Battery life isn't that great but I think once I stop playing with the phone so much I'm sure it will get better. All in All I think it is the best phone that T-mobile has out at the moment, but give me a few weeks and I'll let you know.",4
"While the phone has many positive features--and is generally lovable--as noted by other reviewers, a major problem is that the GPS does not work reliably. In my experience, none of the various proposed fixes posted throughout the web made a significant improvement. The consequence is that navigation--when it does seem to work--is often inaccurate (and wrong directions are probably worse than no directions at all). Once more, the phone will sometimes freeze up and reboot on its own (or require one to remove and replace the battery to restart) while trying to obtain its location (during which its battery consumption is rapid). Samsung has promised a fix for a while, but has not yet delivered, leading me to suspect that it may be an irremediable problem with the hardware. It's difficult to get past the frustration of thinking that the manufacturer and service provider released the product without disclosing such a glaringly obvious error, and for me, at least, that was enough to sour the love affair and replace it with another Android device.",3
"I have been hitting my very hard since the 14th and I can say that it's a pretty darn good phone. Perfect, no; you won't have any problems deciding to keep it. It might be worth noting that I had a iPhone and chose this over the iPhone.Here are the Slam-Dunk items:Display: The best. Really.CPU: Nearly the best. Really./GPU - makes all the difference!Storage: 16gb + whatever MicroSD you add. 2GB of app storage. 512MB Ram. Best-in-class.Battery: Properly configured with moderate use it will run all day without charging.Video Playback: All of my Non-DRM Handbrake/iPhone videos look better than ever.Audio: Better EQ and effect options that you could ever hope to have on iPhone though not as loud.Weight: Feels light in your hand. .5oz lighter than iPhoneCustomizable: You can do literally anything to this phone. Thank you T-Mobile and Samsung for easy root access!Minor Irritations:Buttons: Excuse me for liking hardware buttons. I miss the ability to answer the phone by pressing an 'Answer the Phone' button. Most new phones are going to soft buttons. The MyTouch 3g as bad as it is, has an excellent phone button.Apps: The standard Android Apps are really quite good. Samsung replaces these with their own with mixed results. Some things are better, but some interactions are actually worse. Fortunately, you can bring back some of them.The lack of a directional control: The original Galaxy S has a tiny little trackpad, this seems to be missing from all of the carrier versions. This makes tiny textbox edits a bit of a challenge.Overall, this phone is a world unto itself. It's just so deep, you will never get bored.",5
"First off, let me explain my title. The Vibrant is T-Mobile's official superphone because it is sold at T-Mobile whereas the Nexus One was being sold by Google. There you have it.Let me start off by saying that I was an early follower of Android with the first T-Mobile G1. Android has definitely come a long way since then, in hardware and software.I admit, I hated the G1's hardware so I sold it and moved on to the Blackberry Bold. With the Bold, I hated the software but loved the hardware. Unfortunately, my Bold's LCD cracked. I didn't want to purchase another phone yet, I was waiting out on all the new stuff that is suppose to come out such as the G2, Thunder (if it's TMO bound) and etc... I had no choice, I needed a phone so here I am with the Samsung Vibrant.First, photos of this phone doesn't do this phone justice. I was a little wary at first because it has an iPhonesque shape to it (Maybe that's why they took off the physical home button from our many versions). After seeing it in the store, I fell in love with the phone. The design is wonderful. The phone is very light (actually too light for my taste but that's all about preference). Let's move on to Pros and ConsPros-Nice screen size. 4 inches is perfect. It's not too big or too small.-Super AMOLED screen is beautiful and must be seen in person. Best screen I ever laid eyes on. If you are considering, go check it out in person. Again, pics and vids doesn't do it justice.-Android!!!-Battery not spectacular compared to my Bold but much better than the G1. Should last a good part of the day. (People state that the don't want to turn the brightness down from 100. I have mines on 50 and it's still beautiful, I don't think you need it that bright all day. Get a brightness widget and turn up when you need it)-Camera. This is a great camera. I told myself that I wouldn't get a phone without flash after the G1 but this Vibrant camera is wonderful. Night mode feature is great and very useful, you wouldn't even think about flash anymore. Trust me, the camera has a lot of useful features and the 720p video recording is awesome.-1Ghz Hummingbird processor. Very speedy and didn't notice any type of lag whatsoever.Cons-I don't like the placement of the Micro USB port on top on the phone. It just seems weird.-The plastic battery plate. I mean it's nice and comes with a different style spare but seriously? I wished it was metal or something similar.-Touchwiz UI. I don't like the iphonesque UI here. I wish it was stock Android but we could always change that later on......lol....There you have it. I recommend this phone, that's why I wrote this review. If not, go into a T-Mobile store, you can buy it and try it for 14 days. You can always return it but with this being their best phone, I don't think you would have a similar alternative if you did exchange it.....",5
"Well, this cable worked out great for the HTC Evo.  It does everything it's suppose to do.  The cable is your standard 3' length.  You can use it in conjunction with a HTC USB AC plug or you can plug it directly into your computer and have your phone charged that way.Overall it is a high quality cable.  It even comes with a small white sticker on it stating it was an HTC cable.  Please note that you may be able to find a similar cable cheaper elsewhere but for the comfort of having a HTC cable, it was worth the additional dollar.",5
"I bought this cable to use with a the USB wall-socket plug for my HTC Thunderbolt.  I needed a 2nd charger to use at work, and bought it to use with the TC U250 chargerTravel Charger U250, Black, for HTC Thunderbolt.  It worked great, and I haven't had any issues at all.The product description did not say that it would work with the Thunderbolt, instead claiming that it worked with HTC phones.  Just to confirm, it DID work with my Thunderbolt.",5
Bought the USB cable for my Evo 4G. Cable is great. Shipped to me a day before it was supose to arrive! Thanks will buy from this seller again!,5
"I was a little doubtful after reading the reviews that said it didn't charge, but figured $3 was worth the risk. This cable does exactly what it's supposed to (First day).",5
I didn't realize that the Droid was actually a computer that I could talk on until I did my research after purchasing the phone.  This also meant that it would not hold its charge as long as my previous phones.  So I needed to purchase an extra charger.This one fit the bill perfectly.  I am happy with my purchase and I highly recommend this brand for those people who are on the go and on the phone.,4
I will never order from CrazyOnDigital again.  The picture shows a single micro-usb data cable.  But when I get my order I get a dual micro usb cable.  You would think it would work the same but it doesn't.  When I plug my cell phone into my computer it doesn't read it.  The only thing it will do is charge the phone.  (((What a fake)).  The seller should not put up a picture of something and sell us something else.  I'm pissed off.,1
Bought a phone used and the cable was not working right.  Bought this one to replace it and it works very well.,4
"Cant go anywhere without a backup charger, especially in my car. This charges very quickly and fits my phone great!",5
"Works wonderfully in my car, my granddaughter loves it, very easy!  The cord needs to be a bit longer but other than that its fine!",5
"This is a life saver for anyone who drives.  I don't use it that often, but it is there if I need it and that is very important.",5
"Feels a little cheap (and at the price - I guess it should), but it works just fine. No problems with it at all...",4
"This is a good product, espically for the price. The cord is a little short, but it stretches where I need it to go.",5
The cord is not very long. it will not reach a past the front seats in a car.  Only charges when it wants to. if you move an inch it will not charge.,2
"I love this product, because it works as well as the original, but it costs much less. I would definitely recommend it.",5
this is a life saver. I am so glad i bought this and i should probably buy one for each car i have!,5
"I purchased this car charger for my sons car and we were pleased with it at first. But after awhile it stop working. It was generic and cheap, therefore it didn't hold up long. I would not purchase again or recommend these generic brand chargers.",3
"I bought this charger for my husband. He still uses it and keeps it in his car today. It takes the typical time to charge a phone (slower than the standard wall plug), but what do you expect. The price was great!",4
Product arrived quickly. Appeared ok. Very light weight. It fall part after 5 charges. The phone end of plug literally came apart. Tried to glue it but the aftermarket part was just too poorly made,1
"I bought two of these to replace some others that have failed in a relatively short period.  Hopefully these last longer.I did have to enlarge the openings on a couple of cases we have, but once inserted, it stays in well.The coiled cord is somewhat tight, so if the port on the car is not close to where you have the phone, it really pulls on the phone.We received these items in a few days after ordering.",4
the first one they sent did not work but they sent a replacement for free and it was good so am satisfied,4
Works well for my iPhone and is so much more economically priced than the ones at my cell carrier. Cord is the perfect length for my needs as well.,5
"I've this for several months and use it sparingly.  Always seems to work fine and no issues as of yet.  I will note it's a little large, but as long as it charges my phone, I'm good.",5
"Charges my phone great! Unfortunately the use of both USB ports fries my fuse, and my friends fuse in our cars so I am very skeptical to use it. I just use the one USB port and it works great.",4
"This is a great product. I thought I had lost my other Auto charger so I ordered this one. I ended up finding my old charger but I think this one is actually better. Delivered fast and I found that if you think the blue light is too bright, just pull the charger partly out of the slot and it goes off. It's not rocket science. Again, great product.",5
this adapter works great and is nice and small. The best thing about it is that I am able to charge my phone while my wife charges hers while on long trips.,5
Some reviewers said they had problems with charging high draw devices. I just wanted to eliminate the huge 12V adapter hanging out of my car's cigarette lighter socket. This works just fine and charges my LG VX5400 cell phone with no problems. The only high draw item I was using was a 5&#34; Garmin GPS. I simply purchased the Garmin hardwire cable for that (Amazon - about $12) and wired it to the fuse panel. Problem solved.,5
"Given that newer smartphones can draw 870 mA and often up to 1A or more -- that this adapter provides a rated 1A output means that your phone will charge faster than on 500 mA-class adapters.The form factor is nice and the 'handle' to pull it from the socket is a nice feature.Another great Elago product.(Elago makes a 500 mA version -- this one is the 'right' one, in my opinion)",5
"Charges both my iPhone 4 and 80GB iPod Classic (5th Generation). Was concerned that it might not charge one of the two since older iPod adapters don't work with my new iPhone 4. Nothing to worry here! Plugs right into my 2000 Honda Accord and 2003 Toyota Tacoma, so it's very versatile and love how compact it is. A small LED light does stay on when connected and works great at night, but if I don't want to see it, I simply unplug the unit. Thanks Elago, I don't have to buy a new  head unit to charge my Apple devices!",5
"We all have them now and for the car, two USB connections is not the easiest to find, so I am totally pleased and will buy again",5
"ProsSleek and simple2 ports allows charging multiple devicesThe port lights up; a minor thing, but better than nothingConsThe handle to remove it from the charging slot is purely aesthetic is functionally redundantThe price.  It's pretty hefty for such a little product since I've seen it bundled with other things",3
"Perfect for those who need 2 usb charging ports.  I am using it to charge my Evo with a usb cable.  The charger is pretty short and some cars who have deep cigarette outlets will have issues, but it does have a nice little handle to use to pull the charger out if it gets stuck.  I prefer the shorter one for a low profile look.I also own the Griffin Technology Powerjolt Dual and compared to each other, I prefer the Powerjolt.  The charger light on the elago is just a plane white light, which is nice, but not as classy as the Powerjolt's green light.  Too bad Amazon no longer sell the Powerjolt .All in all, it works and suites my needs.",5
Stopped working within 1 week. Too much trouble to ship back. Don't waste your time. Very cheap material and it shows.,1
"So! I purchased this and it doesnt fit my 4s. it is nice but thats alll...I wish it fits but it doesnt. it is nice to hold and handle but again, the fit",2
This case is amazing!!! It fits perfectly and it protects it perfectly also. I highly recommend this to anyone especially for under $3.00 :OThank you for this great case :D,5
this case fits good and seems very protective. it even has a &#34;lip&#34; where the front screen is so if u drop ur phone face down the glass wont shatter (hopefully). my only issue is when u use an after market charger it doesnt fit where the case is cut out there. u have to pull the bottom of the case off. other than this it's fine. the price was very good.,4
"if you have a skin designed for your phone, but still want to protect it, this is a good way to do it. The design is visible through the case, and the case protects the phone. good product",4
"It's perfect on White iPhones ! Only issue is the lock button is a little difficult to press,besides that it's perfect",4
"Edit: okay so today my iPhone took an unfortunate tumble on the hard, hot concrete. My phone literally bounced on each side and landed on its face. Immediately my Heart started beating fast and curse words flooded my mind...but to my surprise not a scratch, crack or blemish. The case stayed on snug & the only evidence of the fall was the dirt and dust that ended up on the phone and case. This may not be the result for all but I am glad it was that result for me.Added details: I'm 5'7 and my hands were at about waist level.-------------------------------'-------------------------------I ordered this case for my black iPhone 4 with Verizon and it fit perfectly snug, all ports are opened and available.I ordered this and did not realize that it said for AT&T; only, however when it did arrive I decided to still try it on and it worked better than another case I ordered that was suppose to be for the Verizon iPhone 4.I actually like how the case looks on my black iPhone it creates a grayish appearance. Maybe I lucked up but in my opinion it is well worth the price, I will be ordering another one just to have on reserve if anything should happen to this one.",5
The case works with flash and fits and like to have the clear case with my white phone but it was tough getting the case on! That would be the biggest downfall for it. I struggled to get this case on. Not fun. I wonder how easy it will be taking it off? Other than that good price and decent coverage for the front of the case.,4
"This case is made out of good material and it's well constructed. Although the plastic looks cloudy in the photo, it is clear when pressed up against the phone to reveal the nice metal work around the iPhone.This case I received is just the perimeter bumper and doesn't come with a clear back as shown. It's not a problem for me since I like the cleaner look. The bumper still raises the phone above any surface it rests on to provide a little bit of protection as long as the surface doesn't have any objects like pebbles that stick up to scratch the back surface.I originally gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because the photo didn't match, but it seemed good. I'm downgrading my review to 2 stars after only a few months of ownership since the plastic changed colors rather drastically. Sunlight dulled the plastic from clear to a light coffee color which isn't flattering at all to my white iPhone.",2
"Easy to put on phone. It is nice and tight, not loose. And it does protect the phone from scratches.",5
"This thing was so flimsy. It didn't fit on my iPhone, so it was constantly coming off. Would not recommend!",2
"I did not really like the way it was too loose on my phone, it was not much protection and the case got in the way of my camera lens a little.",3
This case is the best item I have ever bought for my iPhone. It isn't too bulky. It protects my phone and grips well. It shipped really quick too. I love this case and the seller. Definitely ordering from again :),5
Ya $1.90 I got raped.  If you want to get raped without a date rape drug buy this iteam. $2.00 will rape you and make you cry. The silicon case was so flat and streched that the iphone 4s is just sitting on it getting raped.. its to to loose like I said they gave. Me a decected one but who cares if you don't minde being raped ny them. Please don't buy unless you want to get raped or ripped off,1
I received a different product than shown in the sample pictures....apart from that it is a decent cover which will save ur phone from getting scratches on back side. Sometimes the cover comes out while keeping and removing from jeans pockets. Its not for rough and tough use... and anyway you will get for how much you pay.,1
"Excellent rubber case for the price.  I have ordered plastic cases in the past but after some time color peels off and case looks bad.  This rubber case is entirely black and no need to worry about color fading. Case provides cushion against minor bumps.  Protects against scratches, no need to remove case for charging and listening music.",5
used it for 2 years and had no issues at all.this is very light and it is very reliable. i dropped my phone quite a few times and it never had a scratch because of this awesome cover case.,5
"I bought this twice to use as a DIY case, but they are nice just as a black case as well.",4
Awesome case! Very handy and useful for the iphone.It resist a fall and fits in perfectly. Good choice for yout phone!,4
You get what you pay for; did not last very long.  The back of the case broke within a few days.,3
"This case was the first case i bought, and i love it and recommend it to anyone.Pros : Light weight, does not make phone look bulky, has good grip, wont slip out of hand, Fits perfect for iphone 4/4s, Looks good with lay on the table design, does not break or tear.Cons : Wont protect from 6ft drops",5
"It feels nice and fits snug. Looks sleek with the matte look. But..... It's not like the picture. The case does not cover the headphones jack or the lock button. Other than that, it's pretty cool.",3
great purchased very pleased with it and yes i would tell friends to buy more and keep up the great service,4
Good you just have to buy adapter piece to for the phone to charge...........still a great buy for any one,4
"it snaps on predictably and adds some black to a white phone if you aren't a fan of white devices.  The level of protection is not exactly amazing but dropping it while falling won't send you back to your cell retailer either.  You can spend more but if you can't, this can do fine.",3
This case is Great !! It fits my iphone 4S perfectly and the texture is really nice and it was super cheap Love Love Love !,5
the phone case really serves its purpose. it doesn't leave behind marks or coloration. simple phone case that does it right,5
"This is a great case for the iPhone 4. The Rubberized plastic has a great feel to it like the pricey slide-on cases for the previous generation devices (original, 3G/3Gs). The case comes in two pieces (front & back) which snap together. It's a great fit, doesn't close off any important parts of the phone such as the top-mic used for noise cancellation.",4
This is better than all those rubber cases. It wont slip off and it stays looking clean. This is a great buy.,5
I really don't have any complaints. It's a case that doesn't make your phone feel bulky and it keeps it safe. That's all I can ask for.,4
Charges the iPhone 4S or lower at a fast rate. Added plus is that it has a USB port on the top so you can plug another wire into it.,4
Now days USB chargers are built into cars. However I find myself driving a classic (paid for car and too cheap to upgrade). So I found this animal in the AT&T; store for an exorbitant price. I just purchased a new phone and was in a purchase craze and forgot to check here first.After I bought it I realized it had a light to help find and know when this critter is working.  And the USB was hidden under a slide thing. Looks like you can charge two phones at one time although I have not tried.Any way this charger has proven useful a couple of times and when not in use gives a feel of security by just knowing it is in the glove compartment.,5
"Was in a store about to buy a car charger for my new iPhone.  (I actually still miss my blackberry!)  A lady told me I should go to Amazon to get it as I would save money.  So, I dropped the $29.95 car charger and came her and could have bought 3 for what they wanted for one there.  It charges very well and the second USB port is a dream!  Buy this one if you need an iPhone car charger at all!",5
I got three chargers. All are high quality. The cost of the three combined was less than the cost of one lower quality charger at radio shack.,5
This AT&T car charger is the best I've used for my iPhone 4S! It works really smoothly & efficiently! I'd give it 5 Stars & recommend everyone owns an iPhone 4S Device to purchase it without hesitation!,5
"If you use your smart phone for mapping, you'll find this unit perfect. Stays put although the &#34;On&#34; light was a little too bright.",5
Nothing like the original product to make me happy. The after market items tend to be cheaper but so does the quality. Cant go wrong here!,5
These were ok chargers.  Not one of AT&T's best.  Shipped quickly. Price is fine for the product. Don't expect these to last for a long time.,3
Very reliable and useful. No complaints or malfunctions. Also has a handy additional port for another USB cable to charge an additional device.,5
"I ordered three of these, one for each vehicle, after reading lots of good reviews.  My experience however was disappointing.  Two of the three chargers didn't work at all.  One appears to work just fine... but given the other two were dead, I asked to return the entire order since I didn't trust the third one to last long.  The seller immediately refunded my purchase (great service), so now I'm ordering another product.  We'll see how that one works out.",1
"I purchased this one because I'm tired of China fakes.  This one made it sound like it as an AT&T; charger.  Based on the quality of the strain relief, I don't think so.I purchased 2 of these.  One for each car.  Seem to work great.  But...  If you pull the cord too much, the cable at the connector will become loose and not charge your phone.My definition of pulling too tight.  Some may say you cannot do that.  The cable obviously is looped so that it rolls up to be shorter when not in use.  We pulled the cord out about 1/2 to max length.  This seemed to put too much pressure on the connector.  I don't feel that is too much to ask.I would not buy this one again.",2
"The length of this cord is great, as it is fairly long so I can have my phone charging while I'm on the phone.",5
I have had this item for some time now and have had no issues with it and would recommend it to anyone.,5
"Received this today and tried it in my iPhone 4. It appears it works.However, the packaging it came in was a re-used ifrogz case package, said so on the back. Also know that there should have been a warranty document in the box and there was none.Hopefully it will keep working. I am contacting the shipper to see if I can get a warranty doc. All AT&T; products come with some type of limited warranty notice in the package.Good luck",2
This Charger works great at charging my iPhone 5 or iPad and my girlfriends iPhone 4.  It seems to charge both of them at the same time without much trouble.  Its a little slow since its charging 2 devices at the same time but it eventally does charge them both.  I'm happy with it.Highly recommended!,5
"They appear to be official AT&T packaged - maybe liquidated? Unsure, but they are of the same quality and include the USB slot for an additional (USB) charger. Just as good as the $25 charger I got from AT&T - but for $9 :)",5
"This car charger has been great!  On a recent long trip, it allowed us to charge both of our phones at the same time, which is exactly why I bought it.  Can't say enough good things about it.",5
I was concerned whether this would really work -- you never know with some of the electronics items.  It works great!,5
"I'm glad I got this one.  There's an LED that lights when this is plugged in and it has the (now old style) plug that fits 4s and earlier iOS product.  The coiled cord has retained it's elasticity over time and the USB on the back of the charger allows simultaneous charging of other accessories while charging the primary device.Solid and reliable, it's a car charger that you won't be disappointed with.",5
"they literally gave me a broken defective charger. i thought because i was buying from the actual at&t  that i wouldn't get ripped off. i thought wrong, they gave me a charger that didn't work at all.",1
"Very useful and gets the job done.ALSO, THERE IS ANOTHER USB ON THE WIRE!Had is for two years and I am happy to say it was worth the refurbished price of 5 dollars!",5
bought this for my husband to go with his new iphone. was perfect and alot cheaper than the att store,5
Great car charger.  I've used the kind that you plug you USB cable into and those seem to have issues or not be of good quality.This stays in my car so the 1 piece(all connected) was perfect option for me.  It is a great charger and great for the price!!Highly recommend I use my phone often and travel for work.,5
"I have only had it a week, but so far it is awesome.  Keeps the 4S charged (as you know we are having some battery draining issues...) anyway it's high quality and works like a charm.",5
"I'm not sure if this is really from AT&T (packaging looks fake), but it's been working for me for months.  Much less expensive than anything from the AT&T store and it works well.  I have one for each of our cars and they both work well.",5
Plugged in and works well. Charges fast and can charge two phones at once with the USB port. Great price compared to the ones in the store,5
This charger is well.  It connects to the car on the 1st try every time (as opposed to some require moving or turning them to get a contact.)  I'd buy this one again if I need another one ... I hope I don't lose this one like the last one.,4
"I cant say I am completely unhappy with this device. It is relatively cheap considering the cell phone boosters out there. The issue I have is that this does not work as a cell phone signal booster, but more like it says in the beginning of the name..an extender. It takes whatever signal you can get at a good location near a window in the house and can extend it to whatever location you place it in the house. This sounds good in theory but if you have a weak signal to begin with (mine is about 35% GSM only at best), that is exactly what you will get where ever you place the booster and around it. It works good to cover areas that are complete dead zones and my signal used to be 0% there and my calls would drop if I moved around, but I was hoping that the booster part in the name was more than just that...a name. It will not boost your signal any more than the maximum you can get at a good location. So I can make and receive calls and have very few dropped calls, but the quality of the calls is general bad. So unless you can get good to excellent coverage at some point in the house, this will not help you. That is why I say the name and description using the term boost, is misleading. It can only extend, not boost!",2
"Works as advertised, suction cups kind of cheesy but they work.  Boosts my signal by 1-2 bars.  Follow install instructions and tips on the FAQ on the website.  This thing works as long as you get some type of usable signal.  Place the main unit in the middle of the area you want signal.... not on the floor or in the corner.  Make sure to secure the coax in case the suction cups fail!  Boosts Sprint, Verizon, and Cricket so far.  Very happy!",4
"I tried several places in my home and finally contacted Tech support at WiEx and learned that  ' The unit is a simple amplifier so it pulls in signal from the window and re-broadcasts the signal around the base unit.' And I was expecting to increase from 1-2 bars to 4-5 bars on my Verizon IPhone for the $200-300 the unit cost me.  So, if you have good signal outside your home but not inside, this unit will probably help. But if you are like me and you need a BOOSTER to obtain a better signal inside  your home, don't waste your time.",1
"Update April 2014:  Gave it to my school teacher son.  He has signal issues at his house as well and it didn't work well for him either.  Again, I recommend a more expensive roof mounted unit.We constantly had to take our phone to the booster to 'touch it to the antenna' to get my phone to accept the boosted signal.If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a different, more expensive roof mounted system.  It's definitely not worth the money.",1
We installed this at work in a cement building where no service was something that e just expected.  Now we have full bars and 3G all the time.  It is amazing and totally worth every penny.,5
"Really improves marginal signal for me and I'm not usually enthusiastic about tech solutions. I have to have good SMS and WAP signal to hear about and to receive tech work for my business. This device only works on 2.5 G (Edge, WAP, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz signals). Do not expect it to improve your 3G since it doesn't hit 3G frequencies (except maybe Verizon?).I live in a rebar-reinforced masonry and concrete bottom floor on the opposite side of the building from the nearby tower. Before installing, I got NO SIGNAL throughout most of the 1500SF apt (except at some walls by windows, where I got 1-3 bars with some fluctuations, except at one relatively reliable window and at another flaky window - depends a lot on signal bounces and bends). Now I get 3+ bars of Edge throughout the apt with the exception that the incoming signal at that window is still a little flaky. The only thing keeping this from a 5-star rating is that it doesn't do 3G or enhance my 2nd phone's signal (that could easily be due to having a different tower location).",4
i bought this for use with t-mobile phones hooked it up as the instructions said and no difference what so ever could be found in the signal strength even when using a cell radio diagnostic app on my s4,1
"second try with these, same result for my setupOriginally tried Wireless Extenders zBoost YX545 SOHO Dual-Band Cell Phone Signal Booster but this one does the same as that, no increase in signal, randomly goes to the &#34;red&#34;  poor performance mode without moving anything and having the setup within the suggested guidelines of the instructions",1
"I live in a an apartment that has zero to almost no cell phone reception. Even standing by a back window (facing an antennae about 400' away) gives poor reception. I don't think the two chainlink fences help much. For this reason, I maintained a landline, since I could not be reached when at home. I researched various boosters and this model came in with the best general reviews for the price I could afford. It's not without it's negative reviews, but I did read every review and considered how specific and detailed a review was. I also first researched where the cell towers and and antennae are in my neighborhood, so I knew I had good line-of-sight to a source signal. Some assembly required. The antennae comes with two different lengths of suction cup mounts for attaching to windows. The longer 2-3' set allows one to swivel the antennae towards the best signal. My best signal faces the window, so I used the shorter set to mount it nearly flush.  I read the installation instructions, specifically regarding where to place the antennae (up high, at least 24' away from metal - and clearing that fence I mentioned earlier). Once I plugged it in, I immediately saw a boost of 2-3 bars anywhere in the apartment. The base station I put just about central to my apartment, and per instructions, at the same height. This model states it's designed for 1500 square feet, but my apartment is 3750 sf and I still get a signal pretty much anywhere. Obviously, it is stronger the closer I stand to the base station (full bars), but I now get at least one to two bars where I had total dead spots before. From where I sit at my computer, it's about 12' to the base station through two angled walls, and I still get 2-3 bars, sometimes just one, still a big improvement from zero. I have to put some effort into finding a dead spot. It didn't work for some. It's not perfect, but it's working for me, and in a larger area than it states it is designed to work.",4
"This isn't as pictured.  It comes in parts and with 40 feet of coax cable.  You're supposed to run it at least 8 feet away between the base unit and the suction-cup antenna.  It's also not upgradeable - it only works for two bands for the older phones and doesn't work with the new 4G phones.  When you upgrade to a new phone, this thing is no good to you.  Additionally, it's cheap construction and it doesn't work particularly well indoors - and they have about a dozen &#34;upgrades&#34; all over $60 each that are supposed to make it work better.  So for the money you pay, you get teased into paying a LOT more to get it work correctly.  All that and you can't upgrade it.  Junk.",1
"The unit is easy to setup.  I purchased it in place of a YX-510 that was struck by lightning.  Did not work at first and technical support solved the problem.  Antenna needs to be placed correctly.  Ours was mounted in our attic, not on a window.  If it is not right side out and level, it will not work.  The rest of the install was a breeze.The unit just works.  There is no feedback with lights like the older 510 unit.  No flashing feedback saying it has signal or is working, just one green power light.  I would like to see something confirming it was working...Just me I guess.As I said it just works.  Signal was boosted from 0 bars to 2 bars.  When in a call it actually goes up to 3-4 bars.  Excellent clarity.  We live in a ranch with plaster walls, and it even gives us signal in the basement! My wife has T-Mobile and I have ATT.  Both services work great and simultaneously.",4
"The booster is working as advertised and was very easy to install.  When I bought it, I was thinking 1500 linear feet for the range but after I installed it and didn't see those results, it dawned on me that 1500 sq ft is actually about 39' from the base unit in any direction which is roughly what I'm getting.Normally, I would get 1-2 bars, now I'm getting 3-4.  There could be an external factor contributing to the low bar increase as the instructions say the antenna should be placed at least 2 ft from metal objects.  However, since it attaches to a window and all of mine are louvres with a metal frame, that's not possible.  Still, it's doing what I need it to do, so I'm good.The one negative for me is that to maximize the boost range the instructions say to place the base unit in a central interior location, but running the coaxle cable through the interior of my home is problematic.",4
"I wanted something simple for my new iPhone 4, so this won out.  Installation was a breeze.  Got the screen cover to go on with no bubbles on the first try.  The leather backing wasn't as thick as I thought it would be though.  I was hoping for a little more padding for the back of the phone.  It's maybe a little overpriced and would be more worth it if it cost closer to $10 cause of this.  Otherwise I like the look and feel and ease of installation.",4
"I product does look like the pictures shown. But my problem is with the back fake leather cover it will not stay in place. I did a proper cleaning and properly installed item. But after being in my pocket all day it moved. It wasn't to hard to pull it off and re-apply it did not leave any residue witch is good but when it gets warm it wont stick! It slides, And correct me if Im wrong but don't all phones get warm. Also the material looks like it shrunk some so there is a exposed edge all around the back of phone even with the bumper installed. The front protector that it comes with is pretty good not the best but okay its very clear but I don't like the texture its got resistance to sliding your finger (not smooth like glass) It's not as smooth as it could be or others I have had, but looks durable so far. Over all this would be okay if it were under $10 bucks. And if the back would stay in place.",3
This only provides a classy leather look to your iphone. This will not protect it from any other damage besides the random scratch/scuffing on the back. This will also not be a re-stickable piece in the event you switch your phone in for a replacement. It's mainly just for looks.,3
"This skin shrinks by a bit over time. Not sure why, but it does! If you're thinking of getting this, just know that it shrinks. The concept is great, but I'm really disappointed with it. I might as well just get a real case that actually covers the back of my phone now.",2
"Very pleased with this back cover.  It has stayed on well so far, fits nicely,looks nice, but please note it does not have a leather smell whatsoever.",5
"5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely fabulous, August 10, 2010By  S. geddamuri 'Geddamuri' (chicago usa) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)This review is from: SGP Steinheil EX iPhone 4 Screen & Body Protector Set [Ultra Crystal] (Wireless Phone Accessory)The best i have seen for ever.In one word,It is as good as naked iphone 4 screen.Added advantage is that it has little resistance.So it wont slip while operating on screen as it would if it is naked.The disadvantage is same as it is naked screen.Finger prints will be there .But that will be there even without screen protector.Moreover the the screen protector is very easy to install.One thing to note while installing is to do all in one step.Once you finish installing and you discover bubbles,then it will be hard to peel without damaging the edges where you try to peel.So install slowly and remove bubbles at the same time.Shipping was very fast.Friday evening ordered.Received by Monday morning.I have used zagg,bodyguardz.But they are not even 40% close to this one.Recommended 100%.",5
Perfect I love the rubber sides all around.(not sticky rubber) Hugs the corners just the way i like it. I had a Speck pixel Hd i didn't like the slippery it gave so I ended up with this and I luv it.,5
"The Griffin Reveal Etch is a handsome case. It even feels great with good quality materials. Unfortunately for me, it has one fatal flaw. The rubber sides do not fit very snug to the phone. It may be okay for some, but everytime I hold the phone, I'm reminded of that fact.Pros:- Very nice look and feel- Adds minimal bulk to the phone- Good access to phone controls- Good compatability with connectos and docks- Provides a good grip to hold iPhone- Rubber sides do not pick up lint- No camera flash issues for meCons:- Fitment of rubber sides is loose- Slighly slow to slide in/out of pockets- Not 100% confident on case's drop protectionCurrently, my favorite iP4 case is the Incipio Silicrylic, but I will be giving the Speck Pixelskin HD and Incipio NGP a shot at the title.",4
"You really can't go through life with an unprotected iPhone. 'Going commando' with your phone is asking for trouble. You bump it, you put it on tables and other grotty surfaces, you drop it, you drag it in and out of your pocket dozens of times each day. Griffin's Reveal Etch has a nice 'rubber' edge that protects the front and back nomatter which way you put it down and it's grippiness is perfect - it won't slip out of your hands nor will it snag while trying to wrestle it out of your pocket. For me, it's the perfect case. Go for it, you can't go wrong.",5
I ordered this one for my husband who uses a cell phone constantly in his business.  He wanted something sleek and easy to get in and out of his pants pockets.  This phone fit the bill.,4
"I wanted a case that didn't detract or bulk up my new iPhone 4, and this case, one of the freebies Apple offered to iPhone users with reception problems, is simply perfect for my needs. I had purchased a temporary case, Premium Soft Silicone Gel Skin, that served the purpose well, but this case is much, much better. It has a hard, slightly recessed back that hugs the camera lens and soft, comfortable silicone sides to aid your grip. The back edges have a silicone lips to keep the phone from sliding off a surface. The case is held in place by the silicone lip, so any tears might compromise it; however, the edges fit so perfectly that they don't easily pull away, something my temporary case did. Although the silicone areas make certain parts tacky, I have no problem pulling it in and out of my pocket.Except for the silicone lip, the entire front is unprotected, and except for the camera cut-out, the entire back is covered. The lock/power switch is covered by a raised nub, which allows you to use the button without its being uncovered. Even better, the mute button is easy to reach and use, something that has always been a potential problem with iPhone cases.As of this writing, the price makes this case a great deal for any iPhone owner, even if you're reading this after Apple has fixed the infamous 'death grip' issue. Early cases were expensive and untested; this one is both relatively inexpensive and solid, a good choice for those who want a low-profile case.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5
"works as intended, mounts on my 2011 Jetta and works great.Does not work with iPhone 4 bumper on so have to take that off if i want to use it with this but still works awesome.",5
"this is a good idea but you cant put the phone in the mount if it has a case on it and i dont feel much like removing it everytime i get in the car, which is a lot.. i think i threw this out.",3
I bought this particular one because it was reasonably priced but the plastic is hard and the fit and finish aren't that good. The clips that you use to attach the mount to your air vents are hard to pinch open make it difficult to install and remove on a regular basis when switching cars.,2
"The item is exactly what I wanted, problem is that it cannot work with a CaseCrown iPhone 4 and 4S Glider Slim Fit Case - Black Obsidian (Fits AT&T;, Sprint and Verizon iPhone 4 and 4S), it has to be modified. The Mount only works with the iPhone 4 as long as it is not in a case. I literally had to cut off the bottom 1/3 of the cradle (the curled up plastic pieces at the bottom) so that the phone and case would fit. The phone then slots into the side holders and slides up to the top holder, no problem. It is installed in the A/C vent of my Nissan Navara (Frontier) which is right hand drive, and fits as intended so I suppose that left hand drive vehicles will be fine. I am in construction and live on the road, some of which are really bad and vibrate a lot. The phone is yet to fall out or become dislodged since installation. Good product, but again, can't work with a case. Hope that this helps.PS: Also purchased:1. A Griffin Technology 1 amp PowerJolt Dual Micro for iPhone and iPod (Black). Griffin dual USB charger works great, two outlets, one for my iPhone and the other for the Ipad.2. A CaseCrown iPhone 4 and 4S Glider Slim Fit Case - Black Obsidian (Fits AT&T;, Sprint and Verizon iPhone 4 and 4S).  Case is great! Need a screen film as it does not cover the screen. Case is slim and fits exactly, not loose or too sticky, so goes into pockets with ease. Good cut outs for camera/flash, speakers and ear piece.3. A Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone (Black, Retail Packaging). Voice recognition is so so. Connects easily to iPhone 4, volume is easily adjustable and works well with windows up or down. Sound quality is good.",2
This divide works wonderful for my IPhone. It is easy to use & if I have my GPS app in IDE it is at the perfect level to see easily. Love it!,5
This phone holder is perfect for hands free and bluetooth usage.  Only thing that'll get you is blocking your vents but you can adjust to the top vent and swivel it sideways.. very durable!,5
"This product is very fragile.  It does not have a good grip with the air vent, and the biggest issue is that the phone does not fit with a case! :/  It is a major hassle to take the phone case on and off.",2
Bought this for a friend...the color was Really nice and it fit her phone perfect. This was a pretty good buy with the exception of the fact that the color rubs off after a bit of wear and tear...but thats to be expected,4
"I was an idiot for buying an expensive case that broke within a few months...This one is fine and at this price, I bought two.",5
This was as advertised and I was very skeptical and wary but they came - match perfect to the phone and really protect it while not blocking any buttons or  speaker - camera  etc.I will buy from this one again. don't let the price fool you - these products are very good.,5
"Fast shipping. very fast. I like the feel and the dark shade it has to it. My boyfriend liked it...because its not too busy...ALSO, GREAT PRICE!",5
"It looked a little better in the picture but, it's hard plastic like the title said. but, thing is the color is like a little dusty.. I like how it's like red with a black tint to it but! it look like a kindergardener painted it... I don't know but, it you just want a quick phone case and not a serious one this is the way to go. :)for LG Rumor Touch LN510 Hard Case Cover Dark BLUEIt was something like this one different company though I think IDR",3
it came at the time it said and my wife loves it so what can i say its a 5 star if it makes my wife happy great for the price,5
This product is a good one. I like the colors and durability. It arrived on time and there was no issues with the product.,4
I do not have this phone anymore but this was one of my favorite cases. Plus it lasted a while. It wasn't too protecting tho just more of a nice look.,4
This case is neat and very very colorful. If you like a lot of color you will love this one.,5
"The case was so smooth that it was borderline slippery. The snap on case did not snap together very well. The material doesn't feel like it would protect anything. The only upside was that the case was very pretty. I would not recommend this case to anyone, and suggest sturdier alternatives instead.",2
this is a really cute case. I no longer have this phone but wish I had another case like this. It was really durable. Hard plastic.,5
i purchased this product for a friend because she liked the on i purchased for my daughter so i wanted to give her something like it,4
"my case fits perfectly, i havent had it for even an hour but from the looks of it now, i like it.....ITS NOT RUBBERIZED AT ALL!!! Not sure if it will fade or not but i like what i bought and the price was nice too",5
This case is very cute & have had a lot of complements on it.The snap on cover just helps to add to this really cute case. It was delivered before promised.,5
"This case is really very nice. It's colorful and kinda like clear but not white background, its silverish. Very nicely made with a real nice finish for gripping phone. All in all, a great little cover at a excellent price! Highly recommended!!!",5
Nice Case but can't use therefore I got a new phone right. After I ordered this I'll find someone that could use it,5
"Our kids are playing with our iPhones constantly.  Most silicone cases come off so easily that we have to fear our phones will be dropped on the floor without the cases (which has happened in the past).  Not only do these cases fit very snugly, but they are also much more difficult to take off accidentally because of the &#34;pocket&#34; down at the bottom of the case that holds the phone all the way around, including coverage of the home button.  In that spot, there is a raised silicone button on the case that depresses the home button on the phone when pushed.  With a raised home button, as opposed to the typical recessed button without a case, there is a slight chance of accidentally pushing the home button and activating the Siri function, but I have not found this to be a problem.  There is only one very slight issue I have with this case, and it is not even significant enough for me to ding the rating from 5 stars.  On the raised silicone button, there is a red painted square.  After less than 2 weeks of usage, that square is starting to wear off.  No big deal for me, but worth mentioning.",5
Because its great like they say u can change the color when u wanted and is a great price you will love it,5
I love the cases. I kept a few for my self and have a few away. This was a real great price and I love the quality of the product.,5
"GREAT PRODUCT, FITS GREAT AND COLORS ARE VIVID AND NO BLEMS! VERY WELL BUILT AND GREAT PRICE!! CAN NOT GO WRONG HERE!!",5
"These fit my iPhone perfectly and are very colorful. I wouldn't say they would protect it well if dropped, but I don't drop my phone very often, and that isn't what I got them for.  They are strictly to match every outfit in my closet!",5
"So I ordered these case's because it was cheap, but when they came I was happy with quality... but they are poorly made! If you have a clear coat or screen protector they rip off the edges... So I stopped using this case from now on.... DONT GET UNLESS YOU HAVE A NO SCREEN PROTECTOR!",2
ok for a quick fix if no protection but they do not fit snug and tend to roll on the edges . would suggest buy better quality,2
"They are what they say, nothing more, nothing less. What I expected. Lots of colors so I can change it all the time. They are soft rubber so feel good on the phone. thin, flimsy. Not sure much protection, more just for fun. Great deal for the price if you are just looking to accessorize the phone.",4
"These bad boys are bomb!! They allow me to change my phone case everyday and since thats what i like to do, they are wonderful. They fit the phone good, but the only bad thing is the flash hole. Its kind of small, so the photo has a tint of whichever case you have.",5
"I love matching my iphone cases with my outfit and for $11 I get 10 colors! This is awesome. I received my package today, and they are easy to put on and take off unlike the hard cases for the Iphone where you scratch the sides peeling some of those off. These are flexible, pretty, and true colors. I definitely recommend this bundle if you are a fashionista like me.",5
"I bought this to mount my iphone to my bike when I ride.  it is great.  the mounting clip (not the ottercase product) came off once and this skittered across the pavement with no damage to the phone or the case.  amazing.  and it doesn't overheat when it is hot out, like the zip-up cases are reported to do.  it is bulk, which is OK for putting in my pocket for a quick trip, but too bulky to put in a dress shirt or suit.  But, it only takes about 30 seconds to swap this case for my normal slim case if I'm not riding.There are a few bubbles under the screen, as reported, and I haven't tried the baby powder fix, but it's not really annoying.  the nice thing is that now the screen seems to work when my fingers are wet/sweaty, which isn't always the case with the iphone itself, and the protective screen seems to unpolarize the iphone screen so that it is viewable from any angle with polarized sunglasses on.",5
the clip broke off on day 1.  otterbox used to be one of the best guess I'm going back to Seidio.,1
Great phone case and holster. Easy to use. Only drawback is letters on edge of screen are hard to hit with case on.,5
I received this item very quickly in new condition in it`s origianal seeled package as advertised new conditioned.Buy this product.,5
I have hade a iPhone since they came out. And this is the only case I used on my 3GS. Dropped multiple times and the case takes the damage but not the phone. I didn't like the holster because they would brake easily but the case is great!!! Always can hear clear sound out of it!!!,4
Good product'. Quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described. I am Very satisfied with this purchase,5
Like the title says I believe this is the best iPhone case Otterbox or anyone else has ever made. The new iPod 4G and iPhone 4 cases are not nearly as tough or well-made I'm sorry to say. Still a loyal Otterbox customer though.,5
"This is an original otter box, great price and great quality product.  If you have this phone you know it is getting hard to find a case for it, and this is the case to get.",5
"This case ends up in the bottom of tool bags with hard tools, used in damp conditions, kids play angry birds and it falls off of the occasional ladder. You get to see how capacitance touch screens don't work too well when damp, and then you just wipe it off and keep working.  The case makes the iphone a true 'work phone'.  Given that it's an iPhone it's too bad the 'phone' doesn't work so well.  I'm not asking Otter to fix that issue.Only one complaint- the case appears to degrade the already lackluster camera picture quality a bit- the lens window is hard to keep clean.  Not sure how to improve that.As it stands now, after two years and two separate owners, it's still functional.The silicone case has torn in two places, protective window is scratched to hell.  protective shell has lost bits around the power and earphone connectors from actually being dropped many times.  It holds up.  Still more protective than many newer designs.While it still works, it's getting a little too ugly since the silicone case is the only thing holding the plastic case together in several spots, where it once snapped tightly together- It's time to retire it.  I'm getting another one, no question about it.",5
"This is the best case ever made for iPhone 3GS, bar none! It's samurai armor for your iPhone. This is my 3rd OtterBox that I've purchased for this phone and I will not put anything else but OtterBox on it again! Protects against everything but water! Great buy! Total protector for something very valuable!",5
Wonderful case second one I bought just because I broke the clip but its tough saved my phone many times,5
"I dropped my iPhone 6 hours after I took it out of its box. I immediately ordered a Defender to protect it from future accidents. The case is excellent for protecting the phone, however, the clip broke on the holster 3 days later (what a bummer). The case is very well made and attractive too. The holster is nice, but the clip unlike the case, does not allow for rough handling. Hopefully, OtterBox beefed up that clip for the iPhone 4 and 5 series.",5
I love my OtterBox Defender Case.  I had looked all over the mall for the OtterBox Defender Case and they all sold for $41-$45.  So with a little patience I waited for four days and got the OtterBox for half the price of the one at the mall. and I love it!!,5
"I purchased this for my 8 year old son who uses an iPhone 3GS without a SIM card (like an iPod touch). The Otterbox works as advertised. Yesterday afternoon we are walking around the neighborhood and he tossed his phone up in the air! He caught it, and I quickly let him know if it breaks we are not replacing it. He tossed it again and this time missed the catch!!! The iPhone landed on the concrete sidewalk smashing hard on the top right corner. The Otterbox earned it's value - no damage at all to the iPhone! The best part was my son put the device in his pocket for the rest of the afternoon!",5
I dropped my phone so many times and this case did so much to protect it.I loved the built in screen protector and really just everything about this case was awesome.If I had to pick one negative I would say the case is a little bulky but I'd rather it be bulky than broken.,5
Was as described.  Worked fine when it was used.  Would recommend to those who have a iPhone 3G or 3GS.,5
"When my boss purchased new iPhones for each of the crew leaders in the company, he also did us the wonderful favor of purchasing these protective cases for us, as well. These cases are extremely solid and do a great job of protecting our phones. I have dropped my phone at least a dozen times in the past two years and have not had one problem with it - thanks in large part to this case. Because I paint, I rarely keep the belt clip/holster on my person. it just gts in the way of all my movements and I really don't want to get the case or the phone covered in paint. The case, though, has only come off two time in two years - both times for a cleaning. Like a tattoo, once the case is on, it's pretty difficult to get it off, but that's just fine by me. There's almost no reason to take it off. I haven't found that the protective plastic covering the screen interferes with the touchscreen's functionality in any way.A great product that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who needs good protection for their phone!",5
"The item arrived in the condition advertised and on time. The case itself however by design makes it very difficult to carry around because it is too heavy and big, so I can only use it while camping outdoors and alike.",3
"Same comment as the previous Otterbox review. Good product, just not what I expected. I was looking for an unbreakable case.",2
I got it for my father in law and we loved it.  The iphone had a bad dent on the bottom corners and this Otter Box made it look like new and gave it the best protection.,5
They have always arrived way ahead of time. The packaging is good and it arrived in package complete. This is the 2nd one i have purchased in less than 2 weeks and i got the first one in 3 days then second in 4.,5
"Great case, very tough, I am hard on phones and this case took everything that was thrown at it. I recently switched to an Iphone 5 and again purchased an Otterbox case. My 3gs was 3 years old and thanks to this case I still received and decent amount of money on my trade in.",5
"Great not my first Otter but for this old raged iPhone 3Gs it will be its last otter. Not much to write about an old OtterBox. It's good construction hard to get the headphones in and out. Adds a little more dimension to the clunker. It should have a padded little area in the back like this iPhone 4 otter box, but it sadly doesn't...",5
a mirror and a phone. Lord knows i need it more than others some days. Inside use is normal;Makes it hard to see the screen in outdoor light/sunlight. Screen must be on battery sapping 'bright as day' settings.,4
I have bought this product again. It works fine for my iphone and i get alot of compliments. Great buy.,5
IT CAME WITHIN THE TIME SPAN THEY SAID IT WOULD COME... FOR THE PRICE I PAID I GOT 5 COVERS AND THEY ARE GREAT.. ALSO GOT CLEANING CLOTH WITH IT... WHICH I DIDNT EXPECT TO GET ..VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT,5
"These are really inexpensive screen protectors that look a little bit better in the photos than in real life.Pros:Protector is slightly thicker than the protector that came with my 3G.It is easy to fit over your screen for application if you go slowly.The mirror effect is cool in itself.Very easy to apply without bubbles forming.It is very inexpensive.Cons:The mirror effect is not like a mirror but more of a flat silvery color.The cover shows minor scratches very easily.Bubbles can be taken out with a credit card, but minor scratches occur.Unlike a clear screen cover, this one has a fine grid, but you can easily see past it.Brightness (outdoors) makes reading a little difficult.For the price and for what you get, it is a deal. It is simply a matter of what you want your iPhone to look like.",3
the product was ok because it fit the phone and it delievered the mirror affect but you cant see your phone home screen well!,3
Very useful thing. Protects the screen and looks very sexy. I always preferred mirror screen protectors on all of my cell phones. This one looks better than I expected and fits absolutely great.Thank you!,5
this is a standard run of the mill grade quality screen protectors that has a mirror finish. Installation was simple and the cloth helps keep the screen from smudges.,4
There's nothing like an offer box.  They make the best stuff hands down. One of our employees who works outside used his four year before the rubber casing wore out.,5
"First off, to all you people reading the bad reviews first (like I do), I say - DO NOT BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS.Here's what happened to me... I purchased the iPhone4 within the first month of it's being available and immediately noticed that the reception was bad. People couldn't hear me talking to them and calls were dropped on a regular basis. But I kept '4' because it is marvel of modern engineering and beautiful to look at and a wonder to hold.Besides, texting is the new talking and I needed a mini-computer on my persons at all times.  So, I purchased a cheap temporary case which I promptly returned after Apple sent me the free bumper I ordered.The bumper is very minimalist so I can still appreciate the phone's good looks and the quality of it's calls quickly improved- not one dropped call when the '4' is encased.  I was happy.  Until the small scratch I discovered right on the Apple logo one day!  Then, it suddenly hit me- 'THIS PHONE IS MADE OF GLASS, back and front, AND I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PROTECT IT!'  I knew that just one-drop at a bad angle at which the glass comes into contact with the sidewalk and it would be all over. Even if the phone continued working, I wasn't going to walk around with a phone bearing a cracked display. YUCK!Hence the search for the very best case for my iPhone began. First I went to Bestbuy to visually inspect and physically handle some cases.  I saw that only the Defender blocked the dock opening which is important for me since that opening allows dust and debris to enter too easily. Then I spent hours on amazon looking at and reading about 4 different suitable cases.Instinctively, I knew that the Defender was what I NEEDED but I thought that it would be absolutely sacrilege  to cover-up the 4's beauty. I turned to reading all the reviews on amazon, starting with the negative ones- like I always do. What I read disturbed me.  People were saying that the case makes the iPhone too bulky to hold, that it attracts dust like a magnet, even going so far as to state that that it couldn't fit in ones pocket!  Well, because of those negative people I held-off on getting the Defender for about 2 weeks even though I knew that only it would offer me the piece of mind I so desperately needed.The Defender was added to 'my cart' on amazon and I mulled it over in my mind.  On the same day on which 'my cart' informed me of a price drop, I said 'What the hell, I can always return it' and ordered it.I am now whole and all is well with the world.Here are the...PROS:1- The '4' is now very well protected. Front, back, sides, top and bottom. Everything. A see-thru layer of plastic protects front from scratches. Flip-down rubber hatch protects the dock entrance on the bottom. Rubber hatch protects the headphones port on top when not in use. You just lift it when needed, which is great because now even thick plugs will fit, unlike with the bumper that I was using before. Protection for the volume button and the power button is built-in, molded into the case design. One last hatch on the side protects the silent/vibration switch.2- Speaker, microphone, camera, flash, and sensor are unaffected but well protected.3- The holster is very well made and holds the phone securely. You can hold the phone with the screen showing or flipped over. I don't use headphones often because I like to keep my ears open to other sounds as well, so I sometimes holster the iphone with the screen showing(so that I can use it without unholstering it) and the speaker pointed up towards my ears and listen to my podcasts and multitask.And the CONS:1- If you keep it in your pocket, then yes, the silicone will attract lint- ie: 'pocket debris'.2- This case will double the thickness of the '4'  (But it will be well protected and I noticed that it now feels better in my hand. The chances of my dropping it now are slim to none!)3- There is no instruction booklet explaining how to get it on to your phone, only a diagram on the inside of the packaging which lays it out for you in a too-simple kinda way.Warning: Do it right the first time. If you aren't 'mechanically inclined' then get someone who is - to get this IRON MAN case around your '4'.And there you have it, 2 hours of my time spent ranting about my experiences.So, if you feel you need this level of protection then just get it.  You will get used to the size very quickly.",5
"Quality is great, defense is great for the phone, but the bulkiness makes you feel like you're back in the nineties with those old brick phones.  I chose to use the phone without.  Insurance will cover most damage anyways.",3
Glad I brought this product for my iPhone. Does its job of protecting the iPhone from drops and liquid splashes....,5
This case is awesome but has one minor flaw.  There are sometimes watermarks or bubbles under the screen.  Good news is that it very easy to fix!You can use almost anything to clean the screen of the otterbox and iphone screen.then use a blow dryer on a low setting dry off both the otterbox screen and the iphone screen.  Keep the blow dryer about 12' away from each and it doesn't get very hot at all.  Do this for a minute or so.Then when you put the otterbox case together there will no NO bubbles at all.I used windex to clean my iphone and otterbox screen.  Worked perfectly on both phones I tried it on.,5
OTTERBOX make the best cases!!1 Only one complaint. I wish the rubber piece could be purchased separately in different colors. I bought this one for a gift. I have one for my Blackberry Q10!,5
"Ordered this for my fiance for his iPhone and he needed a cover bad, so I got him one. He loves it and keeps his phone protected.",5
"I previously had theOtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 3G, 3G S (Black)and it is very similar to this one. If you had the one for 3 or 3G, then you already know how great the OtterBox is. The only issue I have found is that the slot in the rubber for the earphone plug is misaligned. I have to open the rubber flap to insert the earphones.  I also wanted to mention that the hard shell is also easier to open then earlier versions.I recommend this case to anyone who has the iphone 4.",4
I ordered this cover for a coworker  because he liked mine so much.  It is very sturdy and exceeds my expectations.,5
"The Defender is an excellent product and has defended the iPhone from many a disaster. I haven't figured out how to use the holster as a stand, but that's my inadequacy, not OtterBox's.",5
"The best cases I have ever seen, easy, functional, and tough.  They were highly recommended and I see why.  I would not use my phone without one.",5
"You can never go wrong with an otter box, best there is. I love it.",5
"I had a Defender for my recently sold 3GS.  Although the 3GS was almost 3 years old, I received $155 for it thru Gazelle, due in part to the fact that the 3GS looked brand new.  Out of the box, my iPhone 4S was unprotected for about 30 seconds before I slipped on the new iPhone 4 Defender purchased on Amazon.  Because of the case, 4S will also continue to look brand new until I sell it again in the future.  The iPhone 4 case I purchased does fit the 4S, without any problems that I can detect.  The mute switch is tight to reach, but I can do so with my pinky fingernail.  Seldom use the mute so it's not an issue. The inside-back-cover of the case is flocked, mitigating scratching issues.  I have big hands, making the 4S form factor much easier for me to grasp.  The naked 4/4S looks so fragile out of the box, I would never use it unprotected.",5
"I waited anxiously for Otterbox to release this case and ordered mine within minutes of receiving the 'Defender Released' e-mail.  I received the case on Friday and I must admit, it did not disappoint.First impressions:  The case is of great quality and a lot of detail went into making it compatible with all the OEM 'accessories'.  The holster is among the best I've seen for a phone of this size and works perfectly with the case.After carrying it for two days (and this is already my 3rd iPhone 4 case - I am rough on my phones):  The case is without a doubt the most durable I've seen for the iPhone 4 and lives up to the reputation that Otterbox has built over the years.Cons:  The case does add considerable bulk to the phone and may not be perfect for pocket carriers.  It does include a holster which works great and can rotate for vertical or parallel carrying of the phone.Miscellaneous:  I have no complaints really, but I am left to wonder if the silicone 'flaps' that cover the earphone and USB plug-ins could have been a little more user-friendly.  Sometimes they are frustrating to get back into their proper 'closed' position.Edited one month after using:  I am still extremely happy with the case.  I have dropped my phones a few times already and though the case is starting to show signs the abuse I have provided it the phone still looks pristine!  I opened up the case this morning to clean the phone etc and to my surprise there wasn't much to clean.  With cases I've owned in the past I would have a forest of lint, dust etc. that would trap itself between the case and the phone.  The Otterbox has minimized that debris!I am uploading several photos showing the difference between a 'bare' iPhone 4 and an iPhone 4 in the Defender case so everyone can get an idea of how much 'protection' and in turn 'bulk' this case adds to the phone.Edited to add:  Amazon removed my pictures when the placed the phone back in a 'pre-order' status, I will re-upload them again once they allow.  I'm not sure why they state 'pre-order' when it should state 'Back-ordered, will deliver in xx to xx weeks', but I digress.",5
"The Ballistic HC case for the iPhone is the extreme case for the extreme user. Are you a rock climber? A mechanic? A skydiver? Then, this is the case for you!The Ballistic HC is three cases in one. The inner case alone should protect your phone from anything I can think of. It's a hard shell made of shock absorbing polycarbonate and it features a clear, built-in screen protector. No scratches allowed!Next, there's a soft, interchangeable outer gel skin layer that makes it easy to grip and adds even more protection.Finally, there's an optional holster with a 180-degree rotating belt clip. (PS: The belt clip is extremely sturdy - I can't imagine this one falling off or breaking.)As the manufacturer says, this case is 'designed to survive life!'So, if you're looking for an iPhone 4 case that will protect your phone from fingerprints, scratches, dust and almost all drops and bumps, this is the case for you.",5
Different from the iphone 3 case but works really well for my iphone 4. Protecets it from damage and looks great also. My phone still looks brand new. Would recomend to family and friends.,5
"This thing is amazing as far as protecting your phone is concerned. I'm kind of hard on phones, so I was looking for something really substantial. I can't imagine being hard enough on my phone to get through this case, though. The two drawbacks I've seen are either unavoidable or fixable. First, it's REALLY chunky. There's really no way around that, at least not until they invent some kind of miracle material that is also inexpensive. The second problem I had was that the case started screwing up the proximity sensor on my phone. It's next to the ambient light sensor on the front of the phone, top and center. The case has an opening for those sensors (the top most opening) a round one for the camera, and a slit for the ear speaker. The openings for the sensors and phone are covered with a small piece of clear film which I had trouble with collecting lint and dirt. That kept clouding over and causing all sorts of problems. I popped out that bit of film, very easy to do, and haven't had any problems so far.",4
"I received my Otterbox Defender for my iPhone 4 and have been testing it in order to write this review.  I used the Otterbox Defender for my iPhone 3G and loved it.  It provided the kind of protection that I needed for my phone since I was kind of rough on them.  But with the earlier Defender case, I found some issues related to the screen and some of the port covers (mainly the charger port). This new case resolves them all.  I'm happy that the Otterbox company listened and responded with this new design.  It's beautiful, functional, practical -- and for all of the protection it provides from lumps and bumps, it is well worth any extra bulk that you may perceive.For the 3-layered protection that the Otterbox Defender provides for the new iPhone 4, one would expect a lot more bulk.  Not so, it's one of the beautiful things about these cases.  Each layer fits perfectly on top of the other one.  The silicone is engineered to hug every bevel on the plastic inner case.  Both layers give complete access to all of the new button and camera configurations.  So well engineered that you can tell the case was made with thought and complete precision.  You may see knock-offs (as I have), but the real deal is worth the money.There are a couple of things I noticed comparing this new Defender to the former 3G / 3GS Defender case:- the screen protector seems to have been fixed so that the 'oil bubbles' won't appear.  I had the bubbles right out of the box for the former version.  Seems like they fixed something or changed a material or coating.  I'll update if anything to the contrary happens.  No fingerprints on the screen cover either!  How do they do that?- the holster (which I never really use, honestly) makes getting the phone in and out of it a snap (literally).  The holster is good because it doubles as a dock or easel to watch videos, etc.  This new design clips in from the side and can snap in facing front or back with no qualms.  No hard fussing with this one.- the iPhone and case fit easily in a pocket or purse and don't add extra bulk (not like you would imagine).  The silicone is made in such a way where it is not the sticky kind of silicone (the cheaper stuff that smells and has a gripping quality to it).  This has no odor and easily slips out of a pocket (I saw a comment on the other review so I thought I would answer it).- the port for the charger on the new Otterbox Defender can now accommodate non-OEM chargers with wider connectors (the older one could not).  This was a hassle with non-OEM car chargers.  This is no longer a problem.  FIXED.- One potential issue is although I like the patterned back (little etched diamonds), I imagine that these could be a harbinger of dust or dirt.  It's easily cleaned though (just wipe it with a cloth or on your shirt sleeve).  Time will have to tell on this design decision.I'm a fan of the Otterbox and bought one originally because of sheer clumsiness.  For an expensive device like an iPhone, it's worth the protection.  I was initially intimidated from the case thinking it was going to be far too clunky.  Not so.  Like the iPhone 4 the Otterbox Defender iPhone 4 case shares the same aesthetic lines.  If you have never owned a case like this before, installing the iPhone into it might take one look at directions.  If you've used them before, it's the same type of clamshell/snap and silicone slip-on design.It's a tough little case in a nice looking package.  I truly appreciate the precise engineering that goes into the creation of Otterbox products, this company does what they do very well!5 stars!",5
"Otterbox's Defender for iPhone 4 is an armor suit. It may make the phone bulkier, but it will protect it better then any other case. Plus it has belt clip which doubles as a stand. Worth the money.",5
This case really does live up to the advertising.  I just wish otterbox would offer some more colors etc.,5
I cannot live without an otter box !!!!!! I drop my phone often and it is still in perfect condition thanks to the otter box,5
"Bought this case and a Commuter case for two iPhone 4s.  It adds some bulk to the iPhone, but the plastic inner shell fits perfectly and the protective screen does not interfere with the touch screen.  Big bonus, no air bubbles to squeege out!  The silicone outer shell has a snug fit and takes a little work to get on.  Going to replace the Commuter case with another Defender case.",5
"A big, fat, huge, indestructible brick!If that's what you want for your phone; buy it.If that's not what you want, don't buy it.As for me; it's perfect.",5
"This stupid thing is over-engineered! Everything is protected or shrouded by silicone, silicone and polycarbonate, or by the poly window. Being so rugged, it's simply too cumbersome to carry on the belt or in the pocket, so I'm ordering a different case. The case makes the slim iPhone 4 twice as wide, and sitting on your belt it will be an inch and 3/8ths out at a minimum. Carried in the pocket it will be hard to extract because of the grippiness of silicone plus the size.If you need a case that offers drop, splash and frat-house protection, this is it. Only the speakers and mic are exposed, and even those are shrouded by silicone. You get a lot for your money.5 stars for being well designed, minus one star for...being too well designed.",4
"Excellent.  Otterbox case for iPhone4 is a great protector but may be a little bulky for some people's taste.  With phone in Otterbox, it will no longer fit in some docks such as iHome products.  There are available extenders; however, that will solve that problem.  Great transaction and great price.",4
This is a though case. I bought this and started throwing my phone around. My co-workers thought I was crazy for doing it. But then I slowly saw more of them buying some.,5
"I had the Otter box Defender case for my iphone 3G and iphone 3GS and i loved them, so it was only right to get the Defender series for mt Iphone 4.The Good--Doesn't add as much bulk as the iphone 3g/3gs generations-*The Hip holster holds the phone 10 times better and more secure than the 3g/3gs-Accommodates all aftermarket charges, (as another reviewed stated)-New textured backing makes it easier to graspThe Bad (so far)-The rubber casing doesn't seem to be as durable as the 3g/3gsBut allow me to elaborate, i was so happy to get the new case i couldn't wait to drop it. (weird i know)I knew that the last case I had was so durable, I knew I could drop the phone with out any worries. but after dropping it the rubber outside seems to be thinner than the 3g/3gs case. the rubber easily gets cuts where the impact was.All and all the case gets a solid 4 stars because of my past experience with the company. The MAIN upgrade is that the holster hold the phone more securely than the 3g/3gs",4
"I received my OtterBox Defender mid-September. By late October, the hard plastic casing started to fall apart piece by piece. I found this astonishing as I hadn't subjected the product (& my phone) to any type of impact.I addressed these concerns to OtterBox customer service. The OtterBox representative I talked to was very nice and understanding. Said representative sent me a replacement that arrived within three days.Sadly, I do not think the replacement OtterBox will hold up much longer. The plastic casing is beginning to come apart where the back piece slides/locks into the front piece.To summarize: There has to be a defect with some of the iPhone 4 OtterBox Defenders. I have friends that subject their iPhone 4 OtterBox Defenders to loads of abuse yet their OtterBox cases are holding up real well. I suppose I am the lucky one that received two lemons.",3
"This is a great case and another well made case by Otterbox. I use this case specifically for when I'm out snowboarding or if I'm traveling and I need a little extra mental insurance for my phone. I can definitely say this isn't an everyday kind of case as it is quite bulky and heavy too. If you work at a construction site or do a lot of manual labor then this is perfect however for the cubicle commandos out there, this is a bit overkill. Fortunately, I've already dropped my phone in this case even after only having the case for a few hours however, the case and, especially, the phone have held up perfectly. The included holster is nice and the case fits securely in there so no worries about it popping out or accidentally falling out; it actually clicks into place very firmly. If you're in need for a beefy case to protect your dandy new iPhone 4, look no further.",5
"This is a fantastic and durable case!  I love the fact that the screen protector is part of the case, not something that just sticks on the screen.  The rubber edging makes it easy to grip - although sometimes the rubber seems a little loose at times, and I would like it to fit just a tiny bit more snugly.  And I think it is the case that makes a white haze/film over pictures that are taken with a flash, which is a shame.  But not enough for me to want to remove the case.  I put it on the day I got my iPhone 4 (Verizon) and haven't removed it since.  People do say it's bulky, which is true, but I like the extra bulk, and I definitely don't find it too much.  Still there are times I can't find my phone in my purse!!  I haven't had any problems with it impinging on the touch screen at all.  The one app CardStar can't be used with it, but I've heard it can't be used with any screen protector - which is a shame because who in this day and age doesn't have a screen protector???Overall, it has a few minor drawbacks, but not enough for me to give it less than 5 stars.  I love the case and feel so secure having it!!",5
fits iphone like a glove cover fot attachment in right place and easy to get to like this cover a lot screen saver marked easily but better the protective cover than my phone,4
This provides ultimate protection.  I have fallen while jogging... multiple times... and my phone went flying.  The case took a beating (but not bad) and my phone was still perfect.,5
This is our second OtterBoc Defender case.  While it does add some bulk to the phone it also adds premium protection.  The case is extremely tough but still easy to use and access.,5
"I couldn't have asked for more from a case for my iPhone 4.A protective hard shell with a felt interior back entombs the iPhone 4 in a compact design, which leaves all the buttons and switches exposed. It includes a transparent face cover that keeps the iPhone's display from coming in direct contact with fingers, extending the life of the phone's protective surface coating.The silicon wrap brings it all together, enveloping the hard shell in a softer impact-resistant exterior, providing a barrier between the elements and the phone's exposed features, while maintaining the functionality of the buttons. The silicon flaps which cover the charging port, silent switch and headphone jack stay flush in place when they're closed.The holster is easily accessible with easy insertion and removal. A ratcheting belt clip doubles as a stand for hands free, propped-up viewing.This case is awesome. I expect my iPhone 4 will not only be looking like new a couple of years from now, but also will be sufficiently protected from the occasional unexpected bump or short fall which otherwise might cause damage. I am completely satisfied with this product.",5
"I had my otterbox defender for over 3 months and it has been great!! I took it with me on my honeymoon in Mexico and dropped it a bunch of times and never had to worry about it. However there are some drawbacks to it. I have had to make some modifications to my otterbox. First of all the screen protector scratched several times and started to degrade my screen quality so I removed it by popping it out. Luckily I had a new replacement Zagg screen protector that I placed on the phone after I removed the Otterbox screen. So I'm using the Zagg with the otterbox screen protector removed and I noticed that the screen quality is much better now. However the new drawback is that a little dirt can now enter from around the screen but its not big problem because a little dirt always got in anyways. Another drawback is that the bottom back cover that has the missing cloth felt seems to scratch up against the bottom of my iphone 4. So I also added the Zagg cover to the back. It's a tight fit with the Zagg on the front and back and this tends to leave indentations on the Zagg in the areas that the Otterbox is pressing tight against it, but you can't see the indentation unless you take out the iphone. The whole point is to protect the phone so I don't mind messing up the Zagg in the process.The last modification I had to make really gets on my nerves. I started to notice the silicone was getting really loose on my phone. I didn't feel as solid as before. You could feel the plastic hard case move around a lot and the sides of the silicone would come off all the time. I tried to shrink the silicone by putting it in the freezer, this only worked for a few hours then it would expand again. So I rolled up several pieces of regular scotch tape and placed it on the outer back and sides of the plastic hard case to add some bulk to it. Now the silicon fits tighter again and I have extra padding in between the silicon and that plastic incase I drop it again.  I don't like the idea of knowing that I had to use tape to create bulk to the phone. Other than all of these improper modifications that I had to make, the Otterbox still protects my phone and I now have a clearer screen than before and my silicon fits much better than before.",3
Under twenty bucks and free shipping incredible deal.  Make sure you do the baby powder trick to remove oil slick look from screen protector.  Used on AT&T Iphone 4s so had to file down a fraction off the internal case (See Pics).  My buddy has same phone but bought univeral iphone 4 otterbox case and no modification needed.  Case does add bulk but if your looking for a really slick case and have about 80 bucks check out the lifeproof.  I told a female coworker about that one and she bought it.  Real sleek slightly taller but slips into my pant pocket without issues whereas the otterbox gets stuck along the way.  All in all pretty happy maybe if I get a raise will buy the lifeproof.,4
"I got myself an otterbox defender case after I realized that I had smashed my iPhone4's front screen after parking my car and heading towards my home. At that time I wished I had an otterbox case for my iPhone but its never too late. I got a replacement with a new iPhone 4 through the apple store and the next day I placed an order for the otterbox case. Now lets talk something about the case it is great, durable, strong and fits just well. I did not experience any issues or problems so far while speaking or browsing or charging my iPhone. In fact before assembling my iPhone into the case I already and still have a screen guard protector and even after that the browsing and all the functions on my iPhone just work great. I would highly recommend this case to all the iPhone or smart phone users. I am waiting for the new iPhone 5 and without any reservations I am going to get the new otterbox case when its out in the market :-)",5
This is my third otterbox case. I haven't found anything comparable that protects as well as this does. I even have an otterbox case on my iPad.,4
"Although it does what it is suppose to do, keep your phone safe, it just made the phone way too big for my liking.",3
"It is a decent case that will surely protect the phone from a drop.... I'm just not happy that it is not a snug fit! the screen protector does not lay flush. Lint and stuff builds up in the front camera housing and all along the sides of the phone. Also the lint and dirt actually make its way to the phone quite often,I personally don't like having to take the case all apart and clean it like twice a week. Gets annoying!I guess It'll just do for now...",3
"This is what you need to protect your new iPhone.  Most other stores, particularly Apple Stores will charge well over fifty dollars for a similar style.  The Otterbox Defender has a multi-layer of protection, including a clear membrane for protecting against scratches, a hard shell around the phone that splits into two pieces and a silicone outside cover.  The holster clip is tough and durable, but I don't like parading my iPhone around in public.  Even with the case, it fits easily in your pants pocket.  This device is the best protection you can buy for your iPhone 4 or 4S.  Just compare prices.  Considering what you paid for your phone and your monthly service commitment, you don't want to not have this kind if protection.  Apple does provide an annual fee for protection against drops and water now, but it's expensive.  The only drawback is on the top where the headphone jack is located.  The silicone membrane hole is in the wrong place, so you have to open the flap.  Otherwise, I am very happy.",5
"I have been using the Otterbox for a couple of weeks now and I am very happy with it. I work in construction and am often around dust and dirt. I was concerned that the plastic screen protector on this case would scratch and wear out easily. It has proven to be quite good. It does not diminish the great retina view screen image much nor is the tactile touch bad. It is not as transparent as a Zagg Invisible shield, but quite useable non-the-less. I my opinion you do have to tap or touch the screen slightly harder than without the case on. I am very happy with this case and price is not bad compared to other cases or holsters. Five stars so far.",5
"First off, don't buy this in store, buy it online and you'll save 50%. With that out of the way, this is a great case if you're interested in protection. Serious protection! The case is solid and feels great in your hand. If your goal is to keep the same look and form factor of the sleek and sexy iPhone 4, then move on, this isn't for you.My one qualm is that the rubber covers for the headphone jack can be a bit annoying but it's really a small hindrance. I would give it another half star since it came with a belt carrier.",4
"While I didn't own the defender case for the 3G/3GS, I did play with a friend's 3G defender case and I remember thinking I could throw it at a brick wall without damaging the phone. I'm not as confident with the iPhone 4 Defender case.It does provide better protection than any other case I've seen so far, but it still pales in comparison to what the 3G defender provided. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. If this was the first iPhone case ever produced by Otterbox I would probably rate it with 5 stars, but I know Otterbox is capable of doing better. Perhaps they rushed this one into production.The textured back, while cool looking, does turn into somewhat of a dust trap, and you have to either take the case off and wash it off with water, or get a tooth brush (or something similar) to brush all the dust off. The flaps that cover the headphone jack, charger opening, and vibrate switch often come undone. I seem to remember the 3G covers being more like plugs that stayed in place. The defender for the iPhone 4 has these little flaps with a very small and often ineffective tongue & groove system to hold them in place.Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase and the case provides ample protection against casual drops. But as I said earlier, I just don't think it is as protective as the previous defender case was. My friends would often intentionally toss their 3G phones across the room to demonstrate the effectiveness of their Defender case. I'm not as confident in this one.",4
"My preference is to have my phone on my belt, not in my pocket. The problem with most belt carriers is that the case will frequently slip off the belt, particularly after arising from a sitting position, sending the case and iphone ignominiously to the floor. The Defender holster has a lip at the bottom of the belt clip that has largely prevented such suicidal leaps in the month I have owned it.The case does bulk up the slim iphone4, but fits well and seems to provide ample protection. The controls and ports are readily accessible. The touch screen works well through the cover that is integral to the case. The phone fits securely in the holster, but can be quickly removed from it.There are some minor concerns. A little dust has somehow migrated through the openings into the case. There is a hole in the earphone flap, of dubious purpose, that doesn't line up with the earphone receptacle on the phone; even if it were aligned, the thick flap would prevent seating of most plugs. However, simply flipping up the flap provides excellent access to the socket. The flap covering the connector on the bottom of the phone is diffiult to close, and does not appear destined for a long life. The belt clip, of excellent design and function, does not appear particularly sturdy, and may also be foredoomed to a truncated existence. Thus the four star, rather than five star, rating seems appropriate.Overall I am very satisfied, to this point, with the Otterbox Defender for my iphone4.",4
"I have been very pleased with this case so far.  It's definitely going to defend the iPhone 4 against drops, bangs, dirt, dust, etc. It is NOT going to be submersible just by the design.  You do still have access to the ports with rubberized flaps that lightly secure over them when not in use.Yes, this is a protection case, but my biggest surprise was how well the screen still works with the screen protection.  I have bought every brand I've ever seen of screen protectors for iPhone screens over the years and really expected this protection to lower the responsiveness of the screen.  It really didn't.The outside is rubberized enough to give grip, but not so sticky that it won't slide into jeans pockets.If you want some protection for hiking, biking, sports or other work places like construction sites, this would be a great case for all of those purposes.",4
"After seeing a few of my friend's Blackberry and Apple Iphones go to pieces upon dropping them on hard surfaces, I first decided to invest in an Otterbox for my Blackberry and I could not have made a better choice.I recently upgraded to an Iphone 4 for personal use and immediately sought the same protection I have had for my Blackberry, which I use for work. These cases usually come in a 3-piece design and the Otterbox Defender was no exception.The Defender offers a little bulk to the Iphone 4, but it is bulk that I have become accustomed to. One has to consider the investment made on their Iphones, the Iphone 4's alone have a retail value upwards $500.00 and I believe that it should be a 'no brainer' when one considers looking for a case to protect this significant investment.The case like I mentioned is a 3-piece design. The phone is placed in the first two pieces front and back, which literally snap together. The case is then wrapped with a silicone based protective cover, which asks as a gasket over the the two pieces. There is also additional protection by way of the plastic protective screen, which shields the face of your Iphone.The phone is still able to function with absolutely no problem and all controls are accessible. I definitely recommend this case for those concerned with seeking the maximum protection possible for their Iphones.",4
"Good cover, good price. Protects very well. We will see if it streaches out over time like the last one I bought.",5
"First thing first.  I do believe this is the most protection available for an iPhone 4.  That was the reason I waited months for its release and why it is still on my phone.I am disappointed that this one does not match up with the quality of its predecessors.  You can feel the phone slipping inside the plastic case.  The plastic is much thinner and lesser quality compared to the 3GS OB Defender.  I also do not believe that this case could withstand the abuse I have witnessed people putting the 3GS Defender through.Over the last several weeks, I have seen the silicon outer cover begin to buckle around the Home button from lifting the bottom to charge the phone.  The top flap for the head phone jack is also causing buckling at the top of the screen.PROS:1) Solid protection.  I threw it across my office without fear to demonstrate the protection to a coworker considering a case purchase for an iPhone 4.2) The holster is great.  Makes a nice stand for viewing movies in flight.CONS:1) Buckling of the silicon in multiple locations only seems to be getting worse with use.2) Bulky.  Does not fit in a pocket easily with this case on.  Not a huge deal for the protection but worth noting.3) Flaps for charging and headphone jack are difficult to put back in place and get a 'seal'.I got a killer deal on my Defender through Amazon.  Had I paid full retail, I think my review would be a star lower.I really expected more from Otterbox based on previous iterations.  My hope was that by not having the product available when the phone launched that they were really making sure to live up to the legend.  They did not.",3
"When seeing this Otterbox on a buds iphone he told me about the benefits of having it. At first I thought it was too bulky and too heavy to slip in my pocket,and go! I was wrong, its no big deal. I got on Amazon and found it for 20 bucks less than the store price! It came in 4 days and he helped me put it on my phone. And truth be told, I have accidently dropped my phone twice and while others have stressed out about breakage, I just grinned and back in my pocket it went! It's like most anything else we purchase thats 'otter the box' you get used to it!! The fact that I feel like i'm holding on to a phone that won't slip out of my hand when talking is worth it right there! You'll be happy you got it...",5
"I really like this case.  It adds considerable bulk to the phone, but I feel like it is well protected from any mishap.  All of the buttons and ports are easily accessible.  Screen protector is fantastic - you do not even notice it is there.Now my issue - the holster.Main problem - the belt clip.  While the locking belt clip is a good idea when you want to prop it up, I am finding that it inadvertently activates when I am sitting in a chair or getting in and out of the car.  Once it activates, the phone comes right off your belt.  I contacted Otterbox about this and their suggestion was 'You may have better results if you adjust the positioning of where the holster is on your side.'  Come on - that is not really an answer.  I plan to 'break' the tab that holds it open to make sure this does not happen.Second Problem - and maybe not a problem, but the phone is only held in by a single 1' tab.  I am used to a flip top pouch to hold my phone and this thing makes me very nervous.  I am concerned that if brush up against something it will pop out without me knowing.  I do quite a bit of outdoor activities in noisy areas and it would be easy for it to pop out without knowing.",4
"This is my third OtterBox and first Defender.  It is a great product.  However, I ordered a new case and what I received was not new.  It was in a plastic bag.  No box, no literature, no invoices.  It is missing both protective films on front & back windows.  Do NOT purchase from Evelyn Qu.",4
"I never heard of Otterbox until I purchased my iPhone 4 at the local AT&T store where they want a whopping $50.00 for the item. I've shopped on Amazon for several years now, and I knew I could get the Otterbox Defender at a better price. After doing a search on Amazon I found this Otterbox Defender for more than a reasonable price. I now have it protecting my rather expensive iPhone 4 giving me peace of mind if I should ever drop it. The Otterbox Defender makes the iPhone 4 a little larger and it's a little harder to get in and out of the case, (Which I also bought on Amazon) however this is a little thing compared to what it would cost me to replace the iPhone4 if I should ever drop it. Thanks Otterbox!!",5
"This is a beast of a case.  Incredibly thick, I'm sure it will protect the iPhone well.  However, it's far too thick for my taste, and I'll be returning it (the case is double the thickness of the iPhone).",5
I love the way it feels. And it slips easily into my pocket. It was easy to install and looks very good.,5
"I love OtterBox cases. I've already purchased the Defender and the Commuter cases for my iPhone 4. But neither have been as good as the Impact case I had for my previous iPhone 3G, so I was excited to finally get the Impact for my iPhone 4.Unfortunately I was in for disappointment.This case has a loose fit that makes each button press feel weak and mushy.Sure, it provides protection. I imagine that if I dropped the phone, it would make it through just fine. But for actually using the phone, it just doesn't feel like this case was designed well at all, like the Impact 3G was.It's better than nothing, especially considering that it's under ten bucks as I write this. But I'm still searching for the perfect iPhone 4 case.",2
The case fits my iPhone 4 perfectly and covers everything. It doesn't over heat and looks great. The case is durable and is made of a great material.,5
I got this for my husband when he tried to take mine!!!  He really likes it as it is not too thick but fits good in his hand and the phone doesn't slide around in the car.,5
"I have used this cover for a few years and love it. It's tough, and takes a beating. Great value",5
"First of all, the Impact is a great case and worth the money. No question, my iPhone would survive being dropped while wearing this case. In that aspect of the mission, OtterBox has succeeded. Great shock absorption and drop protection.But this case has the same issue practically every other full-body silicone or 'candy-shell' silicone case has: it traps heat like crazy. Your iPhone gets hot while it's charging and warm while doing any serious web stuff or even a long phone conversation.Heat kills.I went back to the bumper because of this--I'm in a two-year commitment with AT&T; with this phone, and I need the battery to last the whole two years. Read the fine print, and you'll see Apple recommends you charge your iPhone out of the case. Why do they do this? Because they know the state-of-the-art li-po battery they make for this phone will die a slow, painful death if subjected to too much heat over a sustained period.They have built circuitry into your phone to stop charging when the batt is topped off, to keep this crucial component safe.I suggest you get a case that has heatsink properties, or has plenty of cooling airflow between the gadget and the case--or remove your iphone for charging.Fatal flaw number 2: this thing is FAT FAT FAT. Now, if that's the look you are going for, more power to ya. I'd rather just use AppleCare as my 'case' and go naked with nothing more than front and back skins than use most of the cases out there. I use the bumper for impact protection, and it has saved my bacon already a couple times. Combined with AppleCare my phone is well protected, and I'm willing to risk AppleCare service to my phone rather than carry this case. IT DOUBLES THE SIZE OF THE PHONE, FOR GOD'S SAKE.If you don't mind carrying twice as much phone as you bargained for, and are willing to remove your phone for charging, this could be the everyday case for you.All that said, I'm keeping this case. I don't need this much protection every day, but at the airport, geocaching, etc. there are situations where the Impact is just fabulous and if you need that kind of occasional protection, this case will get you there!",4
"The case is pretty good, I purchased as a gift and after seeing it in action for a while it's not a bad case after hearing about so many people dropping there phones, I thought to myself this would make a nicve gift for someone who does not want to ruin there Iphone.Its not a bad buy...Well that is all I can say about it the delivery was very fast.. like one day it was here... Pronto!",5
I bought this otterbox case because the defender is too bulky.  I don't like carrying my phone on my belt - and this case is small enough to fit in my pockets.  Only drawback is that the case is rubber - so it pulls my pocket fabric out every time I remove it from my slacks.....  I would recommend also using a screen protector with this case - but it will definitely protect the phone from minor drops or falls.....  This version has better screen access than the one for the 3GS - allows you to type more easily with the phone 'sideways'.  Recommend.,5
"Perfect fit on the iPhone 4.  I like the raised edges on the front so I can lay the phone face down w/o worry.  The material's texture is just right - grippy but not gooey feeling.  Does attract lint, but so does every other soft case. The cutouts are accurately placed.",5
"Great case.  Only 4 mm thicker than Otterbox Commuter, which has a hard plastic shell and seems likely to crack. This will not crack and will survive a fall well.  This is not just a silicone case.  It is reinforced where it needs to be and everything is accessible, even on VERIZON iphone 4.  Proximity sensor appears to work fine.There are 2 drawbacks:1.  It collects lint/dust.  But its easy to wipe off.  The benefit is that it is non-skid so it may not slide out of your pocket or across the table.  This is a plus for the most part.2.  The fit - The case is very snug on the top and bottom.  It could be just a bit tighter on the sides but it is not a problem.  You can pinch the sides of the phone and the silicone will move about 1mm.  Not a big deal.Overall, there is NOT a better case out there for the money that offers drop protection and a screen cover.  It looks good and is not more bulky than most other cases.  This is definitely a winner and I will be returning the Otterbox Commuter, which was uncomfortable and seemed likely to break.",4
The case provides a lot of protection for your phone. Like most rubbery cases it does tend to stick in your pocket.,4
"I got this because I didn't want the defender case and it is considerably cheaper. I really just wanted a silicon case that would protect it from falls. I drop my phone a lot and feel a lot better with this one. The silicon is thick and you have access to all the buttons. Wouldn't recommend spiking your phone into the ground, but on accidental drops I trust it. The screen protector is also nice. I normally wouldn't have used it but it is clear and doesn't make the screen look bad. Gets scratched but I don't care. Does add considerable bulk to the phone but quit complaining, if you don't want to add bulk don't put a case on your phone.5/5 because its not the defender.",5
I love this case! I purchased this one for a friend because we like the one on my phone so much!! It's not. Bulky and it is ease up get to  the arise keys on the keyboard. My only regret is that it only comes on black!!!  Great case other wise!!!!,5
"I have half a dozen iPhone 4 cases. I've been looking for the perfect one for a while now, and I got it with the Otterbox Impact case.Let me start by comparing this case to the wildly popular Otterbox Defender case which I also purchased from Amazon previously. If you want my full review on that case you can click on my username, but let me just compare it to the Impact. The Defender provides more protection however it is a heavier/bulkier case and sports a built-in screen protector. The Defender was too much case for me and I did not like the screen protector. I personally find screen protectors to be unnecessary protection and they make the glass screen of the iPhone slightly grainy.The Impact is perfect because it still offers awesome protection without the bulk. The key feature of the Defender is that the front of the iPhone is covered in silicone on the top and bottom of the screen. This is huge because if you iPhone falls on the ground and lands on the screen side, it has a good chance of not cracking. That silicone on the front is substantial and will save you big time. Most iPhone cases do not feature much protection for the front screen which is so bizarre because if you drop your iPhone screen-first with those cases it is super risky. Not with the Impact case.Silicone is always a superior gripping experience and the iPhone 4 is awesome to hold in this case. Otterbox smartly included these small bumps inside the case where the home button and volume keys are located so when you press those buttons it is so responsive.The only knock on this case is that they should have extended the silicone closer to the sides of the front screen. The Impact weirdly leaves a little room between the side of the screen and the case itself. Essentially it's exposed bezel and it looks and feels unnecessary. Not a huge deal but I do hope Otterbox will make future Impact cases that cover the entire bezel. Even the little parts to the side of the screen.Oh, and the cutout in the back (where the Apple logo is exposed) allows for a great place to rest your index finger when holding the iPhone to your ear or a super spot for your thumb when pulling your iPhone out of your front pocket.Amazing case. Great company. I'll buy future Impact cases for iPhone's in the future if Otterbox makes them.",5
it was a great case it was for my grandsons I phone but he eventually lost it so no more case,4
Great caseReally durable and reliable I throw it for funEvery Iphone i get after this one will be in an otterbox,5
"It surely protects your iphone if fallen from a height. Its bulky but I like it as its not as bulky as the original Otter Box(Hard Case). You can clean it whenever you want as the rubber is flexible. One more good thing is, if your car charger or any other charger is big, it can still fit as the rubber is flexible.The only issue is that, its made of rubber and sometimes it irritates while sliding in or taking out from your jeans. Apart from that, its recommendable.",4
Terribly loose fit. Just got the case and 5 minutes later sent it back! Usless case and really dissapointing coming from Otter,1
After a two week it stopped charging altogether. Nope I'm wouldn't buy it,1
"Wonderful, it was a replacement  it does it's job and was a good price the length was ok also to boast",3
Same as the original. Works fine. No problems so far.Product same as advertised. Price very good.Can recommend this supplier.,5
"This product worked as it was avertised, this product helped with both the distance of charging and connection.  Good product.",5
I'm always wary to get long charging cords because they like to break after two weeks.  I'm happy to say mine are still going strong after three months.,5
"This product worked really well.  It's 6 foot reachability is great!  Reading the other reviews saying that it gave some people a problem SCARED me, but I did not have any issues.  For the price, its unbeatable.  I will definately be getting more :)",5
"I've been using this primarily for car use for about a month. I leave it plugged to charge while my toddler watches movies in the car. It keeps the power fine. But a handful of times in the car and wall, my phone would suddenly say something along the lines of device incompatible to charge. I never had that issue with our iPod or 2 iPhones using the cords that came with them. So far, no complete failures. But I don't think I can fully rely on it if it's already having random unexplained trouble. I hope to though since it's perfect for car use in a big van.",4
This is just what I needed to charge my iPhone 4 - I love the 6' length. Only reason a 4 star is that I wish it would have shipped sooner - that was not clear before placing my order.,4
This extra long cable is exactly as advertised. Now I can keep my iPhone plugged in and it reaches the sofa or the bed. The plugs fit smoothly and is of good quality. And you can't beat the price.,5
"This charger was the perfect length, but after a month of everyday use the coating over the cord started to pull apart at each end. Still working though.",3
Can sit in the chair and charge without having to  lean over the edge of the chair to reach the outlet!,5
This Charger Has Lasted For Almost A Whole Year Without Any Problems. I Do Have A Lifeproof Case & Since You Have To pull The Cord It Did Make my Loss. But It's Still Working.,5
"You would think the charger would last forever and the phone would break before the charger, but in the case the charger didn't take long before it just broke down and didn't work any longer. It no longer charges anything. =^( Very sad because I liked the length of the cord",3
long and very useful.  I will strongly consider purchasing another.  My son uses it often. This should be the standard length provided.,5
"It has been about a month now and still nothing. NOTE: If you're looking for something that will get to you fast, DON'T BUY THIS!!!! I'll update this when I receive it to tell if it works.",1
Looks just like my apple iphone cords except it is twice as long. It is nice having the extra length.,5
This cord fit my iphone perfectly and I love that the cord was longer seems how my night stand is a little further from the outlet and now I can have my phone next to my bed happy customer :),5
"I used this one time and then it stopped working I tried difference outlet and still will not work, Do not purchase",1
"From day one, this charger never worked in my son's iPhone. Not surprised anymore, just fed up with sub par products.DDone buying stuff online.",1
"I have this one in my office so I can charge my  phone at work, I use my phone for the business and I never have to worry about my phone running out of battery",5
i have multiple cords all around the house. i love the length (pause) makes charging my phone (lazy persons way) a breeze any where in the house,5
"Was really hoping this price would get me a quality product; but, alas, it was not to be.Several ordered...some work to charge the iPhone, not worked to charge my iPad. Have already had several fail and one that didn't work the first time it was plugged in.It is a steal...for the seller on this one!",1
"I bought two of these.  They both work and are 6 feet long.  I gave it 4 stars because the first couple of times I plugged in an Ipad2 or my Iphone-4s, it didn't start charging.  Had to unplug and replug it in.",4
The money for this is much bette than the $20 I would have spent at the Apple store for the exact same thing.  I have to buy cables constantly due to my wife and kids rough handling of their stuff.  I bought a dozen of these for less than one at the store.,5
"this product just stop working after only a month or so, sorely disappointed. i guess you get what you pay for.",1
have ordered many of these for the entire family  long length is wonderfull works great and a fraction of apples price,5
"Works well!  Sometimes after market products don't work, but that isn't the case here.  6 ft length is very helpful!",5
"Works great and is well worth the price, I needed the extra length. Giggidy. And it did its job we'll.",5
"I'm no Sherlock, but I'm pretty sure this cord is not an Apple cord.  It was sold as an Apple cord, but I am pretty sure it's a refurbished cord. The connecting parts are apple, but the cord is not.  So far, I'm not having any problems with it.  I like the longer cord since I can now use my iPod on my couch and not have to lean over and get a crick in my neck.  No fire or discombobulating my devise; so over all it's terrific.  I just wish the seller was a little more honest about the referb thing....",4
Very cheaply made and not sure how long it will last but it does charge my phone so I can't complain.,5
I liked the idea of having a longer charger USB cable because my plugs are far but I just couldn't handle the long slow charge It took almost 4x longer to charge then normal. Sorry but I'll stick with the normal 3 foot cable.,2
I bought this cable and it doesn't work. I am planning on returning it ASAP. Save your money and time and go with a more official brand.,1
Iphone cords are so short1 I was excited to find this 6ft cord! Unfortunatly I have purchased several and eventually they always get loose at the base near the plug and stop working. I have purchased quite a few and this has happned each time. My original short cord has never done that. They are so cheap I didnt mind so much.,3
"Well, both work great for my iPhone 4S...neither would charge my iPad, though.  But, I love the lenght, and that I am able to charge my phone with no issues at all...I love being able to move in bed and not be tied right to the wall....I now have a lot more freedom!",4
"I have not had any problems with this cord. Does what it is supposed to do, no complaints. Buy it!",4
hard to connect but a little vasaline and fits great! so nice and cheap! I would recommend this to anyone!,4
"First one they send was wrong, got another package today and the right ones are there.  This is a  great place to get stuff for my phone.  Thank you!",5
"For me, this has been exactly like the original Apple cord, except 6 feet long.  I've had none of the other problems with poor charging or weak connections.  Works great!",5
i loved having the long charger it was so convenient. But after about a month or so of use the charger just stopped working.,3
"The title says it all.  Love the length.  Well made. Durable.  Just doesn't sync.  I did order two and neither sync so I don't think it's a fluke.  Great extra charger.update - March 2014. The original that I ordered is still working. I ordered another one from a different seller and it is DOA, doesn't work at all.So I guess it's a crapshoot.",3
Nice construction.  Not compatible with my iPad 3 like advertised.  The iPhone side of connector broke on my last cable after 1 year of almost daily use.  This should last another year before I get iPhone 5.,5
works perfectly fine. You might think it is cheap unless you play around with it. Its made of great material and its sturdy.,5
"It arrived pretty fast. I read ppl complaining that theirs just sip working and it was poorly mad. However mine was made it seemed and way like the stock apple ones but I guess I was wrong after about month or 2 I plugged it in and 'nothing'. The cable was bad. I made sure to be careful at the ends and like I said it was cosmetically made well to the eye! Im sure I could fix it if I took it a part by why should I have to do that. This item again I should receive a refund or at the very least an exchange, but the seller never acknowledged my request, so I bought two more hopefully not from the same guy.",2
"I love these ones!! So far, I have had it for over two months and it has been great. I'm actually using it right now! I originally purchased a 10' cord from a different seller and that cord didn't even last two days. Wtf. Anyway. I love these ones. They're great because I can do stuff on my phone now while its charging.",5
Always can use a good cord with some length.The ends are firmly set and keep good control of connection.,4
I just got this in the mail a couple days ago. I absolutely love that it is so long! The time it took for shipping was way too long for me but the product is good.,5
great product I love itits extra long and now I can charger it with out worrying it will unplug,5
my mom was complaining that her cord she got with her phone was to short so i got this so she can have a longer cord. she uses it all the time.,5
"It is built ok, it does SYNC and CHARGE my Ipod Touch 4th Gen without any issues.I do see that it's not the best build quality, so it might break soon.It works though, we no noticeable speed difference.",4
This is amazing. Apple cords are always too short and this one is plenty long enough. I wish I had bought this sooner.,5
"This does not work at all. When I connect to my ipohne, it says &#34;Charging is not supported with this accessory&#34;.",1
"These did not cost much but crapped out in less than 2 months.  Garbage.  I guess you get what you pay for, but how hard is it to get these wires correct?  I have had 0 issues with normal USB cables (micro and mini) for android and other devices, yet these knock-off Apple cables are always unreliable.",1
"I realize this was a very inexpensive item, but it fell apart as soon as I used it to charge my phone.  It would be great for the length if it had worked, but you sometimes get what you pay for!",1
This was a great buy for the price. I love the length which allows me to charge my phone and not be subjected to clinging to the wall.,5
"2 bucks?! skeptical at first but this charger is totally 6 ft... i checked :D it works very good! still using it as of today when im lazily on the couch, its perfect",5
I got this in mail with no problems. I really don't have anything bad to say about this. It has been working fine and doing what is it to do!!,4
It's a cable.  That works.  And it's long.  The only drawback is that it literally took a month and a half to arrive via China Post.,4
"I really did not expect this cable to be much... I mean its just a cable.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that the quality of what I received is just as good as the cable you get with your Apple product.  I love that this is sooooo long, and I can lay on my couch comfortably and play on my iPhone 4.",5
I was leary because other people said this broke too quickly. I bought it for my daughter and several months later it's still charging just fine.,5
bought this for quality rather than the cheaper cables out there. its always nice to have a spare one around,3
This is what it is a charger. I think it charges OK.  I bought it for my son and he haven't complained of any problems with it yet.,4
product was very reasonably priced but does not work reliably which becomes very frustrating.  I ended up purchasing an Apple certified charging cable.,3
"This is exactly what I needed and its been working out perfectly for me. The original iPhone charging cords are so short, so this was needed in my apartment.",5
"This is a very good product for the price. It is a little bit of a tight fit in my iPhone 4, but it works.",5
Works just as promised. I like the 6 foot length. Makes it easy to charge and use my phone at the same time.,4
It great to have an extra cord - ability to leave one at work and not have to carry one with you.,5
I love these longer cords.  They are so much more convenient than the short ones that come with the product.  You can actually plug your phone in behind your bed and still have plenty of cord to charge overnight.  Also great if your computer tower isn't on the floor or not right at your desk.  I've bought several of these to share with my kids and grandkids.  They work great!,5
We plug these in behind our bed's headboard and string them to our bedside tables. These are long enough that you can lie in bed reading/playing a game and still have it plugged in. We also have one plugged into the car's charger (in the dashboard) and I'm pretty sure it could reach the back seat!,5
no issues with this product came early than expected have everywhere rather than moving also great to keep plugged into computer for iPhone downloads keeps more space for memory for iphone,5
"It does charge my iPhone, my kids' iPods, and will charge my iPad very slowly but only if I'm not using it. My iPad will still continue to use up the battery if I use it while it is plugged in. I see in the description that the iPad is omitted for use with this charger. Kind of disappointed but I only paid around $4 (1 apiece, and $3.50 in P&H) for them so, I got what I paid for.",3
"We didn't have it very long before the cord stopped charging the ipad.  Although I am sure my kids were kinda rough with it, I did expect it to last more than a week or so before being done.  the price is great, but not that durable.",3
DO NOT BUY....this cord did NOT charge my phone. when I plugged it in it just kept my phone from dying any more than it already was. It just kept it at the same charge percent but did not actually charge the phone.,1
"This cord works well I have not had any problems out of , it charge my iPad good so that great .i like that ,so that's good",5
"Exactly as described. I like the fact that is longer than the one I had before. Really good quality. Shipped on time, thank you.",5
"I use this cord to charge my iphone at night so i can keep my phone on my bed. The cord works perfectly for my iphone.I have tried to use it a few times with my ipad and i noticed it didn't really work. But i bought this cord to work with my iphone, so i am not terribly concerned about it.",5
I read reviews all day before I finale splurged my few dollars and guess what?? They are AWESOME!! I bought 2 and both work great for my husband and my iPhones 4 we have had them for months now and they are the only ones we use never had a problem the cord is nice and long so I can comfortable charge phone while I use it laying on te couch not squatting next to a wall like we had to do with the short cords!!,5
"Why are cell phone cords so damn short?! This one is long, so I don't have to hug the wall when I take a call or text.",5
"For the price it's amazing. The cord is really long and charges the phone just like all other cords. I would order this again. Shipping took forever, but what do you expect for less than $2?",5
"JUNK JUNK JUNK!! Do not buy this cord because it will not last at all. I made the mistake of bringing this on a trip, and it FAILED on me. Right when I needed it the most! The wires near the adapter part somehow broke so it was not connecting to charge my iPhone at all. So I had to rush out and buy a new adapter cord in order to charge my phone.SO FRUSTRATING & pain.",1
the product was exactly as described in the information. Works perfectly for my Iphone4S and long enough for my outlet that is too far away.,5
I like that the cord is long but the part that plugs into my phone got stuck in my phone and completely broke off. Obviously it's a low price but it should break the first time I use it. I bought two and they both broke. And it took a really long time to get to me.,1
Works just fine. I love the long length of the cord. This allows me to play games or read from practically any location that's within 5 feet or so of an outlet.,4
Looked fine. Worked fine ... for 3 charges.  On the 4th it says says &#34;not compatible&#34;.  Would not recommend from this buyer.,1
i needed one longer and they had it and im happy to have gotten it already every thing was good ty.,4
Love this! Now I can lay in the bed comfortably and use my phone while it's charging instead of leaning over the bed with the shorter cords!,5
"I like this product for the length. Although, it does take much longer to charge my phone. But, that's what i expected since it's not really an apple brand. It's more of a knock off. But, it still gets the job done!",4
As you know iphone/ipod cables are very short...This item allowed me to charge my apple products without worry of them being pulled off a table because of a short cord. Charges just as fast as a short cables...,5
"I loved having a 6' sync cable for the time I did have it. However be aware that the 3rd generation iPad will not charge with it. Also, the plastic sheath that slides down on the USB side of the cable has come apart from one of mine. They are so cheap though, that I really didn't expect it to work even as well as it did, for as long as it did... I purchased 4, because I like extras and because they are cheap. However, they won't really do much for me now except as a sync cable (or to charge my iPhone, which is almost never) rather than a charging one for the iPad. Also, these, unlike many others I purchased on Amazon over the years, are identical to the Apple branded ones, as the connectors have sharp lines on both the 30-pin side and the USB side.",4
"The cord easily starts to pull apart and eventually it stops working. I put electrical tape on it but it doesn't hold too well. But for a while, it worked great.",3
love these,5
This fell apart within a week after ordering it. The price was too good to be true. Don't waste your $$. Amazon should not offer this and degrade themselves.,1
"It's long, it works, its not difficult and it reaches across my bed so I don't accidentally pull the chord out of the wall!",5
"I hate the short Apple cord and hoped this would be a good solution. It charged my iPhone 4s, but in less than a week, the piece that plugs into the phone (pins) separted from the white base and I didn't want to risk trying to use it after it basically fell apart.",1
"I bought this for my sister since her last one broke. I think it might be more than 6ft though haha. It stretches really far so you wouldn't need an extension cord if your plug is far from where you want to charge your device. Overall, this cable charges great and is inexpensive (:",5
I bought it for a friend and he loves it.  He needed something for his car  and this was the perfect gift.,5
"The first two weeks I had it I would give it 5 stars for price, arrived early and the product quality but it now does not charge my device at all. It says it isn't supported (I use an iPhone and iPod) disappointed now",3
I ordered the iPhone 5 one but someone got the iPhone 4 cord. It took 29 days to get here which isn't bad it said it took a long time. So I have no clue if this works or not. Rather disappointed,3
Didn't even work when I received it. Plugged it into the wall and my phone and no charging was happening. I was really excited to get it too.,1
This cord is nice for the length but will not charge our phones. Big waste of money for this purchase,2
It's hard to rate this item because I still have not got it yet. :-( I do not know what the hangup is.,1
The plug is weak. Didn't last long before the plug started falling apart. Not happy with it. If you can make your own I would recommend doing so.,3
the length of the cable came in very much handy! it looks pretty cheap though..but haven't had no problem with it. so i recommend it anybody.,3
"It lasted for a little while, but it broke along with the rest. Im just going to try the flat cords instead",2
I love the length of the cord. I can actually do more when my iPad is charging.  Good for the price.,4
This is a fabulous product because the iPhone was made in China where these cords originate from and they fit the iPhone perfectly and tight.  I recently bought a new case that I really love for my iPhone and I could not get a cord to fit in the new case in order to charge my phone except the original cord it came with.  I like to have a cord with me at all times as I carry a charger and I can now use this new cord and not worry about the cord not fitting.,5
Worked great for my sisters phone but it just stopped working out of nowhere it did last long and came fast,4
"The USB tip end on this cable is actually a little longer than the standard Apple USB cable connector; so the cable does not insert all the way into wall jacks or car jacks for charging, this causes the carging time to be extended and so your phone does not charge as quickly. It might be because of the length of the cord (6ft) but I think it has something to do with the USB tip end not inserting all the way in....",2
I need to replace several cords because they didn't last as long as I thought they would.This was worth it.,5
Should have bought this cord 2 yrs ago when I first bought my iPhone 4. The pre packaged cord is a joke. Have been using this cord daily on my phone and ipad with no complaints. Guess it will be obsolete for me if I upgrade to the iPhone 5,5
This cable was hard to find in the usual stores so I searched for it on Amazon and found it right away at a great price.,5
"It works and everything, but not exactly 6 feet. It doesnt really reach me in my bed which is annoying. But I guess thats my fault. It works and yeah lol",4
They're longer than any sync cable I've played with and that keeps them from being tugged unduly.  They work well and the price point is unbeatable.  Shipping was something like 8 days when they arrived.  A must if you sync your ipod and leave it on the desk.,5
"I've purchased more than a few of these. They all worked flawlessly on my iPhone 4. They charge up quick, quality products and durable. I've traveled with them everywhere.",5
This cable was just fine thank you so much for getting it to me on time and for such a good price.,5
its a cord and i use it for all my ipod/ iphone needs it works well and the price is right to.,5
"I can never get too many cables.  They either break or are lost, misplaced at someone elses house, etc.  I don't worry about it now that I have so many!!!!!",4
This cord seemed like a deal and got good reviews.  There's a reason it's only 1.73.  I had it about one week before it stopped charging.  It came u.s. mail from china.  Terrible purchase.  Spend an extra buck or two and get a better one.,1
I don't really understand why most of the Apple chargers are so short.  This one is long enough to reach from a floor outlet into someone's lap while they use the device.,5
"This cable charges my phone, but doesn't sync with iTunes. However, the Mac seems to see the iPhone, according to System Profiler. But I don't have this problem with other cables.",2
So much longer than the normal iPhone charger! Is ideal for connecting semi far away. I would definitely recommend it!,5
Best investment I have ever made in my life -:) I am so happy with this I have ordered 2 more so I don't have to take this one from room to room,5
Bought two of these! Great cables for a cheap price. They definitely break and stop working a lot quicker than an apple cable but for how cheap they are it's worth it.,5
"Works great/perfectly, is really DEFINITELY long enough (6ft.), and is hassle-free for an ipod touch charge cable :) Also, works great for the 4th ipod touch ;)",5
Works as well as any other charger. No complaints from me,4
"I read a lot of negative comments about the longer cables compared to the standard apple length, I haven't had any of the issues people have listed.  I've used mine with my laptop on it's usb2 / e-sata always on port to charge my iPhone4 and to sync it, as well as to install a firmware update on it, and everything worked flawlessly.  I've also used it with my desktop pc to sync music onto my iPod classic 160gb, connected to a USB 2.0 hub plugged into one of the ports on the front of my case (my only complaint about my Antec Nine-Hundred case being that it only has 2 USB ports on the front of it) and I haven't had any connection issues,  errors or loss of speed.  I actually took the time to compare adding 1gb of music to my iPod with a stock 3 foot apple cable and then deleted the music and added the same data back onto it with the 6 foot cable...the time was just about the same, I think it was 17 seconds faster with the longer cord, but I'm sure it was due to system memory use being different or core use on my intel quad being lower.  I also saw complaints about the cable being flimsy and breaking easily, but I can't see any difference compared to the apple brand cord that came with my iPhone.  Overall, I find this cable to be an excellent product at a fantastic price.",5
Check a neat little device called portapow  it measures the amp draw from your device. So I checked these and it's almost half the amps as the OEM cable.,2
This charger worked exactly as it should have. It was like a new apple brand charger. Good price and you can't have enough usb cords.,5
"Already sent one review 2-3 weeks ago... But will confirmed it again: I like the link, received it before scheduled time and it's still working and hope it will continue to charge my iPhone 4! Thanks!!!",5
"This product won't work on an iPhone 5s. I could use aftermarket plugs on anything below a 5. These after market charging cables don't comply with iphone5s models. When plugged in, phone displays a message &#34;this accessory not supported.&#34;",1
I loved the length of the cord.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family and purchase more for gift giving..,5
"Doesn't charge well, and was already split and torn up after 3 weeks... do not buy!!! Get the Amazon one for a few dollars more.",1
Worked just like intended and I absolutely love how long it is. That is one thing I hate about most chargers they are far to short!,4
"good cable. did the job. but as it was priced very low, it was expected to be malfunctioning after a couple of months. which it was. but still worth it.",3
"Recently received the new cable.  It seemed to be OK at first, but after about three weeks the 3Gs iphone keeps popping up an error message saying this accessory won't charge the phone.  Don't know if the connector has gone bad, if it's not making full contact any more once plugged in, or something in the new 4.34 firmware upgrade recently installed is causing the issue.  Connector does not plug into the phone as well as my previous 6 ft. cable.",3
This was perfect for connecting my mid-2010 Apple MacBook Pro to our Sony Bravia HD Television.  Nice quality cable and the white color identifies it as an Apple accessory at our house.,5
"TO BE REAL I DON,T EVEN REMEMBERING ORDERING THIS ITEM I MIGHT HAVE BUT I DON,T REMEMBER SO GUESS IF YOU NEED  IT WOULD WORK JUST FINE",5
"As soon as this came in the mail, I was excited to use it. It is really long. I was annoyed using the short charger that comes with the iPhone. This is worth the buy. I make sure I have this charger with me everywhere I go.",5
I use it to charge my phone and iPad and it works great. So far haven't had any problems. :),5
"Works fine. Should have ordered more!  I use it in my bed room, it's perfect for when I'm playing with my iPad at night!",5
I don't know if it was my fault or what. I was looking for one for a 5 some how got it for the others. I re sold one an my roommate used the other. It took forever to come though.,1
Works as advertised for my iPhone 4S but it does not work for my first generation iPad.The extra length is quite handy,3
"I loved this cord for my iPhone4! I love the extra length so you don't have to sit so close to a wall outlet while charging. I have since upgraded to an iPhone5 and have to get new cords, but this one worked great. It fit right into the plug just perfect and charged/synced like it was supposed to. Definitely a good buy!",5
I purchase this for my iPad.  Simetime I get a reading that say not charging or not recognize.  I have to keep taking the cord out and putting it back in.  I don't know if it has a shortage or not. Maybe it not the right cord for the iPad.???,3
"I bought this to replace the cable for my wife's dilapidated apple cable for her iPad 2.  Hooked it up overnight and only got to 10% charged.  My son tried it for an iPhone 3G and it didn't charge at all.  Another cheap, non-working piece of junk.  I think I'll believe the negative reviews on products priced too good to be true.",1
"This is perfect item, it is much better than the standard cord that comes with a phone or IPod. Worth every penny. Little longer than normal shipping but it is coming from overseas.",5
This 6ft cord was exactly what I needed. Now I don't have to use extension cords to charge my phone. It got here fast and I was able to use it quickly.,5
bought two of these and both broke within about 6 months.  They are not as good as factory and the old short ones work for years,1
"I bought this well over 6 months ago. I do not have it anymore , but for what i paid for it it was a great buy. I love the extra feet.",5
I should have known better than to buy this. It was cheap and you get what you pay for. Doesn't work.,1
What can I say.  Its a cable its 6ft. long and it works for both sync and charge.  Took a while to get here from overseas but I knew that and shipping was free.  Cable is flexible and seems to have OK strain relief on both ends.  Time will tell if it will hold up.,5
good cables s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s sssssssssssssssssssss sssssssssssssss sssssssssssssss sssssssssssss sssss,4
"This cord is not for iPad 3, the chip in the connector is not compatible with iPod 4 and iPad 3. Please ask seller to verify information before place your order.Im using this cord to charge my iPhone 4s while I was sleeping ONLY.",2
I did give this 4 stars mainly for the price. I ordered 3 of these and only two worked. For the price I can live with that. Buy at your own risk.,4
"Love the 6 foot iPhone charger cord when setting around and your iPhone needs to be charged, You can use it and not worry about pulling it out of the wall. Thanks for a great product.",5
"The cords that come with the iPhone and the iPad are just way too short, so the length of this cord is perfect.",5
"This product is a good length but after a month or so it stops working. I buy many iPhone chargers on-line and when I do it, it seems like a great idea because it is so cheap. However, they always end up breaking!",2
Does extactly what you need it to do. Looks just like the original Apple cable except the length actually makes it usable.Lost one star for taking 10 years to get here.,4
the cord is exactly what i was looking for & perfect length. it was a pain having such a short cord that only reached the end of my bed so i can say this cord is a winner just took so long to come in i understand its from overseas but a month to ship is way to long,5
I have not had any problems with this piece other than its not apple certified and your iphone will tell you.  What a crook.  But it works just fine!,5
"Fosmon Extra Long 6 Foot (6ft) Apple iPhone / iPod Charge and Sync Cable,...great price for this product. Love that it is longer than the normal cable",5
i accidentally bought this for my brother for his ipod but ugh... It ended up for my mom :-C Lol but it's cool.,5
Item as described. Works...,4
"I do not reccomend this. It stopped working after 2 weeks, Very frustrating. Do not buy. I wish there was a charger that actually lasts",2
"This works just as advertised and was shipped even earlier than was estimated which was a pleasant surprise!  It's SO nice to have a long cord when my phone is charging up, so that I can use it without needing to be up against the wall! ;)",5
The extra length does wonders for my iPhone.  I wonder why they have not made this the normal length of an iPhone cable.  I love it.,4
"These allow you to keep the phone charged and conveniently use your iPhone while it's plugged in. Apple should make the cords this long. I got one for the living room, one for the bedroom and one for work, the short one for the car,  and now my phone is always fully charged when I put it in my pocket.",5
This was the perfect length and was exactly what I was looking for...Charges my phone just fine and I don't have any complaints so far...,5
I am completely pleased with this cable. I like the fact that the cable is long enough so that I can sit on the couch or lie in the bed and still use my ipod while it is on the charger. Great item. I would reccommed.,5
"I've been using this cord for a few months now, and it's still working great.  Charge my iPhone 4S, my iPad 2, and my friend's iPhone 5s.  Cat even chewed it in a few spots and it's still working.  I ordered another a few days ago (Shipping takes awhile) just incase for some reason I lose\break this one.",5
Really good cable and worth buying. Works well in office where the charger points are far away..or in toilet as well. Charges with super cool speed.,5
"It broke the 3rd time I used it, and I am gentle with these things. It wasn't stretched either, piece of junk",1
"It took a really long time to receive this cable and once it arrived, my son discovered it doesn't work as intended. The cable is double the length of a normal one, but he can't plug it in his phone completely to get a charge. He has to stick in about halfway in order for it to charge.",1
"This is a great product. The cord is long, thick and durable. Works well and I would definitely buy this product again in the future.",5
I am just saying that don't expect this to last as long as the real Apple cords but both cords worked for me and it is other than that as described.  But the life span is way less than the real thing but..... its all so 1/3 the price so I was happy in the end!!!,4
"It is working on second gen iPod, iPhone4 and iPad2.  Yes it charges and transfers data.  It is a bit slower than the original cables that came from apple.  4 stars just because it took almost 3 weeks to arrive from Hong Kong",4
"was not aware that i bought two cords, but hey you can never go wrong with a longer cord for yout ipod/iphone i love this item because it allows me to be away from the wall/outlet while charging and using my phone at the same time, wish is came in other colors, but over all it serves its purpose",5
The length is great but the cords don't fit my phone very well.  They're not the size of the original apple cords and so they won't fit into the case I ordered of the COCO FUN (lifeproof)  I had to file the hard plastic down around the plug.  I ordered 6 of these so was a little more work than I had expected.,2
Easy to use phone while plugged into wall. You don't have sit right on top of outlet. A nice item to have.,5
The best USB cable i have purchase yet. I get lots of things done with this long cable and its just very nice. Thank you so much!,5
okay i was super excited when i got this because the price was super cheap and i have been needing a long cord because the smalls ones are annoying and confine you to a small space around the outlet. i was happy but now it wont charge my phone anymore and i'm pretty sure it broken after less than a weak which means ill have to order another one. i think it was just made cheaply because i was careful with it. oh well.,3
This cable won't charge and won't transfer files. It is basically better off used as a shoelace if apple Ever produces a foot wear line. Waste of time and money,1
"I purchase three of these and within 2nd use, the part which fits into the device to charge BROKE.  It's made poorly and literally broke apart after one use.",1
APPLE'S PROPRIETARY CABLES SUCK IN GENERAL DUE TO COST.  THIS WORKS FINE.  PLEASE MAKE THE SPECIAL CORD FOR THE NEWER APPLE PRODUCTS.,4
"I have to admit I was a bit sketchy when I purchased this item. I've only had it for 3 days and so far so good, this charger cable works perfectly! It charges my Iphone 4S very fast its even better than the original apple cable that it came with. I will be purchasing another one for sure! Thank you. Oh and it took a bit longer to ship than expected but it was worth the wait.",5
i knew this going in . i have no problem paying a dollar for a cord to possibly break than 20 dollars and the cord break .. I actually have only recent;ly been having problems with these cords and sometimes not charging. But its a dollar cord lol dont expect more than what u paid,3
My girlfriend was all the time talking on the phone and all the time looking like she was listening to the wall. So I got her a six foot cable to charge her iphone with. Now she sits up straight and can even stand while talking on the phone and charging the battery.,5
THIS IS A MUST HAVE ! MOST DEFINITELY WORTH IT ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE IT WAS SOLD AT! AND IT ALSO CAM EON TIME (:,5
Love the long cord for the I Phone. Very pleased with this item. Now that is all that I have to say.,5
I would recommend staying away from these generic Lightning cables and paying more for approved cables. You will be happier in the long run.,3
"i bought 5 at one timeabout 3 of 5 worked consistently2 of them never worked from the start, which wasn't a big surprise given the price and allgenerally satisfied. wish there was a better proportion that worked",3
"one of the best purchases i've made for my apple device. That extra length is awesome for when u want to lay in bed but and have the cord extend all the way to you. The seller actually contacts you to see fi you've received your product. very nice of them to do that, that shows they genuinely care for their customers. 10 stars!!!!",5
"My family is very hard on cables.  These cables were nice and long, but just couldn't handle being moved around a lot, and died within a few weeks of purchase.",3
I am very happy with this iPhone cord.  It arrived before I was expecting it and it's great not to have to be right up against the wall if I need to be plugged in and using the phone.  It gives me more room and I love it.,4
"The first cord failed about 2 weeks after I received it. Looked OK, but would not charge nor sync.  Got a 2nd and it's worked so far.Because of the first failure, I can't rate it any higher than I have.",3
This was part of the battery package so you can connect the iPhone 4 to the unit.  It is long enough.,4
"THIS FITS MY PHONE VERY WELL AND IS TO USE. THE CORD IS LONG ENOUGH AND DID NOT CURL UP,IT IS EASY TO UNINSTALL IF NEEDED.",4
"This cord is AWESOME. I'm so happy I got it.  It appears to be the same quality as any apple product.  It's twice as long and the regular cord, charges my iphone at the exact same speed as the OEM one and synchs with my computer just fine.  Apple should really include longer cords with their products, but in the meantime, this one for 2.50 is great.",5
"The product both syncs and charges my Ipod touch 4G. It's just as durable as the ones made by apple and is so much less expensive. It's exactly what you came to this page looking for, buy it. I'm about to purchase a second one right now.",5
"Its Okay..It shipped very fast, Thanks! Went on very easy. All six came. But the problem is that its pixelated and blurry. It gets oily very easy. I can still see but it gets annoying.",3
These screens work good with the IPhone 3gs.  There is nothing more to say but they require this many words for the review.,4
"Great protectors for this price! Easy to put on, works great! Glad I ordered them! Came pretty quickly, you can't go wrong here!",5
"This item seems to be shipped directly from chin, which somewhat effects its delivery time...Usually, it's a pain in a neck to apply these screen protectors, but these appear to be slightly thicker than usual, and that makes an application process a bit easier.One would still need to get rid of air bubbles though...It doesn't seem to effect touchscreen sensitivity all that much neither. Overall, not bad for the money...",5
Fast shipping...great price for excellent screen shield protector for the device.... Highly recommend this product to anyone who uses iphone 4,5
"They work great, I have only had to use one so far and has not started to peel. feels very soft.",5
These covers were hard to find. The 3G isn't as popular as it used to be so accessories are few.,4
"I bought a 6 pack of screen protectors because I usually get bubbles (from stowaway lint) and end up using 3 before 1 sticks without any problems. With a phone cover on, however, the edges of the screen protector have been peeling off. Luckily, I have 3 more protectors..",4
I love these screen protectors.When you use these it eliminates having to constantly wipe fingerprints off your iphone.Excellent service also.,5
I have purchased these screen protectors in retail packaging before at a much higher price.  These came in bulk packaging but appear to be identical to the retail packaged screens.  Can't beat the price and full quality at the same time.,5
my sister loves the screen covers because she scratches her screen a lot and this really saves her phone big time.,5
"This is a good investment if you'd like your phone's screen to last. Cheap, easy to put on, and strong.",5
"I purchased two sets of these screen protectors and very happy that I did! I messed up the first one. But, I got the second to go on fine. now I have enough screen protectors to last me a year. So, I'm good!",5
I decided to keep my iphone and make sure the screen is protected because I have not upgraded to the newest iphone. These screen protector works great and fits my needs.,5
Very convenient way to protect your screen and very affordable. I have had my Iphone for 3 years and it still looks brand new!,5
"The silicone fits the iPhone well, however it is quite difficult to get out of the pocket sometimes due to this. It also becomes quite dusty, and needs to be cleaned often. Doesn't provide a lot of protection but is decent for someone who doesn't get out much.",3
"Pretty good quality silicone. Not a sticky silicone like I was expecting at the price. Has discolored over time, but still worth the money.",3
This was a belated Christmas gift.I was very pleased with the quality of this item.Highly recommend.Ref. Birugear Clear Soft Rubber Silicone Skin Cover Case for Apple iPhone 4sHave a spectacular day,5
"i rate this casea 6 out of 10, looks just like the pictures but the material is very thin and flimpsey.",3
"Nice looking but loose, U can not put it in UR pocket it will come off, not the perfect one .",3
"SEEMS TO WORKS AND FIT MY BLUE TOOTH EAR PHONE. CHEAPER THAN REPLACING THE BLUE TOOTH, GLAD IT WAS AVAILABLE.",5
"The fact that these are available to purchase is great. Unfortunately, I ordered this set first and it did not fit my style of bluetooth and I am giving the customer service the 5 star rating for assisting me with my dilemma.  Thanks for everything.",5
There is not much to say. the product meets the description and it is priced well. The product arrived on time and does the job. So if you need this item get it!,5
These broke when I tried to place them around my ear.  They are too weak with thin plastic and too small for the phone.  Sorry but I have to say the truth. :(,1
"These are good but they're not as great as the original ones that come with the headset. These just keeps the headset in place but doesn't have that tight fit the Samsung ones had. But Does a great job keeping the headset on your ear, just not as a good job keeping the headset in your ear.",3
"Works As good as expected, really comfortable, I would purchase again.and would also recommend to anyone that Is looking for a product like this.",5
"more durable than the original ear hooks from Samsung, which are crap.  i dropped my earpiece from 3 ft and the clip snapped in half.  BOOOO Samsung!  99% of the things you make dont last... kinda like a money grab. Thank goodness there are aftermarket people who make replacement parts.",5
"An excellent replacement for my lost ear hook. Fits over the ear comfortably, holds the Samsung securely just like the original did.",5
"These are very similar if not identical to the ear hooks that come with the head set, however, they are too rigid and tend to crack where it connects to the head set. I would recommend the black ear hooks that are more flexible and last longer.",2
too flimsy and they are built to fit only very narrow blue tooths  definitely forget buying these unless you have the right sized blue tooth.,1
I bought these for my sisters Bluetooth and she was so happy when she seen how many she got and I paid so little. W,5
They are the only ones I can use on my ear place and I need them for my work . Thank you I wish it was metal,4
This is not the cheap plastic piece that came with the ear piece. These things are thick and solid. They grip good too!,4
we just receive our cases in the mail and they came much much faster then they said. we love the cases and have no complaints we couldn't wait to pick out a color and put it on. they fit perfect with all the cut outs and material is nice soft and smooth! great buy and perfect price!,5
All the cases where nice. They fit good on my HTC evo 4g and when I dropped my phone it wasn't scratched at all. So yes I would recommend this item. This is really cheap considering if you go to the Sprint store they want $17-$19 dollars for just one of these black.k silicone cases.,5
I love all the colors.  They are a great bumper for your phone when you dont want a bulky case on your phone.,5
Worked great and gave me a option at choosing a cover to match my clothing for the day. If your into accessories matching buy these covers.,4
"These colors are spot on. Received them super quickly too. They aren't a super snug fit, but will do considering the price.",3
"**Update 8/29/11**Obsolete now but had to add that I loved my DX until I replaced it with the DX2 which should be a better phone than it is but it's still very good.This phone rocks. That sums it up pretty nicely. I was a Blackberry Curve owner and I loved my BB. Still love my BB but the Droid X is so very cool and does so much I'm always doing something with it. As a matter of fact, besides being bigger than a BB, the only complaint I have is that I am not getting as much done these days since getting my DX a week ago.I'll have to come back and update this in a month. I'm sure that with some time the new will wear off and I will have more to say.Bottom line: This is an excellent phone that has unlimited potential via app's to organize and simplify your entire life. The only problem is that it can actually cut your productivity if you allow it. With a little self-discipline, however, there is no end to the amount of helpful functionality this phone can deliver.I would like to see a better music player even though DoubleTwist works well enough it could be more user friendly.I would also like to see some desktop software to more easily sync it with my pc.I would recommend this phone to anyone but I'll wait a while beyond doing it here because I'm enjoying being one of the first to have one. It's fun to show off. ;-)",5
"I have owned this phone and a few other android phones over the last couple years and let me just say this one was quite a bit of a let down.  Let me start with whats good.  It looks great, and feels solid in the hand.Now onto the bad.  Motorola decided to yuck this up with their terrible Moto Blur skin.  What that means is that user interface looks ugly, and it does a bad job of adding to the stock android experience.  Next lets move onto Verizon's slow as molasses 3g speeds. In a nutshell, verizon has the slowest 3g data speeds of all major carriers in the US.  What this means is that AT&T; and T-mobile 3G phones can download and stream videos  nearly 4 to 5 times faster.  I know because I also have a t-mobile account and that 3g phone always beats this one in bandwidth tests. 1.5Mb's on Verizon vs 5.5Mb on T-Mobile.  Needless to say it's a huge difference.Also gaming stinks on this phone.  The TiOmap cpu/gpu that motorola used in this phone is very cheap compared to the CPU/GPU that Samsung uses in their Galaxy S phones.  At best, performace wise this phone barely has as much horse power as HTC's Nexus one which was released well over a year ago.So there you go.  Save your money and buy either a newer HTC phone like the thunderbolt (at least it has an LTE radio), or save up for the new Samsung Galaxy S II phones that samsung just announced.  Engadget said it was the best smartphone they have EVER tested.  Eat that iphone.  Currently Motorola's android phones all stink compared to Samsung, and HTC's best.Compared to the iPhone:  There's no comparison, the iPhone blows this hunk of junk away.  Anyone who says otherwise is simply in denial, and has never used an iphone.  The Droid X is for people who want a free smartphone, simply to get their feet wet.  This is in no way a powerhouse of a phone, and it's very buggy.  I'm a huge android, and have supported it from day one with my old T-mobile g1.  But sadly the Droid-X is all bark and no bite.",3
"Over a six month period, I had three of these phones - 2 Droid Xs and a Droid X2.  Each time, the phone would die.  The first time, I was on a call and the screen went black, would not come back on and would not end the call.  I had to pull the battery.  The replacement and the next two would freeze during video recording, the screen would pixelate, the picture would turn sideways and the phone would shut off.  Verizon was no help whatsoever.  It was so bad, I cancelled my contract, paid the $300 to get out and went to Sprint and an iPhone 4s, where I had no problems.",1
"Motorola DROID X Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)I had been holding out for the iPhone, but had refused to move over to AT&T; from my Verizon service, which I have been totally satisfied with these past 6 years or so. When the DROID-X was announced, I began reading the reviews and looking over the specs. The more I read, the more impressed I became.However, most of the reviews trashed the operating system, Android 2.1, so I keep looking, reading, and doing nothing. As luck would have it, my old Verizon phone, the LG Versa, got its windshield cracked and I was unable to view the display. So it was time to act. I had talked the talk, now I needed to walk the walk.The Verizon people spent a lot of time with me discussing the plans and options, features of the phone, etc. So I gave them a few hundred bucks and ordered the DROID-X. The first good surprise was it came in a week early.  As part of the 'package' I purchased the leather carrying case, the Multimedia docking station, and the 32GB SD Card upgrade.Size MattersNow I had read that the graphic display was not as good as the iPhone, but in reality, it is wonderful. The larger size (4.3') screen is impressive and the virtual keyboard fits my fat fingers perfectly. The touch screen is at least as good as the iPhone (and iPod Touch which I previously owned). Being slightly larger, everything appears brighter to me than the iPhone, I don't see how the resolution could be any better than the 480x854 resolution (the iPhone is 960x640 and the screen size is 3.5' so obviously the resolution is better, but I cannot see it). For those apps that support it, the display can be either portrait or landscape. It takes about a second to change over. While the Droid-X is notable larger than the iPhone (and I believe almost any other phone on the market today), it is not heavy. I did a side by side weight comparison with my LG Versa phone and they felt about the same to me.  Its official weight is about 5.5 ozs.NavigationScrolling is a breeze. Works perfectly, never selects unwanted objects while scrolling, and is only limited by the speed of the downloading, which I found more than adequate, especially since I am used to Comcast high speed internet access on the Sony Win7 PC. There are 5 different home screens, and each can be customized to a theme, or you can just put stuff on them if that is what you want. They do share a common background/wallpaper, however.Operating SystemI read a lot of negative things regarding Android 2.1. However, my phone came with Android 2.2 and I have not had any problems at all. It is truly a multi-tasking operating system, I can play music, download files and navigate through apps all at the same time with no noticeable delays. Now you need to understand that I am used to dealing with Microsoft windows, so my expectations are very low for any operating system. So far, I am pleased with Android 2.2, I have found no glitches, and my phone has only frozen once and that was caused by the SD Card (needed to be reformatted for this specific phone). The integration between apps and operating system is mostly seamless, but again, every specific app has its own characteristics and quirks.Dropped CallNever ~ that's why I stay with Verizon. Coverage is better than AT&T;, as I have verified over and over again during my travels across the US. I get coverage everywhere I go. Period.Camera/VideoThe 8MB camera built into the Droid-X is actually better than my 8MB Canon SD870 IS. The pictures are clearer and the videos are far superior. Droid-X claims video resolution is HD720P and I have no reason to doubt that spec. To view the photos and video, I used the basic app [Gallery] that came as the default app. I have paid good money for photo display apps on my PC that aren't near as nice as this one. It seamlessly integrates video with photos, so I can walk-through everything instead of going to a different folder or display setting. Since my HDMI cable has not yet arrived, I cannot test the upload to PC or TV capability, which is the true test of any video (anything looks good on a 4' monitor but how about a 40' monitor?).  Still, HD720P is 720P so it should look good on any size screen. Digital Zoom - Yes, Flash - Yes. What else do you need to know. Just go and take some pictures. As far as sound is concerned, the Droid-X had 3 mics, and one is used for noise-canceling, and during my headphone sound test, I was able to clearly hear the birds singing and chirping in our back yard. Now, the iPhone 4 does have one very big advantage over the Droid-X, a front facing camera. If you are using video phone or Skype, that would be a handy feature to have, to be sure.AppsOk, so Android does not have a million apps like the iPhone. Oh, boo hoo. There are thousands of apps and I'm sure there will be millions at some point but who really cares. It took me over an hour to go through just the free apps offered in 'The Market'. I found a dozen or so that I started with, and most of them were fun, entertaining, informative or whatever they were suppose to be. I'll just get into a few specific apps in this review, and the rest ~ download them and see for yourself. The Droid-X had 8GB of internal memory dedicated just to apps and the operating system. That doesn't really sound like a lot to me, as I have a T-byte drive on my PC and it is somehow getting filled up with who knows what. But, after downloading apps all day, I still had 6.26GB remaining, so I guess I shouldn't worry too much about it ~ download away!EmailVerizon hooked me up with both Google gMail and linked in my Comcast email account. I haven't used the gMail account but the Comcast account works flawlessly and pressing a single email icon retrieves my inbox. Also, one of those 5 menu screens I previously spoke of contains the inbox right there on the menu screen, so what could be easier. Of course, this is only a copy of the email so I have to delete emails in two places now, but that is not a big deal to me. For those of you who get 100s of emails a day (and I know who some of you are), you would be advised to download some sync software, otherwise you will be spending a lot of time managing your email files.MusicThe primary reason I wanted an iPhone was for the music. My wife and I have several iPods and we use iTunes to manage all of our music, so I was a little worried about how that would all workout with the Droid-X.  My previous experience with cell phones that play music (i.e. LG Versa & ENV2) is that they Suck (yes, that is the technical term). So I was forced to carry the cell phone and my iPod when I went on any trip or walked the mall, or whenever I wanted to listen to some good ole rock `n roll.Those days are over. My very first downloaded app was DoubleTwist, which is free. It has both a PC and phone component. Once you download the PC component, it auto-syncs with your iTunes library, and builds links to all songs stored in iTunes with the exceptions of songs purchased through the iTunes store. As soon as I hooked the phone to my PC via the supplied USB cable, it began to download [sync] all of my music to the SD Card in the phone. I have almost 3,000 songs so that took a couple of hours to complete. Please note that all Verizon phones want you to download V-Cast, but avoid the temptation since that software, well how should I say it, well it sucks too.Once all of my music was downloaded, I just touch the DoubleTwist app icon and I am off and listening. I only use the shuffle function, but DT imported all of my playlists, so there are lots of options regarding how to select and play your music.The unexpected bonus is that the other Music player app that was preinstalled in the Droid-X also plays my music, and I can even play it when the phone is in the multi-media charger by pressing the > music icon. What could be easier.Pandora RadioAnother free app you simply cannot live without if you are a music lover. Once you download the software, you can pick an artist or category of music and Pandora Radio will dynamically build you a playlist. There is a 30 second commercial every 15 minutes or so, but someone has to pay the bill for free music, so I did not find this too annoying.BlueTooth SupportI have the Nokia BH-905 Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Headphones, and I was able to pair these headphones to my Droid-X on the very first try. Now, with those other phones (the ones I previously mentioned that sucked), they would switch to mono every time I turned on the music, and if you pressed pause, then goodbye music. Ugh. The Droid-X interacts with my Nokia headphones seamlessly (have I used that word here before?)  All functions [volume, next song, last song, pause] work from the headphones as well as directly from the phone (I have trouble calling the Droid-X a 'phone' because that does not begin to describe this device).  With those other 'phones' the music would often skip, stutter, or even squeak.  None of these 'special effects' have occurred since I starting using the Droid-X. The sound for both my music and Pardora Radio is incredible. I've never heard better sound quality from any MP3 music player, and I've owned quite a few of them. Speaking of seamless, I got a phone call while listening to my music, and it automatically switched over after a couple of beeps ~ so be carefully if you are singing along to the music as I was at the time ~ oh embarrassment!. Once the caller 'hung up' the music starting playing again, from the exact point it left off, and I was back to my singing (but I have decided to keep my day job). I will eventually learn how to turn-off  the phone's auto-answer while I am in music mode, since there are definitely some people I don't want to talk to (most have 877 numbers).Battery LifeAnytime you run multiple apps concurrently, you drain the battery (battery 101). Just make sure that you don't leave the apps running, which is not always as easy as it sounds. Since the Droid-X is a multi-tasking device, you can be playing music, downloading apps, and navigating through your email at the same time. If the battery becomes an issue, download Advanced Task Killer and use that to terminate unwanted app run-on. Personally, I do not find that the battery discharges any quicker than those other lesser phones (those phones that suck, remember).Upgradable SD CardThe Doid-X comes standard with a 16GB 'user' memory card installed. I opted for the 32GB upgrade since I am known as a data snob and carry around an 8GB flash drive in my pocket. After loading my 3000 or so songs, I still had over 5GB left on the original 16GB card, so maybe I didn't need the 32GB card after all. I'll throw it in a drawer and if I ever need it, I'll just pop it in, re-sync my music and I'll be set for another 4000 songs or 40 hours of video. Now the lesson learned here is that you should go with the original 16GB card and not pay the $100-150 for the 32GB Upgrade if you don't need it today. As we all know, next month it will be $89, then $79 and within a year you'll probably be able to buy it for a $1 or so. But hay, we are all entitled to make a mistake, and this was mine.3G Mobil HotspotNow I did have to pay the $30 per month for the unlimited data plan, but I did not pay the $20 for the 5 user WiFi hotspot upgrade. Let someone else pay for their internet connection ~ not me. The Droid-X does come with WiFi built in and I have already connected to both my home network and TGI Friday's network. It takes less than a minute to connect. The only advantage to the WiFi connection vs. the phone network connection is the download speed. However, I could not tell much difference in the speed, so the only time I will probably use the WiFi is on a plane, or some other special situation where my phone service is not available. Note: Using the WiFi feature does eat the battery, so be careful out there.Multi-Media Docking Station AccessoryThe other accessory I opted for in my 'bundle' was the multi-media docking station. Yea, I love it. When you dock the phone to the station, it automatically turns into a giant clock/weather station. Even with music going and the display running, the phone charges in no time, unlike my last phone that took literally hours to charge through the PC USB connection. The docking station also provides for an HDMI connection, so if your Droid-X is located near a PC that has an HD Input (My Sony Does) or an HD TV monitor, you can stream your videos or photos to that output device through the push of an icon or two. Wow, What power!In Summary* Bigger than a Breadbox ~ Yes* Better than Sliced Bread ~ Yes* Able to leap tall building ~ You Bet* Do I love it ~ Ahhhh Yes",5
"***Disclaimer*** I am not a technical genius. I do not understand the words and phrases I read on techie websites.  I do not use this phone to its fullest capacity.  But, I do know what I like, and I like this phone.  ***End disclaimer***This is the best phone I have ever owned.  I used to think my last phone, the Blackberry Storm, was the best phone, but after using the Droid X for two weeks I am thoroughly impressed!  I will list a few of my pros and cons.PROS-Google Maps is awesome.  I use verbal commands and the phone will give me turn by turn directions, it will type out texts, it will google search for me, and it does it all without having to take my hands off the wheel and start typing in commands.-SWYPE is very cool too.  Instead of using my thumbs to type or text, I hold the phone with one hand and use the index finger of my other hand to swype along the screen from letter to letter.  It is much faster than typing.  I love it.-Camera.  The camera is an 8MP digital camera with a lot of options and effects.  It takes great pictures.  I do not think of it as a 'phone with a camera' but rather as a 'camera with a phone.'  It also takes some very impressive HD video.  And you can email the videos on this phone.  My Blackberry Storm took videos, but I could not send them.-Internet.  The Internet is way better on this phone than on my Storm.  It is like I am surfing on a small computer, not a phone.-Apps.  Loading apps could not be easier.  How cool is it that you just scan a barcode for the app and the phone takes you right to the download page for that app?  Pretty friggin cool!CONS-Ringtones.  I still do not have this figured out to my liking.  This is the one area where the Storm was a lot easier.  I could easily set profiles for notifications, set different rings for voice or text, or my favorite, set the phone to phone calls only at night so some random email does not beep in the middle of the night.  I have downloaded a few ringtone apps but have not been able to get them set up the way I like yet.  I am still working on it.-Holsters.  I cannot find a holster for this phone that is acceptable.  I have been using the 'slide it in my pocket' mode, but that does not always work out for me.  I am pretty active during the day and the phone will sometimes get banged up in my pocket.  The market has the plastic clip-in cases that leaves the phone exposed.  I have read many reviews on those and it seems the phones sometimes falls out of the clip.  That is not acceptable to me.  Plus I like the phone to be covered in case I rub against or bump into something.  I have come across a few fully enclosed holsters, but they are not something I want to wear on my belt.  One was black leather with gold stitching and a huge gold medallion on the side.  It looked like a friggin man purse or fannypack.  Now I am not normally self-conscious about how I look, but I am not carrying around a man purse or fannypack.  I also do a lot of trail running, so the phone would fly out of my pocket, and any holster would have to be secure.To recap, I love this phone.***10/6 update***I found a free app called 'Quick Profile' in the marketplace and I was able to set up profiles for my rings and notifications.  I now have one named 'phone only' that is basically just my phone, no other notifications at all.  Which is great because that is how I always set my blackberry at night.  No sleep disturbances for junk emails at night!  And if someone needs to get me in an emergency, they can call me.  I was also able to set up a few other profiles for 'office' which is mainly vibrating and low ringtones, and 'loud' which is for outdoors, and everything is set to vibrate then loud ringtones and notifications.Now if I can just get the holster thing figured out, life will be perfect, again.",5
"I've own many of the Verizon Wireless (VZW) smart phones including the Treo, Moto Q, XV6700, Saga, Omnia, Touch Pro, Blackberry Curve, Storm1, Tour, etc. I also owned the first Droid (D1) and thought at the time it was the best VZW phone I've ever owned. Well, Droid X (DX) has changed all of that.  The DX is now my favorite phone of all time.  But is it actually 'better' than the D1?!?!?!?  Check out my review.PROS- The DX's X-tra large screen is beautiful.  The touch interface is very responsive. I feels like a powerful computer in your pocket.- DX is big but I don't think it's too big.  I could actually 'do' a 5 inch phone if VZW ever sold one.  I use the DX one handed but I have big hands. ;-)  YMMV, however.- The screen size also makes typing on the screen easier.  I usually hate virtual keyboards but I like this one.- Web browsing on the big screen is a great experience.  I can see myself not using my iPad as much now (I would take it along to the barber, doctor's office, etc.).  When the DX gets Flash support, the iPad might be going to eBay. :)- HD Video recording capability is super great.- I actually like the new version of Moto Blur.  The re-sizable widgets are cool.  Plus you can remove anything you don't want to use.  I guess this wasn't the case with the original Moto Blur.  They just need to add a 'close' button (or swipe to close) to the widgets so I don't have to reach down for the back button.- Battery life seems pretty good, much better than the Incredible.- FM Radio is actually pretty good.- DLNA support will allow you to browse media stored on your computers, wirelessly.- The DX is V Cast compatible.- The DX has all of the standard Android functionality including the best, free voice activated GPS known to man.  Need directions to '123 Main Street'?  Simply press the search button and say, 'Navigate to 123 Main Street'. Want to know where the closest Pizza place is? Say, 'Map of Pizza'.  Google voice navigation is unbelievably good.- The DX includes full Microsoft Exchange support.  I'm not sure if it includes remote wipe or other security features that were missing from the initial D1 release.CONS- I usually prefer physical buttons but the ones on the DX aren't that great.  They feel cheap.  Plus they are all the same height so you can't easily press the button you want without looking at the device.  This takes away one of the biggest advantages of having buttons.- Like many smart phones these days, DX doesn't have Send or End buttons.  I don't understand why companies make PHONES that don't include buttons for starting and ending a PHONE call!- Unlike D1, the DX power button is in the middle-top of the phone.  This probably helps out the lefties (the D1 power button is on the top-right). However, I don't like the extra reach for the power button.  I'm already reaching over a much larger device.- Motorola has locked/encrypted the boot loader on the DX.  Thus, it will be harder or impossible for third party developers to create custom roms for the DX.  I think this is a mistake.  Custom roms is one of the biggest reasons why the D1 was so popular.  The d1 put Android on the map.- 'Free' wifi tether is not available at this time but hopefully soon.- The syncing software that comes with DX is nothing to write home about.  Syncing music, photos, and video to Android phones still remain a hassle.  Google needs to develop something like iTunes ASAP.  I read that they are working on a music service though...- I find it hard to put the DX in its desktop doc.- Haven't tried the camera much yet...VS BLACKBERRYI read that the growth of Android is more likely to hurt Blackberry (BB) than iPhone and I believe it.  I tried many phones and always went back to the BB for it's reliable and efficient email experience.  The keyboard, trackball, shortcuts, sleep case and more kept me very productive. Unfortunately, some of the BB advantages like push email, MS Exchange integration, unlimited messaging, etc. are now available on other platforms.  Add to that, the BB doesn't have many of the nice features or apps offered on other platforms.If 90% of what you do is send email and text messages, the BB is for you.  Other than that, I can't really recommend a 5.0 BB device anymore.  Hopefully BB OS 6 and the new web kit browser will change that.VS INCREDIBLEThe INC has a nice screen but it's hard to see in day light.  The INC also has incredibly bad battery life lol, possibly due to questionable signal strength.  I have to laugh when I read about people disabling stuff on their INCs just to get the battery to last a day.VS IPHONEI think the DX is one of the best alternatives to the iPhone, if not the best.  However, the advantage the iPhone has over the DX is really about the OS advantage. iOS offers better apps, better developer support, better integration with the desktop, and better overall user experience.  The fact that Google leaves android owners to fend for themselves to sync data from the desktop is an epic fail.  Sure, I can troll web forums, try several Market downloads, and get something to partially work. iPhone users don't have to do that.  Within 10 minutes of getting their new phone home, iPhone owners can sync music, video, apps, photos, files, video podcasts, video rentals, files, etc. to their phone.Also, custom roms are nice (DX doesn't even have this yet) but I don't think most consumers care about that.  Flash might be a big differentiator but for all we know, Apple may soon allow flash to run on iPhone 4.Until Google offers better desktop integration, the iPhone will maintain a significant advantage over Android phones.VS DROID 1This is a tough one...  For me, it really comes down to how much you value the bigger screen over custom roms and/or having a keyboard.  Some people may be interested in the DX's HD video recording as well.  I can't say which is better because it comes down to what features are most important to you.  I have to lean toward the DX being 'better' at this point.  The bigger screen and faster processor makes it better than the stock D1.  If you hack the D1, all bets are off.  However, if the DX gets custom roms, overclocking, etc., I think it will become the clear winner, at least until Droid 2 comes out. :-)BOTTOM LINEI think the Droid X is best stock VZW phone available.  Its big screen makes it really a computer in your pocket.  The HD video recording capability is great. DLNA support is great.  I didn't even know an FM radio was included- nice!  Battery life so far has been really good, especially considering its big screen.  The DX offers just about anything you need in a phone sans the front facing camera.  This one device may replace a standalone mp3 player, gps, camera, camcorder, netbook, and possibly, an iPad.  The Droid X simply does it all.Is it the best Android phone on any carrier?  I haven't used the EVO so I can't say which I would like more.  VZW's voice network and customer service are better than Sprint's so the EVO loses in that respect.  The Incredible was crippled with poor battery life so that's a no-contest.  The only real, current competition is a hacked Droid 1, if you care about hacking your phone.  I personally don't care about custom roms.  For these reasons, I think the DX is the best Android phone to date.  However, the current champ may lose its belt to one of the many great phones that are coming out soon.  But at the end of the day, the real winner is the Consumer.  There will be many great devices to pick from and that's always a good thing.TIPS- Hitting the home button twice brings up the voice dial app.- For free USB or blue-tooth tethering to your laptop/netbook, try PDANet.- You can tether to your iPad!  You have to jailbreak the iPad and install the blue-tooth dial-up networking.  Search one of the iPad forums for details.",5
"Hi recently upgraded to the droid x and within a week found out the droid X2 was coming out so I returned the X and upgraded to the X2.  Both are great phones with a lot of similarities, the big difference is whats in side the X2.  If you can get a good deal on the X1 get it, you will be happy it has a great display, cool 4.3inch display and plenty of options but for the 100 dollars more or whatever the difference is if you can swing it, it may be worth it to get the X2.  The X2 has the same 4.3 inch display plus a qhd higher resolution screen.  X2 is the first dual core processor for verizon so it packs some power over the older x1.  The best feature to me is mirror mode which when using a mini hdmi cord(purchased through amazon saved 15 dollars), displays whatever you are looking at on your phone on your hi-def tv.  All in all you cant go wrong with the X1 or X2 and I wantede to let you know differences before you purchase previous model, it may be worth it to you to spend a little more and get a X2, or save some dollars and get the X1 which should keep most extremely happy.  F.Y.I.-all the droid X accesories work for either droid so if you already have X1 and want to upgrade all your cases and everything will still work.  Hope this helps someone, and happy shopping!",5
My wife and I have had these phones for a little over a week now and we love them.  I like the bigger screen since I use the internet alot.  The sound is good and people say I sound clear when I talk.  If you like to get on the internet alot then you want as much screen as possible.  I love it.,5
"Instead of a novel, here's my review. (Will Update)It's pretty big.  It's a big boy.  Seriously, it's big.  Horizontal, it's perfect for texting.  Standing tall, it's really standing tall.Battery is pretty good.  Normal use, it last of 8 hours until it needs to be recharged(settings may differ).Browser has flash, but download speed on the browser isn't that good for stream.  Once the stream player works, it's pretty good.  Manage to get Justin.tv working.Touch screen works well, when not lagging, but sometimes too well.  Sometimes, I just had to hover my fingers over and it would press the icon/letter/number its self.8MP camera is horrible (well lit)indoors, but great outside.  The real best use of the camera is when on camcorder mode.Freakin power-house on the Verizon Wireless network.  Downloaded 12 apps/wallpapers at the same time in 1-2 minutes.  Problem is some apps will be running even if you don't want it too.  It's not the phones fault, but just a warning. The whole thing about how a Verizon customer can't talk during a call and access their emails, text message, surf the web, etc., is B.S.  Did it and it worked out great.The options of setting settings on the phone is there, but it's not really that accessible, unless you know what you're doing.One problem I had was trying to make a basic phone call.  I just got my new, free, android and could not make a phone call due to its laggy performance.  Thankfully, it's not happening any more.  Another thing I haven't got totally control of is the feeling that this smart phone is really a living, breathing thing.  It's constantly doing things behind my back, via widgets/apps, so I'm constantly programing Droid X that I don't want to download updates, stop telling me about new emails, and switching to different navigation - 2 comes with the phone standard) because one thinks I'm lost.PS.  To those who didn't know, GPS doesn't use data.  So don't purchase Verizon's.  I basically had my phone on 'Air Plane mode'- which turns off data and phone call aspect - and still manage to have the GPS working.It's pretty fun phone.  It's like the iPhone, but Jailbroken, which is really nice.",4
"A word of caution: this phone is more massive than you're probably picturing it!  With it's chin and forehead and back-hump this phone just barely fits in the front pocket of a pair of jeans.  Don't even bother with a case, the combo would be too big for anything but a duffel bag!That said, this is an amazing smartphone.  It runs Android 2.2 (but will get an update to 2.3 this summer) and has a 1GHz TI processor inside.  What does that mean to you?  You can run all the latest apps and games without so much as a hiccup.  It used to come with way more storage and now only comes with a 2GB card (weird) but you can always upgrade the storage if you need more for pics, music, and apps.The display looks great (for an LCD) and this thing can hold a signal and make a call where almost all other smartphones fail.  Thanks to built-in noise-cancellation and the absurd signal strength, you sound like you're on a land-line even when you're in the most rural of areas.So what are the downsides to the Droid X?  The size and the mechanical keys.  Whether those are downsides to you depends on personal preference, but you should be aware of those two potential issues.  I prefer a smaller (4-inch) phone and touch-keys (that will never wear out or fail).  But that's just me!  This thing is an amazing phone and even if you buy it now (near the end of its life) it will be more than fast enough for at least the next 18 months.",5
"After owning a Blackberry Storm 1 and then Storm 2, I find the Motorola Droid X the best of the bunch! Much larger screen, apps are MUCH cheaper (and definitely MORE selection of them), not to mention easier to download and install! The touchscreen is a lot more responsive and easier to use (once you get used to it) than on a Blackberry, and the integrated Gmail seems to be more reliable than the POP email I've used on Blackberry. I do not have to perform regular battery pulls as I have had to with the BB either. I just love everything about this phone and would not trade it for the world!",5
"When I originally decided to make the switch from Blackberry to Android, I did a great deal of research into the whole Android platform, what's good & bad and did all I could to be entirely ready for the whole new learning curve that a brand new OS usually brings. My plan was to hit the ground running and be as proficient as possible with my new phone by the end of the first day...and THIS is where I ran into my first speed-bump. I went to literally a dozen stores hoping to get an X only to find they were all out-of-stock and the back order was 3-6 weeks. This of course was my own fault for not making the leap when the X first came out. No, I waited a while and found they were totally out everywhere I looked. So I ordered one anyway, and waited. And waited. Week after week I waited. I finally lost my patience (partially because I was going to give my wife my BB Tour and she was quite interested in trading up seeing as her old Curve was in dire straights and we weren't sure how long it'd last) and just went in and ordered the Incredible.I was initially VERY impressed (see my review) with the Incredible. Unfortunately the sales rep told me a few things in order to get a sale from me that turned out to be entirely false. Namely that the DInc had the same pre-installed SD card as the X--it does not. Oh, and she also said that the 2.2 Froyo update was already done and ON the phone--it was not. This was--IMO--a blatant lie in order to secure a sale. Had I been working with just a regular sales rep at the Verizon store I went to I suppose I could forgive an honest mistake, but this was the Manager, and this kind of mistake was almost certainly an intentional one. I bit my tongue, however and moved on. After a few days decided that I just wanted the bigger screen and came back--to the same Manager--and informed her I would like to use my 30-day trade-in option. Once again, there was NO X in stock and they really couldn't tell me when another would be coming in. I began to get discouraged but a funny thing began to happen literally the moment I began to seriously consider keeping the DInc: I began to really like the phone...a lot.After a couple weeks I woke up and found the OTA Froyo update was waiting for me to activate. Initially I was VERY excited knowing the phone improvements would make it even better. I noticed better battery life (improved by about 15-20%--but keep in mind the DInc's battery woes were abysmal to begin with) and improved web loading. What I DIDN'T initially figure out was with the update came a few new widgets that would spontaneously start up regardless of how often you used the Task Killer to close--or even by Force Closing it using the Manage Application function. I would routinely check my Auto Task Killer and notice City ID, Skype and a few others almost ALWAYS on and running. I do not use (at least not at the moment) ANY of these apps and yet they would auto-start ALL the time. This infuriated me until I read on dozens of forums how using an app like Auto Task Killer are not really all that necessary because Android is designed to manage most of those functions all by itself. I DO use a Task Killer, but only to exit from the Internet and manually close some of the apps I use now & then and just leave the rest alone. I set the ATK to ignore certain apps and discovered my phone STILL worked fine and I noticed absolutely ZERO lag time or issues with the phone slowing down with some of those programs running quietly in the background. Face it, unless you physically open Skype, or City ID and tell it to DO something, it really isn't using up any memory. For those who are absolutely anal about shutting off absolutely everything using a Task Killer, look around on the 'net and read some of the forums--especially those from Android developers--and see if this isn't true.Right at the point when I was accepting the fact that my DInc was forever going to be mine, I got the call that an X had showed up. I rushed over, made the trade and I wake up the next day with mixed emotions. I had really grown accustomed to the HTC Sense UI and I gotta say, that overall it was a MUCH more polished and better all around LOOKING system than what I now have with the X. That does not mean I don't like my X, though. They are just two very different phones using a variation of the exact same OS. One just happens to be more polished than the other. I have noticed that the screen is just amazing on the X. Bright and obviously huge...but not TOO big. The X has a few more pixels than the DInc does, but since one has a smaller screen, the density is greater and therefore the Amoled screen on the Incredible also looks brilliant and very vibrant. One thing that hampers the DInc in a VERY serious way was the ability to read it in direct sunlight. I had read all over that this was a major problem, but dismissed it because I rarely used my phone that way--or so I thought. It was amazing how often I did, and boy did it suck under those circumstances. The X on the other hand was much easier in sunlight to see and read. Point goes to the X on this one.One place I noticed another difference was in swiping the Main screen to the adjacent screens is more responsive on the Incredible and I have found several times that the X takes several seconds to even register that I tried to go from the Home screen to one on either side. This puzzles me because they are both comparable in every way--even down to the 1 gig processor...so why the lag time? Oh well. After using 2.2 on my phone for a few weeks I now am back to 2.1 Eclair on my X, so that too is a small step backwards. It'll come, eventually so I'm not too worried.I absolutely LOVE Swype. The X comes with it right out of the box, but I really had to look for it for my DInc. The Beta trial had ended at the Swype homepage, so I looked and looked (and even downloaded a VERY similar app called SlideIT which worked great--but after a few days it too ended because it was just a trial version) and finally found Swype for free. I have noticed ONE thing that the version on my X had that wasn't on the version I downloaded to my Incredible was the microphone option for times when I don't want to use my fingers and just speak out what I wish to text (a progam which is absolutely freakin' amazing, btw), there IS one on the Swype keyboard on the X...but I had to change out the keyboard to the original on the DInc in order to use that function. It was a bit annoying, but didn't really bother me. Its nice to see it included here.I also kind of miss the buttons along the bottom of the DInc along with its optical trackpad. The physical buttons on the X seem quite a bit different--and not in a good way--than what the Incredible had. Just more responsive on the Incredible. I miss them more each day...again, oh well. There are several reasons why you may like one phone over another, and this is also one of the reasons why I believe Android will eventually really eat into iPhone sales: diversity. HTC makes Android phones, and so does Motorola & Samsung just to name a few. Each company have placed their own unique version of Android on their phones, some are better than others, some have options the others do not but its the options that make the platform so amazing. If I hate AT&T; (and I DO, with a passion...) but still want the iPhone on T-Mobile...I'm SOL. However I get plenty of options if I want an Android phone, because they have at least ONE model on each and every carrier in the US (more depending on which provider you may have). Being able to customize your phone, having the TRUE ability to multi-task with a Droid versus what iPhone passes off as multi-tasking (and ONLY with the most recent version--if I am not mistaken) is just SOME of the reasons why this platform will not only work, but thrive. For those who are insistent that iPhones are better I say this: honestly, its just a matter of opinion at this point. If I had an option to get an iPhone on Verizon, I really might get one. I think iPhones are awesome (their reception issues notwithstanding), but there are things you can do with Android you simply can't do with the iPhone and vice-versa. The app market for BOTH platforms are SO huge now that it really doesn't matter which phone you get, there are more apps than you will EVER need and all the good ones developed for the iPhone have a counterpart for Android, too so that point is essentially moot. If you are willing to accept AT&T;'s absolutely horrific so-called nation-wide service, be my guest. Having had such a terrible experience with their service with my BB Bold in my particular area pretty much soured me on them for good...however YOU may get fantastic service where YOU live, so again, its a matter of preference.Undoubtedly I will make some updates in the coming days and weeks as my experience continues to grow....but I also feel compelled to note that the biggest problem with Android thus far is how amazing they are and how much fun they are to play with can seriously eat into your productivity at work--IF you let it. Keep that in mind and come back soon and see what else I felt important to add to my review. Oh, and thank you for reading.***UPDATE #1***Battery life on the X is definitely better than on the Incredible. I'd say roughly 30-40% better...and considering how massive the screen is, that is saying something.I have noticed an ENORMOUS difference in switching from the Incredible to the X while browsing the internet. I guess you don't really know or appreciate how much different and better the experience is as a whole with Froyo 2.2 than with 2.1 until you use one for a few weeks and then switch to the other. HTC put Flash Lite on the Inredible even without 2.2, but WITH Froyo, the internet really IS dramatically improved--seriously. I didn't quite realize it until I went surfing around yesterday and discovered a WORLD of difference. For those iPhone users who balk at not having Flash (and according to Steve Jobs, never WILL) as not decreasing your overall internet viewing experience...you are 100% deluded. The difference is simply amazing. I suppose if you've never trolled around the 'net using a phone that was Flash capable you don't really realize what you're missing, but TRUST me, you are. My Incredible had a setting which allowed me to view websites in mobile phone mode, or view them as I would on my desktop computer. So far I have not found this option on the X. I just may download Skyfire until my 2.2 update arrives, I haven't decided just yet.I really like being able to re-size widgets on any of my 7 screens. I wish I could re-size them to whatever size I wanted, but they are pre-determined and some won't re-size at all--but having SOME options is better than none, right? I gotta say I really miss the stock HTC calendar that came with the Incredible. I have tried locating another version online and at the app Market that can compete, but so far I'm coming up empty.The alert light at the top of the screen just to the Left of the speaker is MUCH easier to see than the ridiculously microscopic light that the Incredible employed. It was VERY difficult to see, even when looking almost directly AT the phone face...if it was turned only slightly one way it simply did not register to the human eye. I am very happy with this improvement on the X. One option that the X has that the DInc didn't was being able to make the alert light blink in different colors. Hey, I'm just glad I can SEE the darned thing, but having this new option is downright awesome.The X camera is on par with the DInc's...which is to say that as long as you have decent light, the photos ROCK...if you are indoors, with even minor low-light conditions, the photos come out amazingly grainy. I can see a day--not too far off either--where phone cameras will entirely replace regular digital cameras, but so far today is NOT that day. Haven't fiddled with the HD video capabilities much, but I'll post an update about that soon.As much as I hate to admit this, I now almost--ALMOST believe the phone is too big. If I had purchased the X before having the DInc I am positive I wouldn't be having this issue, but going from one to the other is quite dramatic. I now think that a 4 inch screen is probably an ideal middle ground between too small and too large. I still love the gorgeous crisp and colorful screen of the X, but after becoming SO used to the Incredible's size, it almost feels like I'm trying to walk around with an iPad in my pocket. Again, I doubt this would've been an issue had I not gone with the DInc first...and the issue is minor at best, but if I'm honest, it IS a factor--not a big one, but one nevertheless.***UPDATE #2***I am VERY impressed with the camera function of the DX--especially in comparison with the 8MP camera on the DInc...mostly because the Incredible's camera was just plain S-L-O-W. Even WITH a 1 gig processor, it seemed to take way too long for the camera app to load properly. Once deployed, the moment you wished to capture just may have been lost--and if that wasn't enough, once you tried to actually *snap* the pic, it seemed to take forever before the shutter eventually snapped. My 7 year old Palm Treo 650 was faster, by a pretty large margin, too. Granted, I realize the Treo could only do a fraction of what todays phones are capable of, but you gotta realize in terms of technology, 7 years ago was practically the stone-age when it comes to how far things have progressed. The reason why this is interesting is because just yesterday I was reading an online review which compared the X with the Incredible and one place where the DInc beat the X was with the camera. According to the review, the exact opposite happened than what I had personally experienced. The X was slow to snap pics and the DInc was much faster. I find this very bothersome because with the exact same phones we are seeing totally different results, and I have to wonder why. Also, photos that I have uploaded to Facebook do so MUCH quicker with the DX than with the DInc...even AFTER it had upgraded to Froyo (still waitin' on that 2.2 update for the X btw...).On the flipside...the speakerphone for the X is abysmal. The Incredible's speaker was light years ahead and 3-4 TIMES louder. Granted I don't use it that often, but with a phone this big, I just naturally assumed the speaker would be AS big, too...not so. For my money, the best speakerphone I have ever heard on a cell phone came from my old original Blackberry Bold. Now THAT was a great speaker. Even my work-issued older BB Curve has a much louder speaker. I'm a bit surprised here at why this one thing has been neglected by Motorola, but it isn't by any means a deal-breaker--however, if YOU require a very loud speaker for your phone, I would seriously think twice. Check one out in person before making any purchase at the very least.I discovered--quite by accident and very embarassingly so--that when you place your phone on Vibrate, that incoming e-mail notifications may STILL make an audible reception notification. This happened to me yesterday while teaching a lesson in Church. Not exactly the kind of place you want to discover that your phone isn't entirely in the 'Silent' mode. However, now that I have found this out, I have to wonder why, when you place the phone on Vibrate this can still happen? I really DO like options, however this is one place I would rather prefer it to be really simple: when I put the phone on silent, I want the ENTIRE fuction of the phone to be silent. Is that too much to ask for? Just sayin'...***UPDATE #3***While doing a sales call to a local Sprint store yesterday, I noticed that the display model HTC Evo was running 2.2, so on a whim I went out and checked if any updates were waiting (you have to manually *check* for them on the X while on the Incredible I woke up and it showed on the home screen a notice that an update was ready to download) and sure 'nuff, there it was, ready to go. It took maybe 20 minutes to download and completely update, which was nice seeing as it was in the middle of my work day and I really can't go without being able to use my phone for too long.The update changed the way the screen looks when I initially turn it on, a few small cosmetic changes have been noticed in the calendar function, too--all for the better. I did notice that my Swype screen keyboard looks almost 100% different...but that was mostly in color change--although why they felt the need to alter that I have no clue, it looked fine before--but oh well. Flash is now on and running...however I have noticed that even though I discovered how to tweak the internet settings in order to view webpages as they normally appear on my desktop instead of on mobile settings (NOT a simple fix, mind you), many websites STILL render on my X with the mobile page version, which bugs the crap outta me. The Incredible did not have this issue. I have since gone back to see if my original setting did not save, and found out that it in fact HAD. So WHY is it that some webpages will not render normally?? Especially now that I have Flash I feel as though I am missing out on a cleaner & more full internet experience than what I had with the DInc. Just a bit frustrating if you want to know the truth.Also on a whim, I decided to see if I could download a copy of a movie I had on my home computer. It took a bit to figure it out, but it loaded fairly quickly, and within 10 minutes I was watching Iron Man in the palm of my hand. I gotta say that was pretty dang sweet. The picture quality was awesome and it rendered on my screen beautifully. Well done Motorola.On a side note, I wish to further moan about the 4 physical buttons at the bottom of the screen: I do NOT like them at all. Now I realize this is entirely a personal issue, because I have noticed many who reviewed the Incredible did not like its touch-sensitive buttons...but I have to say that having had and used the X now for over a week that I really miss the design of those buttons on the DInc. Also, as much as I wasn't initially a fan of the optical track pad on the DInc, not having one on the X highlights a problem that one will not have a problem with on the Incredible. Namely, when you are trying to edit anything you have written on the X, you have to physically point to it using your fingertip (it IS a touchscreen phone after all...) however--and I do NOT have big fingers by any stretch--it is NOT so easy to get the curser to place exactly where you want it using your fingertip...a problem which the optical track pad made ridiculously simple on the DInc. Its only major flaw of the track pad--IMO--was that you couldn't adjust its sensitivity like you could the old track balls used on older Blackberrys (at least not that I could figure out), consequently making moving the curser a bit slow at times--but infinitely more accurate than having to resort to using your finger to place the curser where you want it. And don't think that the extra real estate on the X's screen will make much of a huge difference, because in my experience, it was still a bit frustrating to get that blasted curser in between specific letters you wished to edit. This may not be a factor to many of you, however it certainly has been with me, one that increasingly annoys me the more I have to do it. Had I not owned an Incredible prior to this, I probably wouldn't even have noticed--but for those wishing to make an informed decision if choosing between the X or the DInc, well its definitely something to consider.***UPDATE #4***The DX (and DInc) are the FIRST smartphones I have owned without a full Qwerty keyboard (and I have owned plenty)--something I thought long & hard before buying mostly due to my own reliance (addiction) to physical keyboards. I briefly considered the iPhone back when I was stuck in Purgatory (ie AT&T;). I considered buying one and using the virtual keyboard because it looked pretty well laid out all things considered. I had a Windows Mobile Tilt 2 for a few months (the single worst phone I have EVER owned--mostly due to how bug-proned Windows Mobile is & not HTC) and wasn't a huge fan of the landscape keyboard (I felt it was actually TOO big to use easily). I thought long & hard before purchasing the DInc without a keyboard. The speech-to-text feature was simply awesome. It made texting a breeze and after I found a version of Swype to download I was SOLD. The DX comes with Swype (and a newer version was updated when I downloaded Froyo) and after having a keyboard-free phone now for over a month, I find that with Swype and the speech-to-text ability, I don't miss the keyboard at ALL. In fact I encourage everyone I have a chance to that IF you have an android based phone, if you can get Swype, you will NEVER need one ever again, which is saying a LOT coming from someone who used to feel a keyboard was absolutely ESSENTIAL for texting and emailing. Not any more.What can I say? I STILL love my phone and all it can do (and I am discovering NEW things it can do with new apps almost daily). As for the android operating system? I am 100% SOLD. All things considered, I don't know which to endorse, the Incredible or the X...it just depends on what you personally like. If you want the extra real estate that the X's screen provides, well then you can't go wrong with it...however if you want a phone that'll do everything the X can only smaller, the Incredible really IS pretty, well, incredible. I say that to make sure, you absolutely MUST go to a store and physically handle BOTH phones first before buying, because if size IS a factor, then think twice before getting the X. While it fits in my pocket and isn't a nuisance to carry, not everyone will feel this way. Just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied. Oh, and good luck!***UPDATE #5***Okay, I've had my phone for nearly a year now and it STILL Rocks! Honestly, I seriously love my phone. During all this time I've figured a few things out that I am hoping will help others.First: after a few months, I noticed that my screen sensitivity was seriously off, making texting via Swype all but impossible. I'd re-start it, do a battery pull, almost everything without success. I finally Googled the prob and discovered many other people experienced the same thing--but they took note of one thing I had missed--it ONLY happened while the phone was plugged into the wall charger. As soon as I figured this out (and it WAS exactly the problem), I've not had any issues since. I don't know why the screen goes haywire ONLY while being charged, but it does, and as long as you recognize that, you won't have to do as I did and erase everything on your phone bringing it back to factory specs only to see the exact same problem persist. Boy that was a mistake to wipe my phone.I've been itching to upgrade my phone to OS 2.3.3 aka Gingerbread for quite some time now. Supposedly Verizon & Motorola are on the edge of releasing it to the public officially--however, as I write this, no OFFICIAL 2.3.3 update has been released by Verizon for the DX. I DID find what appears to be an un-official GB update that some have insisted were pushed to their phones from Verizon (this story has been denied AND confirmed by 'sources' all over the place--whether or not its real is anyone's guess at this point. I found it and after a great deal of difficulty, figured how to load it. The typical instructions were far and away over my head--but I ended up downloading it to my computer--attaching my phone to it and I just dropped it into my sd card that way. My phone is NOT rooted btw. I was worried that by doing so it would wipe the memory--but it didn't. The overall update was much more cosmetic and less obvious than the initial upgrade from 2.1 to Froyo...however, the changes have been very GOOD ones from my standpoint. The task bar at the top is no longer white, its a dark blue and all the typical images have a whole new look. Dropping the task bar has also been updated. If you have more than one update, you can dismiss each individually or all at once if you prefer--a small change to be sure, but I have found it to be very convenient--much more than I had expected. For me personally, my favorite upgrade has been when you text or write, one of my biggest complaints about Froyo was that if you wanted to find some text you noticed had been mis-spelled, you had to get the curser to move with your finger to the right place--which in itself was a challenge at times. For those with big fingers, I can only imagine how difficult that has to be. With the upgrade to GB there is a small arrow-like icon that comes up when you write text and it is large enough that using it to point the curser to wherever you want it isn't a problem whatsoever. I am LOVING this new improvement. Along with a few other small--but very welcome changes like MUCH improved copy & pasting--which really should have been included from the very beginning, it all works for the better.I have also noticed improved performance pretty much all around. Virtually no lagging in between the 7 main screens, faster internet, and faster all-around performance. I have seen several YouTube videos which chronicle the improvements in detail, so you can check them out at your leisure. All I can say is don't expect Gingerbread to be a HUGE change, more cosmetic, but trust me, these changes are good ones and really does help the phone in many ways.I have decided my next phone will ALSO be an Android. I cannot see myself switching to anything by apple at this point. Not for what my Droid offers me right out of the box. What an awesome device.",5
"I've had this phone for about 2 weeks now. I use my phone for both business and entertainment and it performs both functions very well. Email works well. I find it easy to search for email, to flag important email and to mark email as unread. I can also open most attachments. You are notified of new mail by an audible alert, a small green flashing light and an icon in the upper right (naturally you can configure these notifications in the settings. The calendar also is acceptable. I was impressed with the battery life. I can make it through a whole day on a charge. It is better than my palm pre and my pre had a larger battery I bought from Seidio instead of the stock battery. Also, I love skype, this is one of my favorite tools. It works beautifully on the Droid X. I was blown away at the call quality. When not using skype, the call quality is still good, love verizons network.I make lots of calls for work, especially conference calls. This is why skype is so handy. However, I did learn one super cool trick. I got a google voice number and added that number to my Verizon friends and family list. I then put an app called flex dialer on my phone which can route any call I make through the google voice number. This means no outgoing calls are counted toward my minutes no matter who I call or how long. I can turn this feature on and off with a widget. This comes in handy if I know I'm about to make a long call with a client.I was particularly impressed with the app market. I have an ipod touch so I'm familiar with what is in the apple app store and android apps are just as good. Yes android may have fewer apps but the good ones, the ones you are really going to need or want are likely going to be there. One of my favorite apps is the skyfire browser. I love having flash on my mobile phone, it really makes your web browsing experience closer to that of a real PC.Leaving a Palm Pre for a Droid X had me worried about two things, inability to multitask and pocketability. The Pre did both of those things. Droid X can't multitask like the pre and that is frustrating at times but all the other features really make up for it. As far as size, yes it is big but not too big to stick in your pocket. In fact I had it in the pocket of my dress shirt at work when I was waiting for my case to arrive, no problems. I've grown to love the big screen and after having used it, the screens of other devices seem tiny.A few things I'm not crazy about. The keyboard. In landscape mode the keyboard takes up way too much of the screen. It makes it hard to navigate through the paragraph I'm typing. Trying to scroll back up and look at what I've typed and then move my cursor to a different paragraph is a very clumsy process. My other gripe is the camera, it isn't bad but I was expecting better. Nobody needs to lecture me that megapixels are not the only feature that impacts picture quality. I know that. I just thought that if Motorola was going to make an 8 megapixel camera, they would have a final product that could take better pictures than this. They aren't too bad but they are a little more sensitive to motion than my last camera phone. Also they can be grainy if there isn't sufficient light.I have a love/hate relationship with motoblur. This tool pulls your facebook contacts into your address book. This is cool since many of my coworkers are also facebook friends. Now I see their facebook picture when they call me. I also see their facebook update in my contacts. Neato! On the downside, like most people I have some facebook friends that I havent seen in 20 years and I don't want them in my contact list. I cannot figure out a way to get these fools out of my contact list. Yes, I can hide them, but that isn't what I want. If any of you Droid X users out there have any suggestions for me please speak up.",4
"08/22/10 UPDATE:  QUESTION:  Would the large screen of the Droid X allow users to see more things or the same things in a larger size on its display?  Has already been over five weeks of using the Droid X and no complaints.  This week I ran some 'home tests' trying to answer the question on how programs will be seen in its larger display and have included some Photos.The process was a direct comparison with my I-Pods Touch (running IOS-4).  Said Apple products were used because their display is the same size as the I Phones and the recently introduced Droid 2.  The I Pod Touch accessed the Web trough Wi-Fi and photos have not been adjusted, only cropped to size.  The results showed some unexpected results that answered my question but not the way I anticipated.  Included are photos demonstrating what I describe below:1.  Keyboard.  The virtual keys for the Droid X are almost double the size of the Apple device. More important, the keyboard stretches to the full screen when in landscape (the I Pod does not have landscape capability even with IOS 4) and the key organization of the Droid seems to be designed with users in mind as for having included the period and the comma in the main screen amongst many other goodies.2. Displaying e-mails. When the same e-mail is displayed in both devices. No major differences as for content but fonts in the Droid X are almost twice the size as in the I Pod Touch.3. Urbanspoon. With the Urbanspoon, the information is about the same for both devices. The larger display of the Droid X is basically lost area with the 'urbanspoon' logo.4. Weather Bug. Using the Weather Bug, the Droid X shows more content and more important, shows an additional decimal digit for the temperature reading.5. Browsing the Web.  On C-Net's TV podcasts, the larger screen of the Droid X allows users to see more information on the display.Thus, answering my own question on the larger display on the Droid X, seems that all depends on the way that specific applications/programs were designed for the Android Platform vs the I Phones OS.  On some instances (e-mails), things were displayed larger.  On others, the larger display of the Moto device allowed more content to be displayed (Weather Bug & the C-Net website).  On a third group, exemplified by Urbanspoon, the content is the same and the larger screen shows basically useless/dead space on the display.A point to remember.  These are home tests done with I Pods from 2007 and I have not yet played with the Droid 2.  The Droid 2 has many features from the Droid X and new I Pods  will soon be unveiled with a front facing camera and not unlikely the Retina Display of the I PhoneFour4.  And I use I Pods for e-mail and web browsing through Wi Fi only, never to watch movies or even for music listening.  For these, I use old Zen Visions (from 2004) which I modified with 120 GBs of HD space.Hope that these comparisons are useful or at least interesting to you as a consumer and if someone conducts similar comparisons with the Droid 2, the I Phone Four or the new Sammys, will be worth reading about the results and your opinion.08/14/10 UPDATE:  It has been almost a month (29 days) using the Droid X and time to decide if I it should be returned or if it is The Keeper because the VZNs 30 day return policy ends tomorrow.  Since my last update, one major event happened.  After all the fuzz & buzz regarding the E-Fuse that allegedly Moto had installed in the Droid X and will self-destruct the phone if users tried to modify it, I decided to see if indeed the phone would  self-destruct while still under the return policy.Last week when VZN sent the Froyo (Android 2.2) for the Original Droid users, I was able to download it from the Internet.  The phone was backed up (over the air) and the Froyo file copied on a Micro SD Card.  Following the instructions, installed the card and rebooted the phone.  Opened the zip file and although it seemed to self-install, the phone went dead.  I thought that the feared E-Fuse had gone off and would have to go to a VZN store with a credible explanation of what have happened.But checked on the Internet and found a posting on how to get the phone in recovery mode.  Thus, replaced the Froyoed card with the original one, got the phone in Recovery Mode (with the mechanical buttons; power & volume) and was able to restore the Android 2.1 OS.  Rebooted it again and the phone self-synchronized with VZN and all contacts, links, etc, came back as backed up.  Applications had to be reinstalled one by one.  Thus, seems that the story of the E-Fuse that self-destructs the phone is not true at all.Have used the phone in low reception areas and even with the signal meter showing just one bar, can access the Internet and make phone calls.  Battery life continues to be excellent and with the customization capabilities of the OS, the phone goes into a sort of sleep mode (called Off Peak Hours) at midnight and wakes up at 7:00AM.  With a third party application; Tasker, have been able to do modifications as to which 'things' are on in specific events.  For example, the GPS turns itself on when any of the applications that use positioning is launched.  Otherwise it is off.  With said application and moderate use of the device, have been able to get up to 48 hours from a single battery charge of one hour.For those of you who are considering the Moto Droids, be aware that you must have a Google E-Mail account to access your contacts.  Google allows you consolidation of other e-mails or you just import your contacts from Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.  Your Google E-Mail is accessed on the phone and all the information of your contacts show up.  The latest from Google is that they allow you to log on multiple accounts from a specific device.  Very convenient but anticipate that this will end.The keyboard has proven to be very convenient, especially the large virtual keys and the predictive texting.  With just the first three to four letters of a word, alternatives show up under the texting area and you pick up the proper word.  On 08/12/10, Google announced the One Voice for voice recognition or voice to text.  I installed it but does not work.  Seems that needs Froyo and the latest reports are that will be delivered over the air on the first week of September for the Droid X.A couple of things that I had not covered before.  The camera and camcorder work great and files can be searched alphabetically or by date.  Video streaming is uninterrupted but have not received any with HD resolution.Having said all this, I must re-classify the Droid X with five stars, especially because even after erasing the OS, was able to self-configure itself over the air and have not had any problems at all with the new toy.  It's a keeper until at least next year.Hope that my review and updates have been useful to you.07/31/10; UPDATED REVIEW.  First, thanks for the consumers who have found my Initial Review helpful and classified it as such in Amazon.  Has been two weeks using the Droid X as my only means of communication besides Skype.  Overall, it is an excellent device with amazing customization capabilities but have found that the Droid X may have an even more limited customer market.  As amazing as the Droid X is, IT IS NOT A PHONE FOR PERSONS WHO ARE TECHNO OR COMPUTER CHALLENGED, at least for now, if they want to get the most of this marvelous Moto engineered toy.  Otherwise, there are many simpler phones that will not complicate your/their life(s).THE BAD:  First issue, being such a new device, not many vendors have the accessories for it and even though I received the ordered seven in one package from Amazon, still, no one has manufactured the proper case for the phone.  See last photo below.Second, the Verizon website offers plenty of features to customize your phone and play with it; messages, ringtones, etc.  But it does not work with 64 bit computers.  And after downloading and installing the software, you get a message that it does not support computers running 64 bit OS.Third, there is not much information on the Web and most of it relates to the original Droid which is not compatible with the new X version.  After following advices posted to load ringtones, videos and photos, noticed that most were wrong and had to erase all the OS system.THE GOOD:  Reception, battery life and call quality continue being amazingly good for a device with such a large display and now that I have been playing with some Multi Media features, can give you an update on these. Besides, the phone has become the center of attention of some persons; from a Security Officer at the local Airport to friends that have noticed the change from my Blackberry look alike old Nokia (E-71) to this MONOLITHIC 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY Movie alike icon.Unlike other devices that limit MM features, if you work around, you will be able to customize caller IDs with JPGs (not animated graphics like some Samsungs), from your favorite characters to recent pics of your kids and/or significant persons.  The Photo Gallery even included the date of the pictures you uploaded.  The audio is OK with a single rear facing speaker unlike other devices which have two speakers.  The only limitation encountered is loading videos.  Have tried at least 10 different movies to be converted from VOBs into compatible and reasoably small formats but unable to load these on the X-device.Thus, after using the Droid X for two weeks is still a KEEPER that fulfills my needs as for a device that can make calls, browse the web, get e-mails, messages and use a GPS w/o paying the extra $10.00 monthly fee usually charged by Carriers.Now, if for whatever reason the Droid X was not the ideal phone for you, my advice is:1. If you would consider other Carrier, try the HTC Evo from Sprint.  The 4-G capability is not available everywhere.2. If you want to use VZN but the X version of the Droid id too big a device, consider the Incredible.3. If you want to use ATT, try their version of the Samsung Galaxy but be ready for dropped calls.4. If you need to have T-Mobile, check their Sammy.  It is thicker due to the slide out mechanical keyboard and their amazing Nexus One has been discontinued.UPDATED CONCLUSSION:  The big, bad, mean new toy AKA the Droid X is for consumers who want or need the essential things from a Smartphone including good quality phone calls, e-mail & internet browsing.  And the persons that will most enjoy it are those that have the interest and the time for of customizing it.Hope that this review helps you deciding on which phone to get this summer.  If you want to wait until January 2011, several new devices will be available operating at twice the speed of the Snapdragon & Hummingbird processors.  But let's see what FroYo [Android 2.2] brings to these Droids in the next couple of weeks.Several photos of the Droid X have been included and sorry that these have not the best resolution/quality.  Here are descriptions of them:1. Comparing the size of the I- Pod Touch (32GBs) with the Droid X and the Nokia e-71.2. Main screen of the Droid X with the Galaxy wallpaper (included on the phone).3. Comparing how an e-mail looks like between the Droid X and the I-Pod Touch.4. Comparing the Weather Bug application in both devices (I-Pod has not been updated as for location).5. A more detailed view on how the Weather Bug looks in the Droid's huge display.6. Cases; the one on the I-Pod is a cheap one from E-Bay, the one on the Nokia is Boxwave's Designio case (not yet available for the Droid X) but the best I have found.7.  Holster; too large for even this big toy.Keep tuned for my re-evaluation once I receive the HDMI cable and compare the X-Droid's A/V capabilities with the TV native sound/video resolution.----------------------------------------------O7/26/10: INITIAL REVIEW:  I have been using the Droid X for ten days already.  Uncertain if it was the device that fulfilled my needs, conducted several 'home tests' to evaluate three key things; battery life, reception and call quality.  The Droid has many other features but these were not relevant for my decision if keeping the new Moto device since I regularly use other devices for said purposes;  a Zen Vision for video playback & music, a Camera for pictures, etc.As documented by others, the Droid X is a big device, even taller than the HTC-Evo.  Its back is metal covered by a rubberized textured material which prevents slipping from sweaty palms and fingers.  On the Left Lower corner has the slot for a Lanyard which I hooked at the store.  Not many phones have kept Lanyard slots nowadays and it was a nice design detail from Moto especially for a big device.  Is not as heavy as you will anticipate and the mechanical camera shutter bulge is convenient for proper grasping.The phone has been customized for my needs and preferences, from the animated wallpaper of a Galaxy (not the Sammy Galaxy Phones) to the icons on the seven screens.  Yes, has seven different screens unlike the original Droid which came with three.  When turned on it shows the I Phone alike unlock bar which is not the most convenient way.  Nokia phones are unlocked by pressing two keys in sequence.  The screen is bright for almost all places except under direct sunlight.  Nevertheless, screen brightness can be increased.The operating system is the quite familiar Android 2.1 with nothing spectacular or unique on it.  Applications load quickly and I have not experienced freeze-ups even with multitasking.  The thing I like most of the OS is that it allows you plenty of customizing and even monitoring battery use per components; cell standby, display, voice calls, phone idle and Bluetooth as well as an indicator of elapsed time since you last unplugged the device.  There is also the capability of turning on / off the Bluetooth, the Wi-Fi, the GPS and Airplane mode trough colored icons in one of the main screens.For purposes of my evaluation if the Droid X was a phone to keep or pass and wait for the Samsung Galaxy next month, I tested the reception going into places where I knew that signal strength would be minimal.  This is just a comparison that has limitations and the most important variable is the change of Carrier from ATT to VZN.  Tested and compared with results with prior performance using the Nokia E-71 with ATT.  Not very fair but the Nokia is the device I have been using for more than two years.RECEPTION:First test; on an Inside Elevator, doors closed floor 8 (in a 20 story building).  None of the phones were able to make a call.  Calls initiated before entering the elevator were dropped (with both devices).Second test; Underground Parking.  Nokia dropped calls and was not able to initiate any calls.  Droid X, calls not dropped but voice quality deteriorated.Third test; a street downtown between tall buildings.  While the Nokia was not able to initiate calls, the Droid X was able to do them even though the communication was interrupted.Variables were minimized calling the same persons, representing the four main cell phone carriers; ATT, VZN, Sprint and T-Mobile.  I am aware that this test is more of indicative of different Carrier coverage and signal strength than differences in the phones as such.CALL QUALITY:After each call (made or received) I told the person who I talked with that I have changed my phone and wanted his/her opinion if they heard me better, the same or worse than before.  Half of them responded that voice quality was the same and half said that it was better.  No one said that it was worst and the Nokia's are well known for their good mike & speakerphone.  Worth mentioning that calls were made under multiple settings such as windy places, a noisy shopping center and also in the silence of my office.  Perhaps, the key factor for the Droid's performance it's the multiple microphones it uses, one for cancelling environmental noise.BATTERY LIFE:Perhaps, the most important factor in my decision to keep or exchange the Droid X.  Nokia phones have an excellent battery life and my E-71 was charged for an hour every other day or even every third day  with regular use.  Regular use for me is from five to ten short calls a day, checking e-mails and browsing the Internet a couple of times a day.  Wi-Fi is always on receiving e-mails and Bluetooth always enabled with either headphones or even the car stereo.The Droid X allows users many configurations regarding battery use and which applications features are on or off as well as how illuminated you want the screen.  It becomes even more user customizable with third party applications but I decided to run the battery duration tests with the three settings that Moto offers.  Worth reminding that on a device with such a big display, most of the battery will be used by it.To conduct this test you just go into Settings/ Battery Manager/Battery Profile.  There are three native options; Performance, Smart and Battery Saver Mode.  The results with my 'regular use' were:Performance:  After overnight charging, using the Performance Setting (with the brightest display illumination) battery lasted an average of 28 hours.Smart Mode:  Same use after overnight charging, the battery lasted an average of 36 hours on three trials.Battery Saver Mode:  Similar use & charge, battery is lasting over 40 hours with at least 50% of the charge left according to the device battery meter (with said setting).  On this mode, the battery use by the Display shows only 29% compared with 34% use for the Cell Standby, 19% for Voice calls, 11% for Phone Idle and 9% for the Bluetooth.  This mode allows you also to configure specific settings for Peak hours and Off-peak Hours as well as individual display brightness.  I have not tried yet the phone over 40 hours without recharging, afraid that might have a dead phone at some time.CONCLUSIONS:I am aware that this initial review might be subjective, has variables outside my control but though of publishing it to help consumers that are not decided on what device to get in this revolutionary summer of new smartphones.  It will be very useful if others can compare the Droid X with similar devices using the same carrier; VZN.  As for my needs, the Droid X does fulfill the three main ones and seems that it is a keeper.SOME RECOMMENDATIONS:Due to its size, the Droid X might not be for everyone.  Definitely not for kids, petite persons or those who are technologically challenged.  In ten days I have been able to spend hours 'playing' with the device and customizing it for my needs and likes.  One of the features I like most is that when I receive a call the phone 'speaks' the name or number of the caller, shows the assigned avatar, image or photo followed by a short vibration and if I do not answer the call, the designated ringtone starts to play.Being the Droid X a new device, not many vendors (or even Verizon) have the accessories for it.  Thus, I am using the Lanyard from my old Nokia, a Screen Protector from a full size Garmin GPS and an old case from a large camera which had a belt clip.  The only place where you can get accessories (for now) is through the major website seller and I ordered a seven in one pack which includes the HDMI cable.During the following days I will test the Multi Media capabilities as well as it's Internet, e-mails and social media features.  Meanwhile, I hope that this article is useful for those of you that still have not bought their new smartphone.  Have fun researching which one is best for your specific needs!",5
"There appears to be a lot of misinformation on both here and on the web about chargers that will work with the droid x. I hope my experience will clear up this confusion. By the way the droid x needs micro-USB for data and charging. It comes with a 100-240V AC adapter 5V 850mA with 1 usb port and a USB-to-micro USB data cable. You can charge with the AC adapter or with just the data cable in any computer USB port.1) The mini-to-micro USB adapter works fine, both for charging and data transfer. I've confirmed this on 2 old motorola mini-USB chargers, and a spare USB to mini-USB data cable I had lying around. This is the one I got (Motorola SKN6252 MicroUSB Adapter Cable for Motorola Droid A855).2) iGo works fine. I've converted both an old A32 (mini-USB) using the adapter above, and also own the A97 (bought it here). Both charge. I love the igo system mainly because I can take it on the road and charge everything I own pretty much (except my camera), and it has surge protection built in and ranges from 100-240V.3) Plantronics explorer 245 charger don't work. Comes with micro-USB charger, but 5.0V 180mA only. I suspect it is too underpowered to charge the droid x. Most forums note that the charger is 850mA and USB ports max at 500mA per port (USB 3.0 maxes at 900mA per port). Thus I suspect at least 500mA is necessary to charge the droid x and the higher mA will result in faster charging times (haven't tested this myself).4) freaking out the phone screen. Some reports on the web note that certain non-motorola chargers have been known to mess with the screen, causing random selecting, dialing, etc or just making it unable to use during charging. I think most reports finger the old Droid. I have not had any trouble with using my droid x while charging yet, but will update if this happens.5) ID chip put into motorola chargers so you can't use non-motorola chargers. I have not encountered this yet, but haven't tested extensively. I tried my friend's blackberry micro-USB charger and it worked fine.6) Data cable. As above the USB to mini-USB with the mini-to-micro adapter works fine for data transfer and charging. I also purchased some USB to micro-USB cables here (Motorola Droid / Droid X Micro USB Sync and Charging Cable from SF Planet). They work perfectly for data and charging and have a thick cord that will likely resist breaking. They are however rather short. I would have to say the data cable is the cheapest way to get additional reliable chargers, assuming you have USB ports everywhere. I put one in my work bag just in case i need a quick charge at work. Could be carried in the pocket easily as well.7) charger from motorola H17 bluetooth headset. This also charges the phone and comes with a micro-USB 5V 550mA 100-240V charger. This is very economic headset right now on [...] (35$, if you get bulk and don't care about variety of earpieces) and works pretty good (pairs with 2 phones, flip switch on/off, 2 mic noise cancellation). If you assume the charger is 15$ separately, you're getting a solid bluetooth headset for 20$. I haven't trusted yet the dirt cheap chargers here on amazon, partly because of the bad associated reviews.Please make comments if you have anything to add to this.",4
"The Good:* Great call quality* Solid overall messaging* Android OS* Android Market and tons of free apps* Rich multimedia experience* Free navigation softwareThe Bad:* Exchange support from stock app is lacking even with FroyoBottom Line:  The Droid X is great multifaceted smartphone that will become an integral part of your daily life.My detailed usage based review follows.Call Quality:  Let's face it.  It doesn't matter how cool all of the other features are if a phone doesn't perform well on the original intent of cell phones.  The Droid X, however, happens to excel in this area.  I had a Motorola flip phone about five years ago, and I loved the call quality it provided.  It doesn't matter if it is a regular call, speakerphone, or on Bluetooth, the Droid X has outstanding voice clarity and volume on both ends of the call.Form Factor:  One of my biggest worries with the Droid X was how big it is.  To satisfy my concerns, I went to a Verizon store and asked if I could see what one would feel like in a case attached to my belt.  It is by far the biggest phone I've had lengthwise, but I haven't found it to be a problem.  It also feels good in your hand much the same way that the Harmony One Remote does (see my review).  Don't fear the bulk of the Droid X because what you get in return is well worth it.Bluetooth:  Speaking of Bluetooth, I started out by pairing the Droid X with myJabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headset(see my review).  While I had read inconsistent information on this topic, my experience is that voice commands worked over Bluetooth.  The Bluetooth radio (even if not connected to a device) does put an extra drain on the battery of the Droid X.  I keep it turned off unless I am planning to use a Bluetooth device.Messaging:  The Droid X has support for a myriad of messaging capabilities including text, G-Mail, and Corporate Exchange Servers.  While Android provides a Universal Inbox, I prefer to view messages separately by type.  Fortunately Android lets you access your message the way that you want to.  I have to admit that I was hesitant to go with the Droid X for messaging because I have had an LG V, EnV, and a BlackBerry Curve 8330 (see my reviews) so I was very attached to a phone with a physical keyboard.  However, I have been very pleased with the virtual keyboards on the Droid X.  I enabled Swype entry which allows you to trace the letters of the word you want to type and automatically adds spaces between words.  I played with this feature in a Verizon store before purchasing, and I would recommend anyone who is hesitant to do likewise.  With my text entry concerns addressed the Droid X is a highly capable messaging phone.  One final note, though, is that the Exchange support is pretty sketchy with the stock client after I upgraded to Froyo.  I will be purchasing either RoadSync from DataViz or Touchdown.  I have trial versions of both installed.  Each works well at a basic level, but there is a cost difference.Android:  I'm combining a few attributes here.  The Droid X comes with 7 home screens preconfigured, but users have almost limitless customizing capabilities on how the screens are laid out.  I use very few 'widgets' (Motorola or Android) because most of these maintain data connections or otherwise drain the battery.  As such I lean toward application shortcuts instead, and I get my information on demand.  The great thing is that you can tailor your user experience to suit your needs and concerns.Also, coming from a BlackBerry I was absolutely thrilled with Android Market.  There is no comparison between Android Market and BlackBerry App World.  Whether its performance or selection of apps, Android Market wins in a landslide.  Also as one would expect, Google provides apps that are only available for Android such as Sky Map which is very cool.  There are also apps aplenty for news, sports, weather, social media, and the list goes on and on.Multimedia:  This is the first phone that I've given serious consideration to multimedia on.  The stock music app is OK, but there are many alternatives available for free from Android Market.  I am currently using MixZing which produces good sound, good features, and a decent user interface.  Android market also has apps for Pandora, Slacker Radio, and Last.fm to name a few.  I don't think the sound on mp3's is as good as it is on myCreative Zen X-Fi MP3 Player.  The X-Fi processing produces a quality of sound that is hard to beat.  However, I will be switching my mobile video watching (mostly from Amazon Video On Demand) from my Zen X-Fi to my Droid X because the screen is much larger.  I can also watch HD videos too.  I can't do the quality of the display justice in words.  You've just got to see it.  When connected via Wi-fi, I love watching YouTube videos with the 'HQ' option turned on.  The multimedia experience on the Droid X is really, really good.It is also great on the capturing side.  The 8 Mp camera takes sharp pictures, and I was surprised at the quality of video capture.  I have used theFosmon HDMI to Micro HDMI Cable (5 Feet)(see my review) to view both on my Magnavox TV, and the results are unbelievable.Navigation:  I am also shocked at how much better Google Maps performs on the Droid X vs. my Curve.  I'm sure some of it has to do with the increased horsepower on the Droid X.  The navigation app is also pretty well done for something that is included with the device.  It is not as full featured as a Garmin, but it should satisfy most basic navigation needs.  It does give spoken turn by turn directions, and I found the routes to be pretty reasonable.  It's hard to argue with having one less device to carry and not having to pay anything additional to do it.Games:  I'm not the biggest gamer in the world, but there are plenty of free games in the Android Market that appeal to me too.  I have word and number games along with various card and domino games.Overall:  The Droid X is a must have device.  It does so many things well without messing up the basic phone functionality.  I'm very pleased with having made the switch from my BlackBerry, and I have not looked back.  Highly recommended.",5
"I was with AT&T; and had the iPhone 3gs. The iPhone 4 had been out a couple of weeks. I hated the iPhone and I hated AT&T; just as much. The iPhone is a terrible phone when used as a phone to actually talk with someone. Dropped calls, bad reception, and garbled conversations. I decided to leave the iPhone and lose AT&T;, even if I had to pay a Early Termination Fee (ETF). I wanted to get on the Verizon network, and I waited until the Droid X released. I love this phone. I love the screen, the google android OS, and I love the verizon service. It took a little time to adjust to the android OS since I was so used to the iPhone. The only negative thing I can even say about this phone is the touch screen 'smoothness'. Sliding between screens and transitioning from landscape and portrait mode is less 'appealing' as on the iPhone. It's just smoother on the iPhone. But that's about the only thing about the phone I can say that's not better than the iPhone. The Droid X delivers in every other area. It feels much more comfortable in your hand b/c it has a more 'rubbery' casing. Screen is great. The Android Market does not have near the apps that the apple app store, but many of the apps I used to use on my iphone are available for my Droid X. Except for games. I had a lot of games on my iphone, and I really miss that. I hope the android market picks up soon, but I game a lot, whether it's ps3, xbox360, or on my phone.Anyway, I am glad I made the switch from iPhone 3GS/At&T; to Droid X/Verizon! I can't stand the closed 'ecosystem' mindset at Apple.I do recommend this phone to anyone considering one of the larger touch screen phones.",4
"I've had a smart phone before, and my last phone, the Samsung Rogue, was internet ready, and I never used any of it.  My daughter got the Droid X and I had instant phone envy that continued for about 8 months before I finally was able to upgrade to my own. I don't regret it for a moment!It's not perfect...there are few things I wish it had, like the ability to just swipe across the screen to go 'back' instead of having to click the back button. I seem to have a bit of trouble keeping the ringer volume where I want it and there doesn't seem to be a way to raise or lower the volume of someone you're speaking to on the phone. (This may well be operator error!) Also, I have noticed that I cannot turn the volume down low enough when playing music to listen to it as I go to sleep. It just doesn't have enough of a gradual change and is either just a bit too loud or off. Lastly, the charger cord is only 3 feet long, so you need to leave the phone near an outlet to charge. I will definitely be looking around for alternatives to that, as I use it so much I need to charge it frequently.Other than that I adore this phone!  The screen is big and beautiful, and the 3G works great when I'm in a place with a good signal. A bit harder to get quick response to web pages from my home, but I've used it in public and have very, very speedy response. This is not the fault of the phone but my home location, where reception is fair to good.I love that I was able to eliminate the need to carry with me a phone, an MPG player, and a GPS.  I use the Droid X for all three, even connecting it via an FM transmitter to my stereo in  my car, which allows me to play my music over my speakers.  When the GPS is in use, it will pause the music to speak the directions over the speakers, loud and clear.  Far better than my old Garmin GPS, plus with the Android/Google interface, the maps are never out of date (unlike the Garmin!).I've also used the Voice Search feature to place hands-free calls in my car with really good accuracy, as well as to send a 'note to self' to automatically e-mail a reminder to myself.  The Google interface is a huge bonus to me, giving me instant access and sync-ability with my e-mail, Google Reader, Google docs, etc.The Android Market puts a lot of fun apps, both free and paid, at your fingertips.  The 7 'home' screens give you lots of ability to organize your apps and keep them at your fingertips. I've organized into a games screen, a weather screen, a music screen, a screen for apps I might need while in my car or out and about, etc.  I even have a page I haven't used yet, because I'm still discovering fun stuff.I bought aMotorola HD Dock for DROID X (Motorola Retail Packaging)to plug my Droid X into beside my bed and LOVE IT even more.  I will be buying a second docking station for my desk. I also bought a biggerSanDisk 16 GB Class 2 microSDHC Flash Memory Cardso that I had more room for music, pictures, etc. (For some reason, my Droid X came with only a 2 gb card, but my daughter's came with an 8 gb...unsure why.) TheMotorola SPN5400 Rapid Vehicle Power Adapter for Motorola Droid A855works great and fits well in my car. However, I would recommend buying different power adaptors than these,Original OEM Travel Charger + Data Cable For Motorola Droid X, if you need to, because, again, like the adaptor that comes with the phone, they are extremely short, and 1 out of the 3 that I bought didn't work (my daughter had this same issue).One last downfall...the Droid X (maybe Android phone in general) are not compatible with Windows 7.  I'm really unhappy not to be able to hook my phone up to my laptop (which has most of my music on it, etc).  I have to use my desktop computer running Windows XP. I've tried researching any work-arounds and haven't found any yet.But, despite the few negatives, I truly do love this phone!  I find something more I love about it each day and know at least 3 other people who have it and also adore it.  You can't go wrong!",5
"I  have been using the Droid X for about a week. Prior to that I used the original Verizon Droid and the Droid Incredible. Both were good Android phones but I found the Droid had sub-par audio quality when I used it and the Droid Incredible Sense UI (which I did re-skin with Launcher Pro) was more work to get around than a more (but not totally) stock Android.So I upgraded to the Droid X.Audio quality in my testing is much better. It's likely due to the extra microphones that help to drown background noise. The navigation is smooth and quick. I never had problems with lags on my prior to Verizon Androids either.What I really like is the bigger screen. The device is naturally larger (to accomodate the big screen) and I've not found that to be a problem. More screen real estate makes it easier to read email, visit web sites and arrange icons on your desktop.The stock Motorola UI is pretty good. I've since replaced it with Launcher Pro and the only thing I really miss is the contact widget. I'm awaiting the next upgrade to Android (Froyo) which will deliver the ability to place a direct link to a specific contact number on your desktop.Battery life has been as good or better than the Incredible. I find that whenever I've read a gushing review about great battery life that the reviewer follows up with some type of 'of course I'm shutting everything down -- GPS/WIFI -- when not in use). I'm not really micromanaging the power and in regular use I'm getting about a day (5am to 5pm). You'll do better if you shut some of the things like GPS/WIFI down when not in use  (which my personal pet peeve is that I shouldn't have to shut these things down - after all it's why I bought a smartphone in the first place).The Droid X is a great upgrade. No concerns on the size being too large. I actually believe that you'll see more competitors adopt the 4 to 4.3' screen size as a standard.",4
"I was a little leery of getting a phone with no keyboard.  Then I learned about Google Voice Actions (GVA).  I wanted this phone because of GVA.  My phone came with Android 2.1 and I was disappointed to learn that I could not use GVA unless I had 2.2.  Since GVA was free, VLingo decided to give their app away for free and I installed it on my phone.  I was surprised how accurate (99%) the speech recognition was.  I can search, navigate, email, text--anything done with the virtual keyboard can be input with VLingo.  Phone calls are clear and never dropped whereas I had daily problems with the purveyor of iPhones.I found that using the virtual keyboard was not so bad.  It has built-in suggested words that you can tap on, and any word you type can be added to the dictionary.  I like the easy customization of wallpapers and sounds.  It comes with a 16GB micro SD and you can install up to 32 GB cards if you like.  I use linux at home, so it doesn't connect so well with my laptop for transferring files.  I usually just use email or remove the SD card for huge files.  I do tether it for laptop internet use on the go.  You do not have to pay for 'hotspot' service to do this.I have now manually upgraded to Android 2.2 and things are even better.  The screen is clearer and the sound volume is better.  Processing and graphics are faster.  I can tell by real observation and usage as well as by running benchmarking apps.  Battery life has improved.  I would have recommended this phone before the upgrade, but now I am even more satisfied.I almost bought it here, but WF shipped it to me in two days, so I cancelled.",5
"This could have been the best Android phone available, at least for now and probably to come for a few months, but Motorola's attempts to distinguish themselves over HTC and Samsung had to spill over into the software.Hardware wise this phone is amazing, if there's anything to fault it might be that the form factor isn't right for you, but it really is just a winner.  Where it starts to go wrong is in Motorola's customizations to Android, either added or replaced.A prime example, Android supports sync with Facebook and Twitter through the official applications.  In doing so you can sync all your contacts OR just those you have as google contacts, thus not polluting your contact list.  You can also set which picture to use for a contact (google, facebook, or twitter) on a per user basis.  Motorola saw fit to remove this functionality and replace it with their own means which results in not only all of your contacts being dumped into your phone from each source but also you being forced to choose for all of your contacts as a whole which source to use for contact pictures (facebook or twitter, you can't default back to google).  This further introduces bugs in that the picture displayed isn't always the same one (the phone randomly switches them) and that with some contacts it will display the twitter user name instead of their actual name.Another example is the gallery, gone is the elegant display with Picasa account syncing, instead you're treated to a cover flow like representation of your images on the phone alone.  And another being the loss of the weather and news application/widget in favor of Motorola's very ugly weather widget and ugly rss reader.It's stuff that's just baffling.  Kudos to Motorola for improving this version of their custom UI over motoblur, but it's still bad/buggy and with the exceptions of the multi-touch keyboard, cursor dot/magnifier (like on an iPhone), and options to delay the security lock for the phone (which are all very nice additions) the changes seem to be for the worse, to replace the Android improvements post 2.0 with their own implementations.Pros:+ Amazing screen+ Fast, just bloody fast+ Feels very solid in construction, not cheap+ Great cameraCons:- Little buggy (Exchange support, notifications not going)- Tons of bloatware (MyVerizon, Kindle, NFS, 3G Hotspots, My Accounts, etc)-- Motorola's customizations (contacts, account sync, gallery, weather and news widget replacement)UPDATE:I have returned the phone (and gone back to the original Droid).  I spent 2 weeks with this phone but the bugs and the annoyance of the customizations made by Motorola just ruined the advantages of this phone over the Droid (original).  The bugs in particular for me were: the battery life doesn't indicate the proper levels - it shows 30% battery life, you reboot and it shows 60%, then an hour later I get low battery (15% warning), just made it unreliable.  Secondly I had issues with the sound not working consistently for notifications and ringtones - they seemed to become randomly silent leading me to miss texts and such.In short, while the hardware is nothing short of amazing, it's just a mess software wise thanks to Motorola's meddling.  Had they focused on the device itself and not their new UI then perhaps it wouldn't be so buggy.  While the UI customizations are my preference (-1 star) the fact that this is clearly buggy isn't a good sign (-1 star).",3
"This part came quickly and was exactly what I needed.  Phone was acting up and would sometimes go crazy thinking that i was giving it voice commands when the button wasn't even pressed.  This i because your home button plugs into this guy.  After replacing, it's like i have a new iphone that won't randomally call ppl when its humid outside!",5
"My iphone has been in the water and after many test, understood the problem came to this piece.Ordered it, changed it and now it works perfectly!!!!",5
"Was asked by a friend to try and figure out what's wrong with her iPhone. I used deductive reasoning and after replacing battery and realized it wasn't charging, I tried a different wire. That didn't work so I opted to replace dock connector and problem solved. Followed the steps on ifixit and success.",5
"This is not the most fun piece to put in, but is works. Sounds fine and the charging port fits tight again.",4
"I contacted this business to see if this connector worked for both CDMA and GSM and they said it did so I ordered it and it came pretty quickly. During the replacement, I noticed that the connector didn't reach so I immediately knew that this wasn't going to work for both CDMA and GSM. This is a GSM only product WHICH THEY SHOULD SPECIFY!!!!!! Anyway just letting you know that it's GSM only.",3
i cried when i charger broke but thanks to these guys i was back up and running in 4 days,5
"This is a great and durable case.The material makes it very easy to slide in & out of pockets without getting stuck.Love the simple black color of this case, Not a fan of flashy stuff.Only small problem is that sometimes if you are not careful about how you remove the case (like if you need to change screen protectors, or get to the battery, the little clips that hold the case to the phone may snap on you. I have had that before, but I just order another one for this price.",5
"This case fit my Motorola 2 Global like a glove.  It snaps on easily and can be taken off & on easily (just be careful with the little locking tabs - I lifted each one carefully to take the cover off).  Added no noticeable weight to phone.  Keyboard slides out easily for me, although my wife's seems to require a little more effort.This case is unbelievably cheap - My wife purchased a similar case from a Verizon store for $20 and it is not fitted to the phone as well.  Possibly, Verizon was trying to clear inventory of cases that will snap on & had the right openings, but it doesn't look as 'made to order' as this one.  Case adds a little 'grippiness' that comes in handy.Delivery was prompt & well packaged.",5
"What else is there to say... If it breaks that easy you'll have to buy a whole lot of these at once. One drop and (crack) done. I don't know about you, but replacing my phone would cost me about $500.00 bucks. Thanks but no thanks.",2
"I had to buy a new case as I got a Droid2 to replace the regular Droid. The design is just enough different that the front of the old case will not fit on the new Droid. I am very happy with this case. It fits well, and I like the texture and feel of it. Keeps it from slipping but doesn't add tremendous bulk. Good value for the money.",4
"I bought this case for my Motorola Droid 2 Global back in Dec. 2010.Pros:-Fits fine-Looks just like the pic onlineCon:-After 3 months, the rubber on the case is starting to peel off.",2
Bought this case for my daugther. She's dropped 2 phones in 6 months and them broke. Each had a hard cover case that popped off .This rubberized case is great...no way it'll pop off.,5
This is the best case for the Droid 2 Global. I have used a couple of cases before that were 'painted on plastic' or broke loose in a few weeks. But this one is made of a plastic coated with a rubber-like material that is durable and looks good. Very satisfied with this purchase!,5
I purchased several cases for my Droid 2 and I liked this one the best.  it was easy to install and fit the phone nicely.  it also didn't scratch as much as some of the other cases I'd tried,4
"solid case, does its job by protecting the phone. Not too tough, but it should protect a phone from average wear and small drops.",5
"This cover is junk. I put it on and the fit is terrible. The clips that hold it to the phone are so large and positioned in such a bad area that it perpetually bends the screen away from the keyboard so when the case breaks in a week like mine did, your screen will be bent 1/8th of an inch away from the keyboard. I don't write many reviews, but this was so bad I had no choice. Stay away from this item. Even if it were free it isn't worth a $300 replacement phone.",1
"This case fits the Droid 2 perfectly. It's a snug fit, meaning, I have to work at it to remove it.  It's slightly thicker than I anticipated and thus makes the phone feel 'fat'. However, it looks good, the rubberized feel is nice and it does the trick.",4
"This case fit my droid 2 global perfectly. It even has a full opening for the speakers and camera, unlike some other brands. However... I have gone through 2 of them in 8 months! And I'm easy on my phone. Unlike my wife, who has same phone but purchased different case for color options. She breaks her stuff all the time and has yet to replace her case...",2
"Great case for the money!  Bought 2 cases from the same manufacturer (one purple and this one) and for some reason this one seems like better quality, even though they were the same price.  If you're not expecting a high-end/high-price case, I think you will be satified with your purchase!",5
"For the price, can't beat this. It's like a cheaper version of the Seidio cases out there. The downside is it's a bit tighter to the back than the seidio, therefore you can't use it with extended battery (yes extended battery works amazing compared to the normal one). It is what it is, most people don't buy the extended battery, so if you plan to stick with the standard, or a slim standard, this is well worth the price. Be careful putting it on/off your phone as I've heard the clips holding it on break easy. It didn't happen to me, but did to someone else I know that purchased this.",5
I got this for one penny and it saved my droid 2 twice from concrete. It doesn't look bad and clipped on snugly. Every so often I can hear the plastic creek when I bend it in that tiny gap between the backplate of the phone and the cover.,5
"not sure what so many are expecting this case to do - protect and not make the phone bigger? choose one, can't have both.i think this case is superb. fits perfect, clips on tight but still able to get off easily, finish has just the right amount of grip without being sticky so you can slide it in/out of pocket, and good access to all the buttons and ports. as far as typing, very little difference with it on, in a few days you wouldn't even notice it. at this price you really should give it a try if your looking for some phone protection. i can still use the phone with my 'just wireless' generic open top smart phone holster (15$ at target, highly recommend for droid2).",5
"I bought this case while searching for cases for the Droid 2 with the extended battery. When I first got it i tried putting it on and it wouldnt fit, because of the extended battery and cover. So i tried putting the case on without the cover/ backing plate piece and IT FIT! THIS WILL WORK WITH THE EXTENDED BATTERY you just have to take the back piece off.",5
"This case was meant to protect my phone and it definitely did. I broke the first case already but I'm glad I got 2. After dropping my phone and breaking the case, my phone wasn't damaged at all!",5
Premium Rubberized Hard Snap on Case Cover For Motorola Droid Two Black worked as stated. it is  cheaply made but works.,3
"I have had the cover for 2 days now. It fits nicely and offers basic protection that I bought the case for. However, the thin rubber coating began wearing off on the edges on the 1st day and it is getting worse. Would I buy it again? Probably not. But the good news is that I only paid 2.50 for it.",3
"I thought it would be more plastic than rubber but it is very nicely rubberized on the back and sides for good grip. It attaches on fine to my droid 2 global. Feels study. Doesn't feel cheap but I have not been able to test it fully because I don't want to drop my phone to test it :PPro:Cheaper than Verizon cases that look and feel the sameDoesn't block any portsDoesn't interfere with an keys on keyboardEasy to installEasy to take offCovers up Verizon and Motorola branding [Could be a con if you like to show off your phone branding]Slim and lightCons:The ridge on the front side cover doesn't go along all the way to the 4 hardware buttons. (That is not a problem, just a personal design preference)Overall great case for the price. Basic protection without the cost, bulk, or weight added on.",5
Bought this for my little nephew for his new tablet and to my surprise none of the openings were where they were supposed to be. Then again what did i expect for the price right? I implore you to consider another case and take your business to other well deserving sellers that actually give you what is promised.,1
I got this cover for 6 yr old son's tablet. It worked so good. Which was a surprise because I got the same cover for my daughter but n purple & it did not last. So I guess buy the black one it will protect better.,4
"This was a good find however I did not find this as useful as I thought I would. It's great at not slipping from your hands or falling off the edge of your bed, but your tab can not take a hit with it. If your looking for something that you can just hold in your hands then this is it.",3
"I found this case after browsing at different cases to use with my new Galaxy Tab. The price, including shipping, was under [...], so I ordered it even with no reviews available, and it turned out to be better than I expected (an unusual surprise). The case is soft in feel, this  black smooth silicone is attractive, useful and protective of the tablet. It is fully covered in the back, with cutouts for the front and back cameras. In order to give greater protection to the tablet, I will get a screen protector next. A great deal. Get it!",5
"Not perfect for Samsung Galaxy Tab2.  Fits pretty well but doesn't provide all the correct openings/buttons to match tablet.  The areas that match OK are:  front & rear cameras,  power, volume, speakers and the charge connection.  Headphone jack opening is not in the correct place and there is a wide opening that doesn't correspond to anything on one side.  The last 2 items are not an issue for me.  If I ever want to use earbuds, I can create an opening where it belongs.......no biggie.The case  fits pretty snugly and has a comfortable softish feel.  It has a nice wide border to comfortably hang on to and allows me to avoid unnecessary fingerprints along the edges in both portrait and landscape.I have other types of cases for travel, but this is just for home and I like it.  I looked for a long time and couldn't find one like this.  I have one similar in a gel material that just comes up the sides and meets the screen, but I like this one much better overall.  Plus......this one was a better price.",4
"It's made from a very smooth silicone without any type of rough surface so it is actually more slippery than the tablet itself. The mold that made them must have been defective. In addition it is too loose and comes off very easily. I don't mind the missing hole for the head phone jack, it was very easy to cut a small hole in the top. I guess you get what you pay for.",2
"So soft and rubbery, it fit my galaxy perfectly I even put my metro card in in under my galaxy, was a good investment.",5
It fit great but not exactly but it will serve it purpose I would reccomend it to other customers and it is ok.,5
Not the best fitting case for the Tab II 7; but OK for the price. It adds an easier to grip surface so it won't slip. Better than the naked Tab II but their are better at a higher price. So for the money - GOOD.,4
Great fit plover it wow just what I order every tithing. Ship great on time fits on my kindle fire fits my x treme. And my sons android,5
It's really protective I went to sleep with my phone on the bed I woke up it was on its face I feared I had a cracked screen because it has happened to me before but to my joy when I looked at my phone lo & behold! No cracks no nothing! Haven't tried taking it off as yet as I change my cases frequently but it's really protective & worth the little money for it shoot it should cost more than what I bought it for!,5
"For $2 something box, it is a great case. Bought 2 of them for my mother, she loves the designs! Love the feeling of it when you hold it in your hands as well. The down side is that it is easy to remove, and so I wonder if the phone drops, would it go apart? Otherwise, all good!",4
"I ordered this because the picture is so pretty, I received it today- well ahead of the estimated 6 week delivery, I am actually a bit disappointed with the case because it does not seem to correctly fit my phone. It is a bit too small. I gave it 3 stars because it is a pretty case and delivery was fast.",3
Love the style however the paint was chipped in areas on this one but overall nice case and protects your phone,4
I ought this for a friend and seems like it was worth the money. Doesn't seem flimsy from what I can see.  The lip on the bottom around the home button is a little strange but the rest seems nice.,4
"The case is very pretty and has touches of purple - which you can't quite see in the product pic. Nice hard case, fits well on iPhone 4. Very happy with look of case on ugly white iPhone 4.",5
Very cute case looks like the picture. Fits my iphone 4 comfortly tho not exactly tight. I Would recommend it.,4
"This case will end your iphone 4 call like hotcakes.I think is it a bad design, everytime the case is on and you talk on the phone it will end the call for you.Removed it and problem solved.DO NOT BUY this case.",1
bought a new phone and wanted to be like the kids and have a cool cover and I did just that,4
Gave it as a gift and it was liked.  I like the fact I can change the look of my phone without paying a lot.,4
SUPER CUTE I LOVE HOW MAKES MY PHONE LOOKSIT SNAPS EASY AND ITS HARD TO TAKE IT OFF WHICH IS GREAT.LOOKS THE SAME AS THE PICTURE.FAST AND DELIVERY .. THANK YOU,5
"It fits my white iphone 4S perfectly and feels great when you hold it. It is smooth, but not slippery. However, after a week, the white part of the case slowly turns into pink, which makes the case looks very odd.",3
For the price the cases are great.  Imy wife has had made the case go through its steps for durability and after a year has only had some of the design wear away and one of the latches on the side finally broke and we are on the second case.,5
Absolutely love this phone case!! Covers the front and back for added protection. Love the design very bright and colorful. I would highly recommend to others.,5
I like it so far but have not dropped it yet to see how well it protects the phone.So far I would recommend it to anyone,4
"This is a cute, everyday case. I love the colors and was attracted to the red...but one of the swirly designs reminded me of an animal and I just couldn't get that out of my head. Ended up giving it to my niece. She loves it!",3
"love this one not only the color but the style with the front plate as well. only bad thing about white is makeup, but oh well love this one. Looks great",5
I received it earlier than expected which is great. Fits very snug. The design is nice. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive cellphone cover.,4
"First, the case looks almost nothing like the picture. Second, it is a pain to get off of your phone. I had to take mine off with a butter knife and it wound up breaking my iPhone housing. Don't waste your money.",1
"Dead On Arrival.  Plugged it into the phone to charge it up: blinking amber light = battery is no good.  Looked promising, too, as the battery looked just like the original one the phone came with and appeared to look brand-new to me.  Wrong.  Well, now you know why this item is so CHEAP.",1
I was never able to get this battery to work.  What a rip off.  I get the amber light showing when I first plug it in and then the screen of the phone flashes quick white lights several times before it completely shuts down.  Very disappointed in this purchase.  : (,1
I didn't expect much for the price I paid but this battery worked just like the original in my friend's phone (I bought it as a gift)It fit perfectly and lasted as long as the original.,5
"I needed a replacement battery for my wife's phone after the first one crapped out.  This one was as advertised, a replacement battery and it kept working another 2 years after it until the phone finally gave out.",4
"While the battery is an OEM battery in good condition, the contacts show signs of wear from insertion/removal from a previous phone.  The vendor did contact me to resend another battery stating new, but it showed signs of wear as well.  The battery's do work, they do hold a charge, however I still question the 'new'ness of them.  Great price though for an OEM battery.  I would likely order from them again even knowing what I know due to the price point.",4
I really needed an extra battery because I use my phone for work a great deal of the time.  This was purchased with the Docking Station Charger and it has worked out very well for me.,5
"I give one star for both batteries I purchased because they hold a charge. However the contacts on both batteries looked used! UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I REALIZED NEITHER BATTERIES WERE EVEN MADE BY HTC!!! Each battery was made by a different company, and one has a dent in it. In the description the seller says 'This battery is an original accessory manufactured by HTC.' But this is a lie.One star because they do function, but I'm pissed off because I could have got cheap import knock-off batteries with dents for cheaper on Ebay. The part numbers in the description don't even match!",1
Honestly it's okay. The screen protector scratches really easily and it doesn't help too much. I guess it's a cheap product for a cheap price.,3
The screen protectors are too big for the iPhone 4 glass. The screen protectors come off the side of the phone.,1
"It sticks ok, but in few places it gets bubbles which disturbs the display. Even after re-apply it, you still see air gaps.",3
"These protectors for the iPhone are perfect! No problems what so ever!! Quality seem just as good as your more expensive ones... Maybe they other people dont know to properly apply them?? But they fit perfect no air bubbles, clear screen... def happy would recommend and purchase again!!! Thank You!!",5
"Just make sure you apply them correctly.  They work great, just take a tad bit of time to get to you.  But I would recommend them.",5
This it really nice for the price you are getting it for. However I do not use it anymore since I got rid of it. If you are looking for a screen protector on a budget this is the one you get. Ships fast too!,5
"These covers do not stick - neither front nor back. Corners do not stick at all right from the beginning, and middle portion comes off in a couple of days. Do not waste your money on this product.",1
This product did not come cut for the iphone four. as a matter of fact it also creates more glare. CRAPY,1
"Bought for new Iphone4, Still sticking 3 months later! Love them! Stuck on really easily. Great to keep dust and prints off screen / back.",4
"This protector has bad cuts around the home button, camera, ear piece.  It is impossible to have it adhere around those because of all the imperfections.But the worst is that the front sticker that comes in the protector and is supposed to be removed after applying it, won't come off, leaves horrible glue residues.I will just leave it on the phone until I replace it, what I will do today if I can, to avoid scratches.DEFINITELY A BAD PROTECTOR!  I am so disappointed, in the past I purchased another protector with the same name, and it was acceptable.Another point that shows the unreliability of this product is that out of the 4 that I bought, they came with different cuts, though all sharing the same problems regarding the front sticker and bad cuts.  In fact I'd say it's bad even as a temporary solution...",1
"On the cover of the pack, it says bubble free and I have like 50 bubbles. It says glare free and it glares a lot! And it scratches easily.  But I still use it.",2
"Very nice product. Only down fall is not that visible in sunlight. But it does the job. Clear as a mirror, no scratching.",4
"Not that great, if you have a white iphone you will not be able to see yourself unless you have a black phone.",2
I gave all my friends of mirror sticker and I use one for myself as it sure gave us all headaches because sometime its from the reflects in the brighten. I would say it's ok!,3
"They got the job done, and I had plenty left over just in case I needed to replace the one I put on",4
I have found this product to be for protecting my iPhone 4. I really like it and would recommend it those who good protection for their iPhone.,5
Not a flush perfect fit but the quality is great. I'm glad it came with 3 because I had a hard time with the 1st. The 2nd one experienced a few practice runs. Finally got the 3rd one on ok.,4
"These are inexpensive and have the anti-glare finish, but I can never get them applied without bubbles.  Maybe it's my own fault.  I'm going to have someone at the store do one and see if they can do better.",2
"Just what I needed for my phone. It was easy to install, and fit my phone perfect, will reorder soon.",5
"These are a must to protect the I phone screens.  They are inexpensive and shipped out fast.  They do not hinder any actions with the phone, and I suggest everyone purchase screen protectors.",4
"After trying a more expensive screen protector that didn't work at all, I opted for CrazyOnDigital's less expensive anti-glare screen protector. Like many other screen protectors, this one involves removing a plastic backing then applying the protector to the screen face & finally removing the bubbles.The Pros:1) It's an exceptionally cheap price. (I only paid $4.99.)2) You get three! (Yep, 3 for $4.99.) Even with shipping, these still cost less than many other brands.3) Fairly easy to place.4) Good coverage and protection.The cons:1) There are two stickers on the protector when you take it out of the pack. The first sticker is there to tell you to remove the plastic backing. The second is to help put the protector on without touching the back. Unfortunately, the second sticker left a sticky residue on the protector when I tried to remove it. I did finally get all the goo off, but it took a bit of work to remove the residue without removing the protector from the phone.2) The protector was fairly easy to place. However, I could not get all the bubbles out. Bubbles remained on the top two corners of the phone. No amount of pressing has worked. Luckily, my case covers those bubbles, so it's not a huge issue. But if you don't have a case to cover them, then the protector would eventually come off because dirt will get under those bubbles since they're right at the edge.3) Does help cut the glare, but I wouldn't say it's 'anti-glare'.In sum, I would probably buy CrazyOnDigital's less expensive anti-glare screen protector again because you get 3 for a very reasonable price.",4
Replacement battery brought my cell phone back to like new as far as the power is concerned. I'm sorry most newer phones make it harder to replace the battery,5
"After watching the battery life of my HTC Droid Incredible diminish so that I couldn't even make it through the day without recharging, I found this OEM battery online for only six bucks.  It arrived in a padded envelope without any other packaging, but it was in perfect shape, ...and it works great!  It is *exactly* like the battery that came with the phone. Full battery life of my phone is now restored.  I can go through the whole day with about 60% battery left by the time I go to bed.",5
"Replaced the 2 year old battery in my Droid Incredible, and this one was an exact fit, lasts longer (the original was pretty beat) and I've not had any problems.",5
I actually bought this for a friend and he seems to love it so far. The results may get him to start buying online! Great battery and quick shipping,5
I have purchased replacement batteries from an auction site and had nothing but problems with them.  This battery works flawlessly.  The battery life is just like when I bought the phone new.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.,5
Identical factory replacement. No issues what so ever. I got 2 for a HUGE discount over what Verizon wanted. that way I always had a freshly charged battery.,5
"My son had bought me a wall charger and extra battery for my Droid Incredible phone so I wouldn't run out of battery at an inopportune time, but I lost the battery.  This is a replacement battery and works fine.  I take it along with me when I'm afraid my phone's battery will die, and I can just change batteries!",5
"works better than the one that came with the phone, it is now the charger i always use. very good",5
"I was sent the wrong batery,  too expensive to pay to send it back.  I would not buy batteries from this company again.  Fortunatly another vendore sent me another spare last year for my HTC 4G incredible.  I could not even giove it away:)... Shatty quality control of shipping which cost more than the item/battery.KarlaC",1
"My original battery is only 11 months old, but already the charge was slipping so I ordered this battery as a back up to have just in case. I've been using it for 2 weeks now and the battery is as good as the original used to be - let's face it, no smartphone battery is ever going to be good enough.",5
I purchased this battery as a supplement to the  one I have that does not hold a charge for along.It replaced my battery perfectly and I keep it as a back up.It fit and held a charge.,5
No issues at all with this product.  Its the same quality as the OEM one that came with my Incredible.,5
good choice,5
It is the perfect replacement to your original battery that started draining out quickly. Works perfectly like new battery and holds charge like a new one. Good decision to purchase this one at a low price.,5
"No surprise OEM replacement.  Careful about leaving your Aria/Gratia plugged in too long, the battery will overcharge and swell like a balloon.  Glad I had this extra one.",5
when I still had my HTC Aria it worked perfectly good thing I bought this at the time I needed it,5
"well what can i say, this battery works. it is the authentic htc product and it's a new battery, so here goes the rating",5
"First rated it 2 stars, and updated it to 3 stars.I currently use this brand of mirrored screen protectors for my daughter's iPod Touch 4G. It looked wonderful! However, I can't say the same for the Verizon iPhone 4G version. Unlike the iPod Touch ones, these changed the colors of my touch screen to a greenish hue. Even on the brightest setting, I could not get the rid of the green hues. I am so disappointed because these are awesome and unique screen protectors. I will continue to use the mirrored ones for iPod Touch but going to throw these way and order a clear screen protector for my iPhone. :-(February 9, 2011 UPDATE: Okay so I decided to give it one more shot before throwing them away. I thought maybe I got a defective one. So after I carefully applied the screen protector on my iPhone, I noticed the green hue was not there! Instead of green, now I had a pinkish reddish hue. It is not as noticeable as the green, so I am going to keep on using it. Before I tried the mirror screen protector, I had changed my background to a 3D gold paisley design. I believe what you are using as wallpaper reflects how the touch screen is going to look when in use. Even though my screen has a weird color hues on it, I still really like the uniqueness of this screen protector.",3
I bought these being excited about having mirror screen protectors. When I put this on my phone. It took me a bit to get all the bubbles out. Then when I have my phone locked. It's not exactly as the pictures shows as it being a &#34;mirror.&#34; Also what they don't show is that your phones screen when it is unlocked has a rainbow appearance. It's annoying and hurts my eyes. I paid 1.58 for them but still am not happy that I even purchased this item.,2
"I love this screen protector.it hold up for a long time last one lasted 6 months,the only problem is that it is thick and when you go to pull off second film it does not come off stuck with little number 2 tag,so you have to separate #2 with fingers and it sometimes gets bent ! its just a small spot on corner of screen if I would do anything it would be for co to use a stronger tab to pull off ! buy it and try it its better than the crappy iphone 4 its on !! p.s. bever buy apple products u have to jump through hoops to get help as att tells u that you must contact apple ! why if I buy a product I want store to fix problems !!",5
"Excellent Screen protector. When placed on the phone it looked awesome with the Mirror look like. But it didn't stay for more than a week. Now it looks like just a regular Screen protector, and the Mirror quality is not same as it was on Day 1. But still a good product for the Price I paid.",4
I don't recommend to anyone to buy this product. When I got them I was all exited about it and when I put the protector to my Iphone 4 I noticed that when my phone was turned on you could see like a rainbow all the time and when I was outside I couldn't see anything.,1
Mirror tint looks razor sharp on my phone. Gives a classy look and I'm getting lots of compliments on it. Was easy to install as well. I've dropped the phone a few times and the screen protector has not even scratched.,5
That rainbow effect is very annoying and hurts my eyes the only effective thing about the screen is that you can see your self in it,2
"the screen protector is very thick and peals away and scratches very easily, I don't recommend these to anyone, although they reflect very well and easy to see through.",1
"i purchase this because i have a friend who owns one but, its not the same. You will have to adjust the color on you phone in order to get a better result using and finding you apps. Seller at 1st sent me only 1 Screen protector but after contacting them they were happy to send me 3 other Mirror screen protector. Very happy with my purchase and sellerThanks again",3
"The material is good and harmless in my opinion, and acts as a scratch-free and shock-absorbent for the phone. I strongly recommend it.",5
this is horrible but then it was a cent. i have purchased other cases that were the same price but this one sucked. it was too tight and i couldnt use the top button. it freaked out eveytime i pressed it. used it for a day then threw it away. dont buy,1
"dont buy ! looks good in the package intill you put it on your phone, air bubbles form in the back and just looks horrible",1
"Little brighter than I thought, case works great - problem when trying to remove case - a little more complicated than what I like. I dont enjoy having the ends of my fingers pinched.",2
I is a nice case and not so bulkie and my daughter loves the color green so it worked prefectly.,4
"Like the title says, does not fit iPhone 4s. At least not the AT&T iPhone 4s anyway. I was super excited to get this because green is one of my favorite colors, and when it arrived the color was amazing so initially I was pleased. I noticed that it was significantly flimsier than all my other gel cases but I put it on my phone anyway. No bueno. This is the only case I've ever ordered that the mute switch was obstructed. The volume buttons didn't line up. It was just not awesome.",2
Was no what I expected. Just expected more for case. But I guess u pay for what u get :0(,1
"its clear so it looks like my phone doesn't have a case, looks really crisp and clean. i love it, the only thing is it doesn't cover the front edges of the phone all the way .",4
The back looks odd. Like the gap between the iphone and the case has oil in it. Oh well. No big loss. Spend a few extra bucks and get a flexible case.,2
"Very thin and flexible, I expected a sturdy shell. Would not really recommend unless you like the cover very thin. Iphones  are made of glass and in my opinion need more protection.",3
Fit to my iphone 4S and 4 is not good. Otherwise product is good at this price. Need to focus the quility too.,3
This cover is the good one to keep your phone. Not too expensive. Highly recommended as its also easy to charge with this cover.,5
this is a great little classic flip case and great fo protecting your ipod and iphone you can't go wrong with this purchase,5
How long do they last.All these makers claim to use leather. I have never seen leather go bad so quickly.I am still using this one after something like a year but it definitely shows signs of wear and tear.How do you call leather glued to cardboard? I have no real idea how they do it but I know what leather is supposed to feel like when worn out... Nothing remotely close to what this one looks like.Enough with my ranting.Still this case does the job of protecting my phone. They are also getting increasingly hard to find so do not pass the opportunity.,4
great product.  I loved this product so much that I'm going to order one for my 5g now. that's it.,5
Very well made. Used for about 6 months total.. was still in excellent condition when I purchased my new phone (non-iphone) Kept the iphone in very good condition. Stuff does get under the screen protector easily.. but it charges well with the case on as well.,5
"Looks nice and has cuts in proper place. Fits ok, little loose and falls down when you turn it horizontal. Grip in hand is right.",3
"I liked this product very much (good material)if you like to protect your screen when in your purse or if used to a flip phone for screen privacy....however, I wish they would make it in white/off white leather for using with white iphone and A clear plastic (or a whole) for showing apple logo. Also another whole on the flip part to be able to turn the phone off easily.",5
"Simply put, this case is junk.  It's poorly made, and the worst part about it is that the iPhone doesn't fit securely in the case itself.  If you turn the case upside down the phone will slide right out, onto the floor.  I've done that now more than once, and I tossed the case in the trash after the second time.  Luckily, my phone survived without a scratch or mark on it.  Save your money and get something better.  The old saying 'you get what you pay for', is true and really applies here.",1
"These cases are very nice and very well made and a great protector for my I phone, this is the second time I've ordered this leather case, and a great price too.",5
I purchased this leather case for iPhone 4 and it was exactly what I expected. It was classic and had rich leather. My iPhone 4 well in to it. I would like to recommend it to people who want to add style to their life.,5
"As all the good reviews say. It fits well, looks good, flap remains closed, and folds back easily. Though, I have to agree with one reviewer it should be flip down. So the camera hole isn't blocked by the flap.At anyrate, my largest complaint is, the title says &#34;&lt;u>Leather&lt;/u>&#34; flip case. In Technical details, it does say imitation. However, with something this inexpensive I personally didn't read reviews or technical details. It wasn't electronic, so... anyhoo.My biggest complaint, Title should say Imitation leather, then I would give it four stars (camera blockage when the flap is up isn't good.) There's also some minor bubbles where they folded the finished part to &#34;roll&#34; it. Around the microphone and to open up the face. It doesn't detract much, but leather wouldn't have them. (it's what keyed me off, the feel wasn't on either, but, I thought maybe it's just the grade.)Anyhoo... some would say you get what you pay for. I agree. It's a good case, fits well and was inexpensive. All kudos!",3
Came cracked :(,1
Nice case,5
i dropped my phone a bunch while having it on and my phone was kept safe. i love this product,5
"Great fit. looks good, light weight. phone is protected and you can still see the color. I would recommend this case",5
"I do have issues with the 'sweating' as others have but I'm going to either paint it or something to get rid of that. It's a nice, sturdy case and I really like the coverage I got with this.",4
"I'm using this case on my iPhone and it's great! It's incredibly durable, yet thin enough that it's still comfortable to hold the phone. Additionally, because the case is clear I can see the original design of the white iPhone right through it. Some other users report the case being very difficult to get off, I can attest to this--it is extremely difficult to remove the case once on, however, I see this as a plus for protection, the case won't pop off if you accidentally drop the phone. The case obviously scratches easily, but I'd much rather the case be scratched than my phone!",5
"came as pictured. and what are all these bad reviews? its a clear hard case, yes its going to scratch easy and yes its cheap. i buy them all the time to make bling cases. good quality and never break on me. so if your just looking for something cheap and clear to protect your phone, then here ya go. this is perfect. fast shipping as well.",5
"Exactly what I was looking for to start decoden! Clear, Protective, and easy to remove from Iphone 4. I only bought one case to try out but, I am totally going to stock up for crafting. Shipping was super fast; I had zero problem with the company at all. I would totally tell all of my crafting buddies about this phone case!",5
i liked how it looked like but i got a scratch one and i had to sent it back but i did get my refund and the guy was awesome,2
"does its job, its clear so it doesn't take away the color of the iphone, it lasted a very long time",5
"It's ok if you just wanted to protect the phone. For the price, it a good buy. Easy to put together.",4
"I use these and metal embellishments to make more protective cases. I do it as a hobby, they look great & the front protects the phone much more than just a back case.",5
"Just got this case and its pretty nice. But putting it on was a pain, I had to almost squish my phone it to finally get it to fit. Very snug fit. And once together on your phone it's nearly impossible to get it off. It almost broke when I went to take it off for the first time.",3
Good for the money.  I used it to put a picture under the back case side so it was cool.  It does scratch up easily..  I did like that this case has a hole for the home button.  Most of the clear cases I have ordered have a &#34;U&#34; shape.,4
worked perfectly for my phone and it looked really nice on.  would def buy again for my new phone.  thanks,5
The case is slippery on your hand it could easy be dropped because it does not have a grip to it however for the price its decent and it looks nice however because of the fear of dropping it i would not use it.,2
"I ordered this case so I could have a little protection from small drops, but still have the vinyl skin on my phone showing. It does both almost perfectly! I've dropped my phone from about a foot onto tile, and it protected it very well! I had to take the vinyl skin off of my phone at the sides for it to fit though. So take that into consideration if your phone has a skin or protector on the sides.",5
"This case served its purpose, i decorated it with rhinestones and it looked beautiful, im ordering a second one to cover my phone because i just bough a new phone skin",5
"i got it for my friend, she said she liked it but i've never actually seen it on her phone..so i'm taking that as it's not as great as i thought it would be.",3
The bottom of the case is just a thin piece of rubber (where you plug it in) so it gets snagged and stretched and doesn't fit very tight on the phone. I returned it because I knew that piece would be broken in no time. Go for a hard case. These rubbery ones just stretch too easily.,2
Great case for the price. I liked it so much I ordered a pink one.  the only thing is wanted the one with the circles (like shown in the picture) but the design on my are diamonds.,5
Great silicon rubber case. it is sleak and slimline but comes up over the edges of the phone for good protection.,5
"This case came as promised, and is a super protective TPU case. I am no longer using my iPhone 4S, but I still have this case on the phone. I used this case the whole time for my 4S, dropped it numerous times, and never had any issues. It is also rather thin and slick on the outside, so there was never any issue putting the phone into my pocket when using the case.",5
I love the style and it fits perfectly on my iPhone 4. I would definitely recommend anyone who is looking for a good case.,5
"It worked. Used it for about 3 months. Its the hard rubber plastic type, Good durable case to use. k",4
"I love very slim gel cases that still compliment the sleekness of the iPhone. This case was perfect for that, and it is a beautiful color and unique design. I also like that it is slim enough to still fit comfortably in my back pocket.",5
"Doesn't provide a lot of protection, but it's a nice color and has a good feel to it.  It doens't slip out of my hand easily.",5
"The color of the case is EXACTLY as shown and the case fits perfectly with my iphone 4. I love the way it feels and how smooth it feels.I would totally recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice looking, protective case.",5
really crappy case. the top button doesnt work and its not worth using. i didnt even use it for one day. it was too tight on my phone and top button started to freak out and wanted to turn off every 10 seconds. dont buy. waste of money,2
"This is a really good case. It's sleek, slim, and looks nice on my white iPhone 4. Doesn't do much &#34;protecting&#34; but it still a pretty good case for looks.",5
"This case fits an iphone 4 perfectly if you do not have a screen protector.  With the screen protector that I have on my iphone, the corner where the mute button is tends to push on the screen protector up slightly and creates a bubble.  I tried to realign the screen protector but did not work.  The solution to this problem was to put a piece of thin cardboard paper at the corner.  Other than that, it is a nice case.  Color is good.  All buttons on the phone works with the case on.",4
I bought 5 of these cases and I Love them all.  I had purchased a $30 case from Best Buy and the first time my daughter dropped her phone the screen broke (it was insured).  SO I went back and bought another case in a different style - it lasted about 3 drops before the screen broke again.  We now both have these silicon cases on our phone and they are perfect.  I have dropped my phone at least 20 times and not a scratch.  This case has just enough of a lip on the front to provide protection.  I also do not have any type of scratch guard on our iphones - just this case.  It is an inexpensive case but it works.,5
"I feel like its honestly better than a lot of cases out there. It's color is fantastic, the buttons fit over mine perfectly and the cutouts are precise. I highly recommend.",4
"i have a case that i ordered on here and i loved it so i wanted to get another one like it so i found this one. When i got it, it was not what i ordered. it was the same color but it was a hard flimsy case that doesn't protect anything and it was different. i was very disappointed that i didn't get the case in the picture so i had to order more cases.",1
"The color shown is accurate, all the holes match up to my iPhone 4s, and it really helps me keep a grip on my phone.I don't know how it would hold up to being dropped though.I have not had any problems with lint sticking to it; not anything like the silicone cases for Android phones- those would pick up everything! But not this skin/case/cover.I am happy with my purchase and am considering buying more colours.***UPDATE***SO I dropped my phone on a cement sidewalk the other day (a fit of dancing overtook me and it fell out of my pocket while twirling) and my phone is fine. I was shocked, but very, very please.It fell from about wait-level.",4
"Absolutely love this case! It is cute and definitely good for the price I paid. It took about a month to get to me, but I understand it came from Hong Kong. So, I have no complaint about it.I would recommend it to everyone who is looking for a simple but cute case.",5
"Knowing you're paying what you're paying for this case you shouldn't expect something necessarily beautiful or super protective. However, this case does better than expected in many areas. Its color is a bright cerulean blue that is more opaque than the description picture shows (it looks awesome against my black iPhone 4s.) It fits well and all buttons are protected. I love the material it's made of, it makes the case easy enough to take off the phone without too much effort while managing to not come off as flimsy. The case has been great so far, no issues here.",5
The color is great. i really loved it because its not a dark blue like it says its more like a light blue. the only thing wrong with the case is that its too small for my phone. & on the back it looks like it has water inside the case.,2
Got this and it did not even fit my phone.... I was so excited to receive this in the mail but it doesn't fit!,1
Nor frills case that fits great.  I hate sloppy cases!  this one snaps onto your phone and looks great.  Just enough protection with a good look.,5
Love this case. What you get is what you see and I am glad I purchased this case for my phone.,5
great color! i love the protection it offers and the back is more of a flat blue than a shiny blue which i like a lot. only thing i would change is it has the tab on the bottom to cover the charge port. i know theyre good for keeping dust out but i just dont prefer them. arrived early. still love the case.,5
Bought this for my husband for his new iphone but got the ottebox i bought from amazon so this went ot mother in law. She loves being able to change her cases.,5
Ok case for the price. Again not the best but what can you expect when your only dropping a few bucks on an iPhone case!,3
I didn't really like it because it turned out to be way darker tahn what I wanted it to be. It's okay and fits right though.,2
Does not look as advertised. Broke as soon as I put it on. The one corner won't stay snapped. Dirt gets under it even after mild use...,1
"First off I'm not trashing this quality wise. You get what you pay for and for $2 I wasn't expecting much. The reason I gave this case 1 star is because there is no sim card opening as shown. Other than that all the rest of the openings are in the right place. It seem to snap in place pretty good and didn't want to come apart very easily. I ordered a case with & without a sim card opening both from eForCity. I got 2 of the same case. Both w/o a sim card opening. I got this to see what it was like. I have a better case I normally use that is rubberized and this one would be for travel as it is hard plastic and can slide in a pocket easier than my normal case. I did order an Amazon basics case that hasn't arrived yet. I'm thinking I will trust my $300 phone to a better case than this one, but $2 buys a $2 case.",1
This is a great case. It's slim fitting and fits my iPhone 4 like a glove. I highly recommend this case to all iPhone owners. It covers everything and is a great quality for the price.,5
did not come as pictured! the picture shows the clear case covering the front of the phone a little bit around the camera and such. but the item that came was not that one. it was barley covering anything on the front of the phone and nothing around the camera/speaker deal. its a huge deal but i buy them to make bling cases and pretty much needed the one that was pictured.,1
"I like thin covers.  This works great in protecting without taking anything away from the phone.  My boss liked it so much, he ordered one for his phone as well.  Would order again.",5
"Decent case for the price, nothing spectacular but nice and clear.  I would buy this again and personalize it with bling.",4
"Great case, fits like a glove.  Great transaction! Will purchase from again!  What else can I say?  Love it, love it!",5
dont get this case...stays dirty cracks a lot overtime...feels cheap and looks cheap its probably cheap....but im cheap and i bought it...so there ya go...but the casecrown for like 10 bucks will last you way longer...looks better and feels great...trust me.,1
"This case was alright, When I dropped my phone, the case flew off.  I was not pleased at all with that due to the fact that my phone sustained some damaged but not as much since the case did break the fall a little.  The case is alright if you want something to protect it from scratches but does not do a very good job at protecting it from fall damage.",3
there are some wieid plastic cuts on the top of the case that turn me off.  I'd find something else.,2
These are great and last a really long time.  Great product. I would recommend to anyone who has an iphone!,5
DOES NOT even shut all the way and definitely wont do any protection on your phone don't buy waist of money!!!,2
I love how this case completely protects the edges of the phone and the front.  not just a back and side case.  i think this is the best you can get without getting an 'Outter box'.,5
"The description says that there are no risk of the case breaking open when you drop the phone...um, false. The first time it dropped, it not only fell apart, but my phone also scraped. Sad. So I have since stopped using it and currently using the rubber one I purchased at the same time. It's such a pretty design though...",3
"It's pretty but something about the make of it blocks off the speaker. So when you talk on the phone, you can barely hear the other person.I really like the design but probably wouldn't buy it again.",2
"This is a beautiful case, but the manufacturers forgot to reverse the image from front to back, so when the two sides are placed on the phone, the image on the back doesn't match with the image that carries over to the front.",3
great for the price... at the mall they get you for 20-25 a piece ... i will never go back there again for a cover... love it love it love it,5
"Great case for the money, and then some. I see these in the mall for 20 bucks. I love being able to change cases as the mood strikes. And im moody. lol. I have bought several of these. Make great gifts for everyone. Just get correct make of their phone, and you have a personalized inexpensive gift. Love these",5
I really love this cell phone case for my phone it is so pretty. I have many and love them all.,5
"Got this for my wife and she absolutely loved the design, however, the plastic is pretty flimsy and you will certainly get what you pay for.  Would recommend to someone is more interested in the design than in protecting the phone.",5
My daughter love it,5
Makes phone bulky but I knew it would be because its not a rubber case. It may break if I drop it but hey I paid $2.80 for it.,5
It's diffently worth the price.  Most cases are $15 and up.  I love the design as well!  Recommendations are in order!,4
"The case has already saved my phone. And let me same it sure is pretty case. I got it for my wife and she is loving it. In addition, the case came to my house very quickly.",5
"This case was way too big for my wives phone and we just tossed them.  I bought them as a Xmas gift and she loved the color, butwe just could not use it because it did not fit her Sprint Evo 4G, but maybe it was me. IT was too big.",3
love the case....its soft and it doesnt move after u snap it on..great....it fits perfect...easy to clean..now that sweet...love it..looking for more....,5
"I WANTED THIS CASE SO BAD,AND IT FINALLY ARRIVED ABOUT A WEEK AGO,PUT IT ON MY IPHONE & IT SNAPS ON EVERY CORNER BUT ONE!IT'S GOT A LITTLE BROKE PEICE ON ONE OF THE BOTTOM SIDES,SO IT WON'T SNAP CLOSED THE RIGHT WAY! #SAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
"I like this product, the only problem I have had is that the stones started falling off within a week. Other than that I like it very much.",3
I chose five stars because this is literally the only sparkly case that hasn't had almost every gem fall off. I've had two or three fall off but nothing a little glue couldn't fix. It's definitely not a very protective case (don't drop the phone) but I love it anyway. It's pretty and suits my taste. I always get compliments on it and for the price I paid I can't complain at all.,5
Love the bling and it's easy to put on the phone.  The sparkles have stayed on really well.  I'll purchase from this vendor again.,4
She had one like this for her iPhone 3GS. It was a wonderful surprise when this one showed up for her new iPhone 4,5
"I could tell you how I liked it if I would have got it..never came, once I get the case will let you know.",1
"Ok I ordered my case on Saturday night and had my case by Thursday. Case was in perfect condition and came in bubble wrap for protection!!! Case is super pretty and I tried it on my phone and it snapped on nice and tight- fit perfect on my Iphone 4, and I have a white iphone and it looked great with it!! Im uploadng a few pics of the case. The only thing I can say so far is the clear rhinestones give the phone a slightly grey appearance but otherwise it's perfect!!! I'll update after i've used it a while but for now, atleast, i'm giving it 5 stars. For durability it seems like every other bling case i've gotten, it'll be good for a month or two of everyday constant use and i'm pretty hard on my phone and case, and then the rhinestones will start to fall off primarily around the spots where you hold your phone to make a call. I usually buy 2 or even 3 at a time of my favorite bling cases so they last a while and atleast one non-bling case that will last for a while.",5
"YOU WILL PAY SO MUCH FOR YOUR IPHONE AND WHEN YOU PUT THIS CASE ON IT WILL MAKE IT LOOK CHEAP AS HELL, AND IF YOU DROP YOUR PHONE IT WILL NOT PROTECTE IT",1
"I LOVE zebra print, and i LOVE bling. Perfect case for me. Easy to put on your phone, and fits perfectly. Only things negative i would have to say would be one, the 'glitter sticker/glue' on the bottom part near the charger (that does not have jewels, started peeling off the first day (but for the price i am not complaining!) The second downfall would have to be that the gems on top by the ear peace are uncomfortable on the ear if you are using it for more than a couple minutes. Luckily im a texter. Great looking case though!",4
"The picture shows that this case is a snap on with two parts. However, when I received the product, it is only one part and snaps onto the back leaving the front of the phone unprotected.",1
The case is really beautiful.& it protects my phone really great.All the rhinestones are really shiny  makes my phone look nice !i loved this product it is worth your money!!!,5
It came broken-a in broken in half broken. I am very disappointed what a bummer because zebras and bling are my favorite thing.,1
"Day one I had a handful of rhinestones that fell off it. I dont even use it that much! Also the case never had a good seal, kt came apart almost every time I picked it up. Dont recommend this one at all!",1
This case is the best because it offers beauty..durability and over all just bling that goes perfect for almost any evening wear!,5
Not a fan.  It is rough and hurts your hand and ear when you are using your phone.  It leaves glitter all over the place.  I don't recommend.,2
"I have tried several other screen protectors and this one is my choice. Fit is exact and easy to install,covers entire phone screen and should last for a long time. If you need a protector for a Droid, this one will do the job. I ordered 3 for my phone and will order more if needed in the future.",5
"Well, it is the right size and it sticks to the screen, so that's two stars. One thing they are not is abrasion resistant. I was kinda hoping they would be better in that regard.",2
I wish that I could write a short review for this because there's not much to say except that it does the job,4
Came with slight marring on the film resulting in bubbles on the phone. Double checked it was not debris and it looked to be manufacturing defects. Cosmetically it was not acceptable with this problem so I removed it and threw it away. Wasted a few $ on this one.,2
I purchased two of these so that i'd have a spare and was not disappointed. Cover the whole of the screen very well and now I'm not worried that my screen is getting dinged up in my pocket with my keys.,5
"This product works perfectly! The cut is exact, and the protector is very high quality IMO. Don't pay attention to the ones that say the stickers don't come off right, they aren't supposed to! They're attached to a thin film covering either side of the actual protector, all you'll need to do is pull on the sticker and the film should come off with it. 5 stars!",5
I purchased this screen protector for my droid x. It was a perfect fit and was shipped before the date estimated.,5
The screen protector works really great!  The screen is bright and there are no big air bubbles like there was with another screen saver I used. A cleaning pad is included to clean the display before putting the screen protector on.  A great product!  I ordered 4 more for my friends and to have a couple of extra ones.  The price is really good too.,5
I loved the price and the product alot! it was very easy to put on and it arrived at my home fast,5
"Great product for the price. it arrived fairly quickly. The first one was slightly bent from the corners and didn't stick well on the screen. I contacted the seller and he timely replied and processed another screen protector right away for free. This one was in much better condition. They all are slightly smaller than the actual screen size, on there is few millimeters of area that just stays open on the long sides. But that's ok for me. I am still looking for something that's easy to apply and doesn't have any bubbles at all... ! But this product was still good for the price.",4
"for the cost, i guess its was worth a monster energy drink, it stayed on my phone for a whole minute. The old saying 'you get what u pay for'",1
"I have used these protective screens before, some from my phone provider and others from other stores. This protector was missing it's inside layer, and was too large for my phone. It failed miserably... Buy it from a store so you can put it on there and know it fits...",1
"This is too tight a fit for Droid 2 Global! I regret buying this item, because unlike my previous case where the phone effortlessly slides in and out, the phone in this case doesn't slide out easily :-(",1
"This was a throw-in to a larger purchase.  I never ended up using this, but it was a nice, if not slightly cheap, looking case.  I did have a bulky case on my phone which made it not fit as easily",3
"I was hesitant to purchase this case because it was so cheap, but when it arrived I was blown away by the quality of the case!  It is as nice or nicer than the cases you will pay over $20 for at Verizon.  Totally worth the purchase!",5
It was a great fit for the first few weeks but of course after everyday use it did become much less secure than I was comfortable with so I discontinued using it. For the price I guess it was worth it.,4
My Husband was looking for a pouch to hold his droid 2 global with a silicone case on it that wouldn't let the phone slip out every time he moved. This was perfect I was a little wary at first because i noticed that many of the sellers believe the droid 2 and the global are the same size they're not. He is satisfied with this case and it attached on his duty built very easily.,5
Just right for my Droid 2 Global...very nice looking case that is a perfect fit for my phone. Thanks so much!,5
"Surprisingly, held my Droid 2 Global with Otterbox case installed. Stays on a belt with snap flap, though was a bit hard to use.  D2G will sometimes try to be in car dock mode I assume from the magnetic closure flap.  Can be a bit hard to slide out of the case with the case already on the phone, but I feel the extra protection of the Otterbox case is worth the extra effort.  Found that there is an opening in the bottom middle I can push up on to start to get the phone out much easier than trying to grasp it from the top edges.",5
very happy with this case. better than the last two i have bought. like the extra snap hold on the belt no chance of losing case while out on the town.,4
loved this item and that it came with two gave one to a friend only down fall white gets very dirty def recommend though,5
"I really enjoyed this cover case. The color was very beautiful, and it fit my Iphone perfectly. It was a very nice case for me.",5
You can't beat this deal for the price. My wife loves it and gets lots of compliments. All ports are available and fit perfect.,5
good case. Got really dirty fast.  Was cracked in like the first week. And signal kept going in and out,3
I gave this to my beautician as a gift. She loved it. She told me that has dropped she hers numerous time without incident,5
"I like the design on it, this is why I bought it.but ,it peels off really fast. won't buy again, didn't really like it",2
"Hey, it's less than $5 so what did I expect?  The pink/purple isn't all that vibrant - I think the picture is nicer than the reality.",4
I loved how this case looked in my white iPhone. Just was sad how quick the white got dirty so quick:0(,4
Fits good that is the main thing for me. very prettyperfect colors true colors very bright. I like therubber feel it is not plastic. sturdy,5
"When I received the item, pieces of the flower decoration were already peeling off. Each time you put it in/take it out of your pocket or even set it on the table, more pieces of the decoration were peeling off. After having it for a day, my cover was completely white. -_-",1
This is a great case for your phone the only thing that i don't like about it is that if you put it in your pocket is will change colors.  But other than that it's a wonderful case,4
"This phone case was absolutely horrendous. As soon as I opened the package, the design started to flake off. I ordered a new one and the same thing happened! Don't waste your money.",1
The graphics seem to be be pretty good quality.  No bling to fall off.  I like this case overall and use it a lot.,4
"For the money cant beat it. White became dirty very easily and doesnt come clean but for the price, cant beat it.",4
I like this cover much better than the others I've tried.  It blends in with my white phone quite beautifully..,4
I bought this for my aunt and she absolutely loves it. She has not had any problems with it. People ask her all the time where she got it from.,5
"Kept my phone super safe, I dropped it on cement and it never once cracked or broke, I am very happy with this phone case & would definitely order again!",5
Ordered this and others that are more for the girly side of me...I work in a factory and not able to show this side of me,5
I used this product for just little but before i changed to a different case. it worked well until i went back to put it on again to use and the case would not snap back in to hold together. now it's just sitting in my closet taking up space. i'm not too worried about it because it was cheap in price but it was disappointing to not being able to use it again.,2
"Shipped immediately to me, this usb cord is worth way more than I paid. Very good quality.  Excellent customer service as well. Excellent Value and Product",5
Been using for a year and a half to charge and transfer data with no problem. Not sure if others got a bad cable but mine works great.,5
I bought this because i wanted to root my kindle fire and it works perfect and is a great cord and it has an unbeatable price! the only thing that pissed me off is that it took FOREVER to be delivered it came in like 9 days that pissed me off but the product itself im very happy with it and it works perfect!,5
"Technically it still works but the black outter shell has come out of either end and can now see the wires within, this does NOT pose any chance for shock or fire as the internal wires are coated as well.",3
Gives me a extra cable to connect my phone to charger and computer. Stronger stiffer cable than I usually get.,4
"My old flip phone was behaving strangely, so I needed an upgrade.  But I was not looking to sign up for a new two year contract with AT&T.  I am retired and stay at home most of the time...the cell phone is not used that much...as a matter of fact, I have 5000 unused rollover minutes at the present.  I would not make much use of a smartphone, and I certainly didn't want the extra cost that AT&T charges for the their data and messaging plans.  But I did want to be able to send text messages to the kids if necessary and the old phone did not have a qwerty keyboard and as an old man, I couldn't negotiate the old style keyboard very well.  So I was looking for an unlocked Phone that would work on the AT&T network and that had a qwerty keyboard.  The Nokia C3 fit my needs perfectly.  And so far, it seems to be of excellent quality...I have always had good results with Nokia and this one is no exception.  The voice quality is great. I did have to go through a learning process, but I have almost mastered the basic needs that I have.  I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for something short of a smartphone.",5
"I have had one of these exact phones for over 2 years and I'm very happy with it. My wife wanted a new phone to replace her old Motorola flip phone, and I asked her if she'd like to get one like mine. I use Consumer Cellular as my provider, and bought mine from them originally, but they no longer offer this phone, the Nokia C3-00. I tried buying her a Samsung smartphone, but it sucked the battery down in less than 2 days even with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Maps, etc. and other power hungry functions turned off. Also the Smartphone for some reason started using up my very limited data allowance I have with Consumer Cellular. I saw the Nokia C3-00 offered by Amazon as a brand new, unlocked phone for 110 bucks, so I jumped on it. When it arrived, I charged up the battery, put the SIM card in from my wife's other phone, and there it was. The greatest things about this phone are its simplicity and battery life. After charging my own C3-00, I usually get 8 days out of it with moderate use before the battery indicator goes from 4 bars to 3 bars, but I charge it again at 3 bars. The voice clarity is great too. Texting is fairly easy as it does have a QWERTY keyboard with alpha numeric and symbols. We are not big &#34;texters&#34; by any means, and I'm not sure if a &#34;power texter&#34; would like this, but maybe they would. It gets the job done. I did check the warranty status of the phone on Nokia's website, and the serial number came up as &#34;out of US warranty&#34;, but emails back and forth from Amazon customer service says that my Amazon invoice as buying this as a new phone here in the US would cover it as being under warranty. I hope to never have to find out. The phone is brand new; it's just that these phones were produced and sold mainly in 2010 and 2011 I think. I guess this is what they may call &#34;old new stock&#34;?The firmware version of mine and my wife's phone is 3.65, and Nokia's OVI software suite when connected to the phone, says there is no newer version available for the phone. One more thing: both our phones have no obvious Wi-Fi connection choice under &#34;Settings/Connectivity&#34; menus. Love the phone anyway for the pluses I mentioned, and for me, there really are no negatives at all. It has all the features mentioned in Amazon's specs, but for email, I really do not remember seeing a &#34;dedicated email&#34; key, but email is doable under messages where you write a message, and then chose &#34;mail&#34; instead of &#34;number for the intended recipient. It may have been there before I customized the display layout and shortcut key assignments: yes, just checked it, and it is assignable as a shortcut to one of the keys.",5
"The phone is light and has great battery life. The screen is clean and easy to read and the buttons are great if you text a lot (not like the Samsung phone I replaced with this one.) The camera is as expected, just a novelty, don't expect to get good pics, just mediocre. I like the phone ok, no real issues. The thing is that I don't think, for me, it is worth the price. I would rather pay a little more and have more functionality. This phone is pretty basic and the price is not bad, but again, I am going to apply my refund to something with more features, like touch screen and a larger screen. Really, I'd like something I can download apps AND have the great functionality of a Nokia, so gonna search for something that fits my need and my budget, but for me, this phone wasn't it.",3
"This Cell Phone is the best thing Nokia to Made. Phone of this quality do not currently. I wanted to buy the same phone but they sell very expensive and there are few options. the current price is more than double that buy, this is a phone that sounds good has excellent signal so I can use it anywhere in my home. It is excellent I recommend it.",5
"I bought the Nokia C-3 because I needed something better than the .6 MP camera on the X2. At first, I loved the C-3 for everyday use, browsing, and taking pictures.First, the speaker imploded and started struggling to play music or ringtones through the distortion. That was tolerable, I suppose.Secondly, and this did the phone in, the casing began to peel off. At first, I thought maybe it was just plastic from when I bought it that was peeling off. But then it started cracking and the paint chipping.Nokia seems to be giving up, at this point. What used to be a manufacturer of reliable, inexpensive phones now makes expensive, unreliable phones. The C-3 and N8 have both been nightmares for me. I have spent over $1000 on Nokia phones that are now useless.",1
"This cell phone is just ok. Really. It has a reasonable amount of the features most smart phones has. It does not have a good camera or flash. The keyboard worn out after three months. But the worst is having to deal with NOKIA customer service. I had such a bad experience, which contrasts so much with the experience I had with Nokia customer service in Europe.",3
"I highly recommend if you only use this for calls and texting. Do not use for internet because it does lag. I gave this 3/5 stars because texting does need to get some getting use to. Keys are somewhat small-medium size and if you have stubby fingers like me you being to text slow at first then normal afterwards.Don't get me wrong, this is a great little phone. It comes with Wifi which is awesome btw! Only get this if you really want it. I am sure you can get touch-screen phones at about the same price. I find those types of phones easier to use for texting and surfing the web. that's just my opinions though.",3
"I bought this phone to replace my Nokia 6300 (another great nokia phone). No complaints at all! Great connectivity, great photos....another satisfactory product from Nokia",5
"I purchased the Nokia C-300 back in November, 2011. When I first got it, it often froze up and shut off. Got frustrated but after a few days it stopped. Now occasionally it freezes but doesn't bother me as all phones of mine did this (Nokias, that is). It's decent on the internet, and you can do a lot with this phone. I do e-mail and chat. The only other downside is getting pictures messages, which I can't seem to get, but T-mobile won't help me as this phone isn't supported. Another tolerable thing, though. But if you are constant texter: Beware! The keys chip very badly and it's hard to see the numbers/letters. I ended up purchasing another phone for this reason.. but other than that, phone worked fine. Also, the great thing about this phone is the battery life. I am a huge texter and caller and I go 3 days easily without a single charge.",4
"I bought this Nokia Phone because I had aonther one but this one must have been defective, the battery does not pop out, so even with tools could not work that out. So I returned the phone, it was impossible to get the battery out to change sim cards. I mainly buy unlocked cell phones not only to use in the USA but outside the country, so the battery has to be easy to remove to reach the sim card and change it, sometimes I have to do it between planes. Other than that the phone was nice and the seller nice to deal with.",3
"Let me begin my review by saying I have had all types of phones: brick, flip, Android & iPhone smartphones, and I always come back to Nokia. The C3 in particular has been my favorite. I realized after trying everything that all I really needed was a basic phone to make calls, send texts, and that would not be an energy hog requiring additional chargers in the car, office, home, etc. I also needed the flexibility to roam internationally and thus needed a multi-band GSM phone.Pros:Excellent battery life;Screen easy to read, large/vibrant for a basic phone;Full keyboard with raised buttons that illuminate;2.0 MP camera;FM radio;Great call quality and signal strength;Multi-band and unlocked for international roaming;STURDY, metallic back, heavy, no need for a case or protective cover;Wifi (not the fanciest web browser or at all comparable to a smartphone but it does work in a pinch).Cons:Limited choice of ringtones/themes/wallpapers;The speaker on the phone is quite sensitive, and many people whom I speak with say that my phone picks up all background noises and amplifies them;Software bugs--the 'conversation view' of text messaging, while in theory is a cool feature, does not work properly despite software updates. The messages themselves are linked to the wrong sender. Avoid using this feature and just read messages from your inbox or sent box.And that's pretty much all I can think of! For $100 you can get a brand new, high-quality phone that is great for even heavy texters, and no need to spring the additional $20-30 a month on a data plan. **Note: The only thing that may present a problem is that because this phone is unlocked, you will need to sort out your data/MMS/internet settings with your carrier. On my phone, I only activated MMS (through AT&T; tech support, but you can also find online) and disabled data for the other features, so I would not incur any additional or surprise charges.**",4
"Firstly, it's a great price for an unlocked phone that can be used with AT&T;, TMobile, prepaid, and any other GSM (SIM card) service providers worldwide. I'm not going to repeat the technical specifications. It is very light, portable and has excellent battery life. You can talk for a really long time. Make sure to turn off WIFI when it's not being used. This phone is perfect for everyday use, or as a backup or a second phone. I love the FM radio.It also makes a decent gift.I would recommend it over any carrier branded phone. It is always cheaper in the long run to get an unsubsidized phone.",5
"When you first pick up the Nokia C3, you can think that you have a modern looking full QWERTY Blackberry. It is a cool looking phone, with a very easy to use keyboard.Its light weight, so it dosent feel heavy in your pocked, has great battery life. The sound clarity is good, as is the camera. Its not a high end camera phone, but its pictures are just as clear as my old 8900.It dosent compare with the high end smart phones like the new Blackberries or HTC androids, but for the $160 range that its in, it certainly gives you that expensive look, and is a great email/messaging device.",5
"This is a great product.  It's small, but feels solid in your hand.  Has a GREAT battery.  I text a lot and I was used to having to charge my battery daily.  With this phone, the battery lasts AT LEAST two days, and that's with heavy texting and limited internet usage.  Well constructed.  Shows conversational style text.  You can attach ringtones and photos to your contacts.  You can set up recurring appointments. It has an alarm which works really well. You can use up to an 8GB micro SD card with it.  If you have AT&T; service (which I do) you need to know how to configure it so that you can receive multimedia (picture) messages and access the internet. I have the instructions for the configuration, which I will enter below.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good phone, but doesn't want to pay for a 'smart phone'. You can get unlimited data (internet) usage for $10/month (again, AT&T;) versus $25/month for what they consider to be a 'smart phone'.  Okay, it isn't blazing fast on the internet (uses Edge rather than 3G or 4G), but it's fast enough for me.  I don't actually use it for the internet a lot because I prefer to use my computer for that.  Multimedia messaging works great. It does everything I want it to do and I've been used to using the Samsung Blackjack II and Jack. I've been a cell phone user since 1995.  Again, I highly recommend this product.

"Great little phone just what I needed a non-smart phone with wifi. It is used on at&T; with no data plan and photo turned off on the account can't send photos because you would need the att internet services turned on to do this, so NO web service thru ATT, I just use HOT Spots or home networks for the web and email. the only service used thru att is phone and text. This phone does not have GPS tracking = Non-smart....1.Also has a built in FM receiver.2.Yes it has Bluetooth.3.It loads web pages Not like a Iphone it's on the slower side but good enough for me.4.Good battery life.Hope this helps",5
"I am a bit skeptical when ordering things like this, especially for such a cheap price - after all you typically get what you pay for.  This film really is a good bargain though, as it is very inexpensive and works very well.  I had no problems getting the film on front or back and with only minimal maintenance to remove any bubbles.  All the cut outs for the camera's and such were perfect as well.  I would definitely buy this again as it does what it says and fits well, and at such a reasonable price there is nothing to lose.",5
"I have been buying screen protectors for as long as I've had a mobile device in my hand. I love it when you peel off a screen/otherwise protector and your device looks as if it just came out of the box, while you trash your gauged and scratched protector. A job well done right?I bought these protectors from my mom after I had installed the splash ones on her iPhone4 (verizon). She complained of a 'rainbow effect' when light hit the screen. Sure enough, there were mixes of colors emanating from the surface screen (green, violet,blue). And not to mention, the splash cover's front protector kept scratching myyyy ear every time I talked on the phone.So knowing GT Max's line of apple accessories (bought a protective keyboard mat for my macbook) I have come to rely on them as far as protecting my cherished electronic devices. We bought the item for 82 cents? And maybe a dollar shipping and it came in the mail almost the next day! The covers were front and back protection for the iPhone4 (same as the splash ones) but at a fraction of the cost. There was no gooey residue or adhesive and they were easy to install.There are no glares, no oily screens, no rainbow effects, no orange-peel feeling... Just a smooth, form-fitting screen protector at a great price. That's what I like about this product. It's simple, It does what it says its made for, and its price is justified! Highly recommend getting these before buying a more expensive alternative.",5
Such a good product. I recommend it to anyone looking for a front and back cover to their iPhone. XD,5
so thine and not strong ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ah not so good,1
"This ended up being kind of like the anti glare screens where they feel dull and make your screen dull, except worse, they were splotchy/rippley and kind of mirror-esque. Needless to say, it didn't make for an easy viewing of the phone's true colors. I also had issues with it sticking. I got my money back, though, so there is the up side.",1
"Product shipped fast and was as advertised.  Simply wipe down your screen with the cloth so it is clean, line up the protector with the backing partially off, apply, and push out any bubbles.  Will buy another from this GTMAX vendor when any scratches on the protector irritate me enough to buy another one :)",5
"GOOD pricing, i got 5 of these, they look good, no scratches, everything like it should be.BUY this one.",5
Good simple screen protector for not a lot of money. Didn't bubble up on my phone and didn't allow glare as bad as some do.,5
work perfectly !! easy applicaton and fingerprint resistent ! minimal bubbles once i adjusted the protector . excellent purchase for the price . veryyyy pleased !!,5
It's perfect. For the price I paid it works fine. I'll be buying more when I need a new one on my phone,5
"'You get what you pay for'I have used top of the line, military grade screen protectors, and I have used products like these.Let's be real, this isn't invisiSheild protection here, it doesn't have a unique feel or anything.It is a very generic, (hundreds of similar products on Amazon) plastic screen protector for the front and back.**THE GOOD**The front works very well, I have had my iPhone 4 in my pocket with keys, and the screen protector doesn't even look hurt.It's cheap.**THE BAD**The back protector doesn't cling on as well as the front. It's expected though, if you have a case, it is taking most of the friction. Mine wants to peel off when I remove my case. The back is full of air pockets, despite careful application.Putting these on can be confusing. Just make sure you read the instructions and do it carefully.----All in all, it's worth it if you don't want a insanely priced missile proof screen protector. These will protect your screen from key scuffs and other light wear. Anything heavier, I recommend going a little higher on the money.",3
"i generally don't suck at putting screen protectors on, but idk what was up with this one. i had 2 bubbles, didn't like it, then my greedy self tried again and tried other 'tips', then rage quitted and got at least 20 mini bubbles. ugh. aside from the bubbles, i like how clear it is, but i feel like i'm better off not using the screen protector at all. :/ i just got it today, so maybe my opinion will change over the next few weeks/months. next time, im ordering a cheap one that gives me multiple chances to screw up... a 3 or 6 pack. yeahh",2
For the money you how can you complain about these screen protectors. If you take the time they work just as well as the expensive ones sold at your local Verizon store.,5
"these were great they went on smoothly, you need to be careful and do it right but we like them",4
This was again a value by at very reasonable price. Though the product lacked the branded reflection and leaves few bubbles on the screen. But not that bad on price like this....,3
Arrived on time.  Although I was excited to have a back screen protector it was supper bubbly and I could not get them to go away. I have a matte screen protector on the front of mine already so I gave this one to a friend and it was also really bubbly.,2
"My screen protectors came within 4 days. Came extremely quick, faster than expected. i placed the back screen protectors on, it sticks but kind of comes off easy. Left behind a few bubbles once placed down but not bad for the price!",4
Great screen protector! It's a must have!!!!,5
it was an ok product for only a couple of weeks that is lasted. the material peeled off on its own. the protection wasn't as good as the one I had before this while at the same time it was very dark to see the screen for myself.overall i didn't like the product and removed it because it was very annoying.I'm going to have to purchase another one elsewhere...,2
"Like the quality of the screen, but it was not the correct size. Service was great and the process was quick.",5
I really like this screen and I'm afraid it works a bit too well.  I am not able to see the phone in bright sunligt.  But neither can anyone else!!! So it works really well. Glad I ordered it.,5
I love how this screen protector really protected my phone. I just wish it protected the screen but also be less noticable.,5
"I had a privacy screen for my Blackberry and it totally protected your privacy when looking at the phone from an angle. This particular privacy protector didn't give me as much privacy as I was expecting. However, it is a great screen protector and I guess its a good balance, as I can touch all my home buttons at the bottom. So I guess you can't just have every wish you desire!! Overall, great protector and its not too dark that it makes your phone really dark. Still would buy another one if I had to do it over again.",5
"This dealer is awesome and describes the product they sold perfectly. It's worth the price, I suggest buying a lot and since they are so cheap. That way if you have scratches on your screen protector you won't feel bad replacing it. Cheap price, high quality product.",5
"It does block the view from the sides and does increase privacy. If you are a member of some clandestine organization,the federal government, or clinically paranoid this is the screen protector for you! If you are fairly 'normal' , use your phone for games, movies, reading, texting, video calls or any of the normal functions everyday people use their phone for; then pass on this. I can say anything truly negative about it, except it isn't for everyday use by everyday 'normal' people. However, it gets one star for the loss of screen resolution, and the fact that it is not cut to fit the screen of the EVO 4G.",1
"i love the screen it makes it very private and i dont have to worry about coworkers and/or my kids seeing my personal information on my phone, however when in the sun it's hard to see pics and share anything that i may want to.  the screen is so dark it appears black in the sun.",3
"You have to buy these.  They have a dark tint, there is no glare and no finger prints! I love it and you will too. The only suggestion I have is, the screen protector should not cover the front camera lense. I had to cut my protector when I realized taking self portraits come out blurry.",5
This is a pretty good screen protector for the price of only $3! It has it's pro's and con's however after only a couple hours of having it.PROs- Does indeed offer privacy for phone compared to regular screen- Thick and durable- Easy to put onCONs- Peals easily- Minor bubbles under protector- Kind of makes the phone harder to see even for the owner- Doesn't offer 100% protection from people looking into your conversations,4
i love it. wish i still have it. i would recommend for people to get it. i liked everything about it. i have nothing negative to say.,5
I have this on my phones' screen and people to the side of me have a hard time seeing what I'm looking at. They ask me why I'm looking at my phone while It's off and I laugh at them. I simply show them that It's the privacy screen protector and they're amazed!,5
"This is the second one i brought, and it's better than the first. Well for me anyway because the first was really dark, during the day i couldn't even read a text. This one ids not very dark, but it does have a way of making things blurry for on lookers. yes i tested it lol. i guess if they try very hard they can read it, but that would take a lot of focus and by then you would know TRUST!!!FYI I PURCHASED THIS FROM  Boho Tronics, WILL PURCHASE AGAIN IF THIS ONE STARTS TO PEAL, BUT THAT TOOK OVER A YEAR TO HAPPEN.",5
It does a very good job of protecting my screen from damage but it is not really dark enough for complete privacy but it does help.,5
This didn't do what it was suppose to and it kept falling off!! Definitely not something that I would get again.,1
This product was just ok.  The screen protectors were kind of cheap feeling so therefore I was not thrilled about them.,3
I used this product to ensure my employees wouldn't be reading my email or texts messages over my shoulder. Works great,4
"I like the price of the screen protector but when you apply them the 2nd label would not come off and when it did I tore it and had to use oil to remove the sticky backing of the label.  In addition, lots of bubbles appear on the screen.  Overall, it protects as it says it does with those minor hiccups.",3
"doesnt really protect any privacy at all. can still see the screen from all angles, and it dims the screen. good for protecting your screen but not good for protecting your privacy!",3
"We have two Droid X's; along with this one, I also ordered the 'Black Rubberized Snap-On Protector for Motorola DROID X Xtreme MB810 (Verizon)' [...]. Because with shipping, ordering both only came to [...], I figured why not.As it turns out, both products are exactly the same; they came together in the same box with the same model number on the plastic packages from the same company, Eforcity.One of them fit the Droid X perfectly, the other does not fit so well, it's loose on one corner and getting worse after a week's use. I would say it may be hit or miss when buying these products. The problem is that with this price, it's not worth the time and trouble trying to return them. Still, I did get one good one for [...], so not a bad deal in the end.",3
Only had this case for about a month and it broke. I guess you get what you pay for. There was nothing that was done wrong with this case for it to break. It was of poor quality.,1
Okay so I gave it a four star only because if your like me and like to switch up the look of your phone or use the hd dock you need to be able to take the case off but I saw I had to bring out the tools sheesh I thought for a minute I was going to have to go into my cartoon mode and bring out the hammer lol.  Overall I dig the slick look of it and the way it protects my phone trust me when I say it is a good product for the cost. Overall will still do buisness with this company. In addition to this if you are curious about if your package will arrive on time I cant speak for you but I did recieve my package within the time it adviced so no worries there you will get the product.,4
"This snap on case fits well, it's easy to take off if you ever need to, and it allows easy access to all the buttons. I also love how it has a smooth non-sticky feel to it, as a rubber case. I highly recommend this product, especially at this price! I'm glad I didn't buy the $20 cases that are offered at stores.",5
"I liked this case so well that I bought two more at this price, just for backup. Actually, I have had trouble opening the case to remove the battery, and did some minor damage to it when I removed it. It is quite difficult to remove, and I wouldn't recommend it if you frequently use a backup battery or switch SD cards. But you can't beat the fit of this case for the money, and it arrived in just a couple of days. Goes on easily, seems to protect the device well. It does make the buttons a LITTLE harder to press for those with larger fingers, but it's worth it for the coverage near those button areas, in my opinion. An excellent base case. Perhaps you can do better for $20 or more, but I haven't tried those expensive options. It adds very little to the product size, seems to protect the Droid X very well, and keeps it tacky enough to feel good and slippery enough to put in my pocket. Pretty close to the feel of the naked Droid X, only slightly thicker.",5
Not much to say here except for the money this case cant be beat. It fits fine and all button are easily accessible. It will protect well from scratches but dont expect much for impact protection. It has a velvety rubberized feel. Slides in and out of pockets with ease. This case very closely resembles the amzer case. Dont forget to get some screen protection. I use the splash masque screen protectors. This case has a raised lip around the screen but no cover for the screen.,4
This is a great way to protect the screen of your cell phone.  It is easy to apply and virtually invisible when in place.  I don't worry about fingerprints or scratches anymore.,5
"This screen saver is nice because it actually bonds to the screen almost like it's glued on even though it's not and it will not scratch since it is more like a hard rubber than a plastic. It does have a slight tacky feel but that goes away after a while, some people might not like that if they slide their fingers when they text but I don't see that as a drawback. I've owned many other brands of screen savers and this is the only brand I'll get again.",5
"I have been using ZAGG InvisibleSHIELD products for a couple of years now and have it on several devices I own.  When it came time to protect my Droid X's large, beautiful screen, I only thought of one screen protector.  I eventually figured out that ZAGG isn't optimal for touch screen devices.PROS:- Decent protection- Can be inexpensive with discount codes- Lifetime warranty- Good customer serviceCONS:- Distorts screen clarity- Tacky surface creates too much friction- Can be difficult to installI had the dubious responsibility of installing several different types of screen protectors on Droid X's.  One came out as clear winner.  Unfortunately, it wasn't the ZAGG.INSTALLFirst of all, I have always disliked ZAGG packaging.  They keep changing it and they're still a pain to open.  If you have never installed this type of screen protector, then you will probably have a very hard time installing it so it would be a good idea to watch their install videos.  After having installed about 10 ZAGG screen protectors, I have a good sense of what works.  If you don't do it right, you can actually damage your InvisibleSHIELD during installation.  My biggest advice during install is to use the liquid solution generously and wipe up the excess right away.  Also keep a can of compressed air handy.  The bummer about this type of screen protector is that you have to wait 12-24 hours for it to cure and for your device to dry.PERFORMANCEI have never had a device's screen get scratched or damaged while being protected by an InvisibleSHIELD.  So ultimately, it does work.  But, for touch screen devices, I find the tacky feel to be less than ideal.  It creates a lot of friction and makes swiping on the screen more difficult than it should be.  Additionally, I found that it actually compromises the clarity of the screen.  I did a direct comparison between a Droid X with a ZAGG and one with a different screen protector and it was a stark contrast.  Also, the InvisibleSHIELD retains impressions.  My wife's Droid X with an InvisibleSHIELD on it looks terrible now.  As soon as she gets tired of it (she's not as picky as me), I'll be replacing the ZAGG.WARRANTY & SUPPORTZAGG does actually have a great warranty and good support so kudos for that.  Whenever I've needed a replacement, they have sent them out and it's easy to do using their website.  Unfortunately, they charge you $4 for the shipping and handling.ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTSBesides the ZAGG, I tried two other products for my Droid X.  I tried the 3-pack of protectors from Verizon and the splash Masque.  I'll say it right now that the splash Masque is the best.  It was crystal clear, fairly easy to install, and the least expensive!  I can't recommend the Verizon one at all.  Though it is basically the same as the splash Masque, it is cut to the dimensions of the display only and not the screen.  The splash is cut to the entire screen.  The splash is also cut closer to the edges than the ZAGG.  The ZAGG still leaves quite a bit of room which is annoying.  I got a lot of dust buildup around all four edges when using the ZAGG.SUMMARYThe ZAGG is still a nice product for certain devices, but generally overpriced.  For touch screen devices like the Droid X, the ZAGG interferes too much with screen clarity and impedes the use of the touch screen.  I personally prefer screen protectors like the splash Masque for my Droid X.",3
"their strong, easy to put on and protect the screen very well, i'd buy these again and i'd also reccommend these to others for their cell.",5
"Love having invisible shields on all my phones, as a mobile phone sales and repair gal, I used these all the time for both mine and customers' phones. I highly recommend this product to protect from scratches.",5
"Unit actually looks pretty good but after using it for a couple of days, I decide putting my phone in my pocket actually create less convenience for me.  Palm does not really make a pocket case for the Pixi Plus but the ones from Blackberry actually work very well.",3
"Safely holds the Pixi safe from harm. Clips to almost anything, and has a secure strong spring. Nice texture on the surface.",5
"Merchandise came quickly and delivered exactly as promised. Great price and service. Comes in 2 parts, holster clip and shell case. Shell case goes into the holster and I find that genius, very well protected. I would give the item a 5 star but I knocked off 1 for the shell case does not fit the Pixi perfectly. It's like just a little too tight and it pops just a little bit out either side. Always have to keep pushing the phone back into the case so that it is flushed. Small quibble considering the price. Once the phone is in the holster it's a non-issue.",4
"Well if you are still using that little phone these are great, very strong and hold on to your belt .",5
"I bought this because I was tired of fishing in my purse for my Palm Pixi Plus. It fits just fine on my belt loop & my Pixi slips right in. I feel that the plastic isn't very sturdy. I haven't had a problem yet but it just feels so very frail. I handle it with care for fear of cracking it. Another reason it misses that last star is because you can't rotate it on the clip. That is a personal thing that I like and I know it won't matter to most folks.Overall, I am comfortable recommending this holster to anyone.",4
Received the case/holster. It fits the pixi plus like a glove and offers a godd protection for the screen which is faced inwards. Very easy to remove and reinsert.,5
Protection is great for face of phone.Clips to belt well.Had another for over a year and it did not break.,5
"I leave case on phone.  It is still thin enough to easily fit in shirt pocket.  Belt case works well, but I seldom use it as prefer thin phone in pocket rather than on belt.",5
"I have the clear/silver color of this. This is just the same. Sturdy, and with stood my abuse. the gems held on and where not coming off at all.",4
"I had this case for one day, and the bottom right corner seamed to be broke, so it would not snap together! I will not be buying this product again. Very dissapointed!",1
"I love this case,  it fit well on my phone , very pretty , its been almost a monrh andl is holding up good ,thank  you.",5
"Beautiful, and all crystals were there, no chips cracks nothing, it was perfect. I bought it as a gift for my mother and she was ecstatic when she saw it.",5
"I have purchased these same cases before... although not sure they are from the same seller.  The case did not fit my phone like all the other cases.  It almost fit, but not enough to snap completely together and fit.  So I have used just the back cover and that doesn't work so well (i know i should have returned it).  Boo I used to get soooo many compliments on my cases identical to this!  Oh and did I mention it wasn't the exact same as the pic???  Yep.",1
It was nice to get the installation key with the case but the gas is very dull looking.  The 'rhinestones' have not luster to them are basically shaped bumps on the exterior of the case.  Don't look for bling with this case - it's eye catching because of the pattern but not for the shine.,3
Cant say enough good things about these inexpensive phone cases from amazon. Just be careful to order correct phone model. Too much money to send back such an inexpensive item. But they fit well. Very fashionable too. I get lots of compliments on this one.,5
"This case is fantastic and I even got a plastic crowbar because once it snaps, its secure. Usually with cases like this, we get our nails and toothpicks to pop the case open should we decide to change. So it's convenient to have that mini-crowbar. This case overall is FABULOUS and the bling-bling makes the case looks so rich and full and vibrant. love this case!!",5
"I received this case the other day and so far I'm very happy with the product.  I had ordered two other EVO cases at the same time as this one.  This case was the last to arrive which bummed me out a little but still I can't really complain about that.  The case is beautiful, prettier than it looked on the computer and so far the gems are staying on nicely.  The case itself appears to be white with a silver 'sticker' covering it, the gems are attached to the sticker with glue.  The other case I purchased at the same time as this one arrived right away and seemed to be made the same, with a similar silver 'sticker' with the gems also glued to the sticker; however, on the other case I ordered the sticker was not completely glued to the case around the edges and the gems started falling off as soon as I took it out of the plastic.  This case is a much better quality product.  I have even picked at the sticker a little and the gems to see if they would fall off easily and I would have the same problem with this case as I'm having with the other case, but the sticker and the gems are not coming off.  They really seem to be attached very well and I have not lost a gem yet!  (Nearly all the gems on the top part of the other case I purchased have fallen off and it's been about a week.)  I'm extremely happy with the quality of this product.  I've noticed that some of the other reviews have stated that their gems were falling off upon delivery so I guess it just depends of the batch the case comes from, etc.  In any event I've very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this product.",5
"Bought one of these for my daughter and she loves it, definitely will buy her another.  Very durable and strong.",5
"I am very very pleased with this case I love it very much, pretty colors in it. Love it very much.",5
I have HTC EVO n fits like a glove. Great case but if your expecting traditional pink like I did because of the picture;the case is more of a hot pink. Very fashionable though!,4
A few jewels had fallen out of it when I got it but other than that it was a great buy,5
Case came just as depicted in the photo and it stood up to my bad habit of dropping my phone for a few weeksIt came apart a couple of times but has protected my HTC EVO from my klutzy fingers without losing any of the rhinestones,4
"this case is not only super cute, also very affordable, and has the toughness to last through every day bumps, and dings. i purchased this as a gift for my mom, who is an RN in a critical care unit floor of the hospital, and has had this for 2weeks now and still hasn't had any problems with rhinestones coming off, or colors fading from the case, and clips together around you EVO very well. this is a great buy for anybody on a tight budget or even if you refuse to pay $30 or more for a stupid case for your phone this is totally worth buying!!!!",5
"Despite the Thanksgiving holiday, the item was shipped and received quickly. However, the bigger stones are more dull as though they have glue on them or were scraped against something, nothing drastic but noticeable if you're paying attention to details- that is the only reason I am giving this case four stars. The idea of the design is beautiful and I fell in love with the colors and 3D effects. On a positive note, I have received nothing but nice compliments for this item I paid such a low price for.",4
the rhinestones started falling off with wear and tear. It diffently won't last forever! I wish I would have ordered more than one,3
Seller is very helpful and friendly through return process. This item is NOT created with rhinestones or any stone at all. It's flat lackluster stick ons and the glitter is not sealed on so it gets glitter everywhere. Spend the extra money if you want to really bling out your phone and get a real rhinestone studded cover or decal.,1
"I absolutely love this case. I love pink & bling. Best of both in this product. I have yet to lose any crystals. Overall, I love it!",5
The color is very pretty and has lots of bling.  This really fits my phone nice and I have got a lot of compliments on this.,5
very cute but it does make an already bulky phone bulkier but it is super cute and study .did he job in protecting my phone,3
"I spent little to no money for this product and I would give it five stars for price alone but there is a slight flaw in the case design. The top/front of the face plate comes down too far, therefore the notification bar is really hard to drag down because the face plate partially blocks the top of the phone.",3
"I get so many compliments on it. I have it for over 4 months and the only place where the rhinstones fell is on the corners, where it falls when I have dropped it.  For the price, it's a good buy, and there are so many different designs in the market, that I don't mind changing this one to another one when more rhistones fall off.  As a matter of fact, I just ordered a new design today.  It has also protected my EVO nicely!",4
"This case is super cute, and it fit my phone perfectly without affecting it's performance. I have it for about 2 weeks now and Ive only had maybe 1 or 2 jewels pop off ... but it's cool because this case is 25 bucks in most stores and I got it for a fraction of that!",5
"I love my case! It is flashy and stylish. The only thing is that the rhinestones are beginning to come off. Yes, already. I purchased it a month ago. However, you are not able to see where the missing ones are. So, it is ok.",4
"Liked the item when I first got it, but the rhinestones do began to fall off after about a month or two.",4
Fast shipping. Love the color!!!!! Design is great. I must say THE JEWELS started to come off VERY QUICKLY. Probably wouldnt puchase this type from this seller agan.. Its VERY difficult to pull it off also. BUT IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD!,2
I love this cover! Fits my evo 4g perfectly. Made strong ive had it for over 2 months and none of the bling has come off. I dont put it in my pocket or anything because im afraid that will make them come off but i like it!,5
I like this case it's very pretty and comes with a little crowbar to pop it out of place if you get bored of it. Shipper is on point with the delivery time and I was not disappointed with the quality.,5
"I received the cell phone cover yesterday. It's perfect! I rubbed the cover trying to get rhinestones to fall off and not one came off (I kept hearing from friends to be careful about buying rhinestone covers because they fall of easily.) The clear/black rhinestones are against a silver glitter phone case. It looks so cute! Very, very girly! Just what I was looking for. I can not say enough good things about this phone cover.",5
"I thought it was so cute at first, until I started noticing the little beads sticking to my arm and hands. They come off very easily especially where you touch or hold your phone the most. So, if you want a blinged out case just for a week or two,purchase this product cause that's how long it will last!!!",1
GTMax charger works just as described. A great bargain. Would definitely recommend this product over the costly name brands. Save yourself some money.,5
The perfect charger for new smart phones. It charges quickly even while using Pandora or gps I have bought 2,5
This one charges much faster than the standard one.  I can use my Android on my motorcycle with it bluetoothed and GPS enabled and the screen on full bright and it still charges faster than discharging.  The stock on doesn't.,5
this is a slow charge so don't expect a fast charge because it wont happen ... .... ... ... ... ..,3
"My wife was given this and, admittedly, she is tough on the hardiest of equipment but she made short work of this.  Not sure if they make an industrial strength car phone charger.",2
"This charger worked like a champ for the first few months I had it, then suddenly it stopped. It still lit up like it was charging, but nothing I plugged into it would charge. Worked really well until it died, though.",2
The charger works great!  Charges really fast and I have no complaints!  It does what it says!  Have no problems with my Galaxy S4.,5
"I noticed that my Samsung Galaxy 2 note wasn't charging in my car, charge would stay the same.  Then I realized it needs a 2 amp charger.  So I bought 2 of these for both of my cars and wasn't disappointed.  Now it charges in no time and the white back piece glows a cool blue to let you know you have power.Only problem is that I seldom need it because battery life is so good on the note 2.",5
Great phone case I used this case for about 2 years. It protected my phone well and didn't let it get damaged. I would drop it time and time again and never did it damage the phone.,4
"I thought I would have a hard time finding a good cover, but this cover is a great fit and has great texture on the back. Great fit for the DROID X !!!!",5
I wanted this as a cheap case for around the house and when moving my phone between my pocket and car dock.  It does just that.  It isn't secure enough for me for all my needs (hence why I also purchased an Otterbox Defender for when I'm at work or crazy situations).,4
"The order got to me in a very timely manner (3 days, standard ship). The only small complaint that I have is that the bottom left corner of the case sits strangely on the phone. Otherwise, it is exactly what I was expecting to receive.",4
"This is one of the first skins I bought for my Droid. It has a soft rubber feel that drags in your pocket and it is too bulky for me. I does a good job protecting your phone, and it looks nice. There are better ones out there.",3
"This is a great product, but like others that have reviewed, there is something going on with the bottom left USB/HDMI port area, where it lifts up a bit. Very strange. The texture on the back of it is cool! The volume, camera, and power buttons are all covered by the silicone, which is really great to me. It has a non-slip texture to it, so you can put it on your dashboard and not worry about it sliding around. Enjoy!",4
"Very durable case. I drop my phone a lot and this case got scratched up, sure. But, It still works fine. My onlt complaint is how difficult it is to take off.",4
"This case offers nearly no protection AT ALL. The case is just garbage, it's so tight, when you put it on, it cracked the back of my phone, and the dirt gets  under the horrid molding and scratchhes the phone to death. I'm glad, I have insurance on my iPhone. I suggest you DO NOT BUY.",1
This case is awesome if you have a sticker or a decal on the back of your phone that you don't want to get ruined. It snaps completely around the phone leaving all buttons and charging port uncovered.,5
This case was perfect for any outfit because it is clear ad matches everything!! The clips stayed in place until I had to pry it out. Be advised it is hard to get off but that just shows the great quality of the case! Enjoy this case!,5
My only reason I purchased this case was to change the backing. I found a pin on Pinterest showing some scrapbook paper in the back of a clear case. I love this one because it has that top snap part. I wasn't too fond of the ones that just snap in back. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes to change their case as much as I do. All you have to do is change the paper. Not the case!,5
"This is what it is. It's a clear plastic cover, I like it. I put a Skin under it, and then the plastic cover, it's nice. Thats what I have had on my phone for a while now.",4
nice fit but a little hard to reach some buttons because of case thickness. better protection than the belkin case i had before. like it so far.,4
"Shipping was slow , fits my iphone 4 from sprint perfectly but as i snapped the case on i noticed that one of the snaps to secure the phone in the case was broken it still is worth buying but my thing is dont send me a case thats already broken. I feel like if i pay for a product i deserve what i payed for dont just send me any old thing .",1
I really like how if you put your phone to turn on the LED flash to flash on a text message the whole case lights up!,5
"This clear case is nice because it has a front and a back, which I like in terms of protecting the screen; however, that being said, I think it makes the phone too thick. The hard plastic is not very thin, so another thing that bothers me is that where they have left cutouts, your finger has to go inside this deep hole to reach the buttons.  They did well though with the holes not impeding the charger, or creating problems with the camera.  I have not dropped my phone so I cannot speak to whether or not it scratches easily or protects the phone like the other reviewer.  I do note that it does NOT fit the phone quite right.  The phone moves around a bit in the case.  I agree with the other reviewer - it is hard to take the case off. It does not seem to gather dust though, in between the phone and the case.",3
This case was above my standards for what I paid for it it snaps on tight and fits like a glove.It's what you would expect all the ports and buttons are still easily accessedI would recommend this to anyone just trying to get a basic cheap case for their iphone.,5
"This was a waste of money, I am glad I did not pay much for it since its a piece of garbage, it does not fit the iphone 4s as stated it wont even close.",1
"I wolud buy it again uf i needed to, the case is exactly as shown in the pictures and it fits the way it should.",5
"Got just what was described. The quality for the price is good, and it stays on the phone without any problems.",5
its not the same case i recieved. its a total compelty different one.doesnt look nothing like this the one i recieved.,1
It's a light wight case it fits the phone perfectly good price as well if you order that case order more than one because you probably going to need one every month,4
"I recently wrote a review about a gorgeous metal pink peacock case that I cannot use because of how the metal interferes with reception. So I purchased this one. Reason being, I like the way it protects the phone not just sides and back but in the front top and bottom also. I'm a true believer it makes sense to protect your phone so they always perform properly while they stay looking nice. This is a snap together case in clear and I have covered it with flat Swarvoski crystals which are beautiful. The clear case allowed ME to as creative as I wanted. Very nice and the price was right!",5
I am satisfied with this product. It works great and I had no problems putting it on. This is a good product.,5
You guys should really write instructions on how to get the case off after you put it on. Its impossible...,2
I purchased this case from BuyBest USA and I love it. I bought this because I wanted to print pictures from google and put the pictures on the back of the phone. It turned out great but it is a little struggle to get the case off the phone.,5
Very nice can make multiple designs and inserts for this case which makes it a total steal and it securely locks onto the phone.,5
"I needed a protective case for our phone.  I'm impressed how snug this fits around the phone without slipping off the case.  Soft, resists dirt and grime, tactile, and visually pleasing.",5
"Fit is great, makes the phone feel not as slippery, makes the phone easier to hold.  No cons about this case that I can notice.",5
"Nice looking, only drawback is it's hard to push side buttons unlike the tmobile ugly covers.",5
The case looks awesome.. but right when you put it on and want to hit the power button the rubbers a bit stiff so its kind of hard to turn on the device. same with the volume button!!,3
"Fits very well. Cutouts in the important places (camera, speaker, usb/headphone ports) - you can still open/close the sliding cover on the usb port with it on.Looks nice. My girlfriend likes it. She drops phones a lot, so needs some extra protection.The material is pretty hard. It isn't as soft and rubbery as some I've used in the past, so I don't think it will protect from drops as well. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the buttons are hard to press. Extremely hard to press, enough so that it might be a deal breaker. We'll see in a week or so.I may try to cut some slits to make it easier to press the buttons. if I do, I'll post some pics.Can't really recommend this, considering how hard it is to use the phone with it on. Maybe it will be beter once I take a razor to it.",3
"Beautiful case, fit like a glove. Just the right coloring which does not take away from the beauty of the phone, it only enhances it.",5
"This case fits very snug so you don't have to worry about it sliding off unintentionally. As one person has mentioned before, the color is more of a clear sky blue instead of the teal that is shown in the picture. The only real problem with the case is how difficult it is to hit the power button when it is on. I used a sharp knife to cut a whole out in this location and a lighter to melt the edges.Overall this product is not bad, but not great. Considering the price, if you need a case for your Galaxy S, you could do worse.",3
Color was true to color in picture which was great. All buttons on side of phone were still accessible and did not stick.,5
"This case is just like the smokey colored one but a nice glazed blue color. It doesn't look like the pictures.  It is, however, just as sturdy.  I bought it for myself.  First my husband wanted it, then my son.  I'll have to order another one!",5
I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves the case.  The power button is a little hard to push but it's not that difficult.,5
This case works great. It fits and protects..and also looks cool. The case is not Teal as the pictures make it look. The only Con I have is that the power button is hard to push but I've gotten used to it.,5
Perfect fit for Samsung Galaxy 4G for T-Mobile. Great protection. The case has a good feel to it without being too tacky.,5
"I was looking for a case that protected my Galaxy when I was using it and would fit in a belt case or holster when I wasn't.  I was having a hard time finding one that did both but finally settled on a Body Glove case.  It looked good and had a belt clip.Unfortunately, when the phone was clipped to my belt, the screen was not protected; it faced out and hit anything I bumped into.  A friend gave me a Droid X case, and since the Droid X is larger than the Galaxy, my Galaxy fit with the body glove case on it.  I used it like this even though it was very hard to get in and out of the case because of the friction from the BG case.  When the outer rubber layer of the BG started peeling off, I tossed it and bought this case.It's perfect.  It's thin, lightweight, and fits snugly with all the holes where they're supposed to be.  It doesn't look like the picture, it looks better.  It's translucent and the argyle pattern is subtle, only showing when light reflects off it.  A very good looking TPU case.  It's not slippery at all and yet it slides in and out of the belt case easily.  I've already dropped it once (on the bathroom tile floor) and there was no damage.A few reviews I read said the buttons were hard to press with the case on.  I haven't had that problem.  It keeps me from accidentally pressing the side buttons and works fine when I want to press them.After researching all the cases out there and trying several of them out, the one that makes the most sense for me is this simple, cheap TPU case.  Highly recommended.",5
"Its TPU so its hard and durable and doesn't stick like regular silicone cases or collect dust. Fits PERFECT on the phone. Definitely worth the money considering however much money you may have payed for the phone. Yes, the power/lock button is annoying at first. Either get used to it, which you will, or Ive seen people cut that part out with a blade. But think of it this way, if it wasnt covered i wold be more prone to water damage idk. It was either this case, or get one of those body glove snap on case which usually bulks up the phone.",5
"I protected it, and is a very hard case. However, it is difficult to take it off because it is very snug onto the phone.",3
"Lots of reviews already, so let me get to the point:1. Aesthetically pleasing - argyle design gives it an upper-class, preppy feel. Whether that is good or bad is up to your own interpretation.2. Functional - provides decent protection for the phone, especially on the backside. On the front side, it does protect a little because it overlaps the bezel portion, hence if the phone falls on a flat surface on the front side, it does provide some protection. However, and this is a fault from the type of touchscreen phone that this is, and not of the case itself, if the phone were to make contact from a fall on an angled surface, then obviously the case would provide no protection.3. The nature of this type of rubber synthetic material gives it a non-slip function - great for when in your hand, and also for like when placing it inside various areas of your car (dashboard, cup-holder, etc.).4. When they say it provides a perfect match for the holes and coverings, it is true - no issues whatsoever there.5. Excellent price value.The only gripe I have is the covering parts over the power/lock/unlock key and the volume keys make it harder to push those buttons. Now you have to really push them for them to register.All in all this is a good case, definitely recommended.FYI- I prefer Otterbox cases for their extreme protection (I have ones for my Nokia 5800 and N900), but Otterbox is also known for their clunkiness. As of this writing, I see that Otterbox just came out with one, albeit withouts photos yetOtterbox Samsung Vibrant Commuter Series Case, but I bet this Amzer one is a lot more svelte. The Otterbox (right now) is also a lot more expensive.",5
"This fits the Samsung galaxy S like a glove and isn't too bulky at all.  I dropped my phone about 5 ft onto tile and it was completely unscathed due to this thick rubber case.  It does not look black, but rather a smokey grey and at first glance no one can tell there is even a case on the phone.  Yes, the right upper side button is a bit hard to push, but you get used to it.  This case is much less bulky than the two piece versions that click together and are mostly gaudy.  If you're looking for a low key, great protection cover, this is it.  And I have ordered more than my fair share since our whole family has the same phone.",5
"This is a soft shell cover. I use it on my Samsung Galaxy S T959. It fits perfectly over the back of the phone and it doesn't interfere with the camera or the chrarger. I've dropped my phone a few times, and thanks to this cover, no damage. This grey cover just happened to be the only one the store had left in the mall. I like the soft covers more than the hard shell covers.",4
"I bought this case for my wife's phone, a Samsung Galaxy by T-mobile.  The case fits perfectly, it has been 4 months of use and it is still very solid and it hasn't gotten loose (still fits the phone as if it were brand new).  Most importantly, my wife has dropped the phone couple of times and the case has indeed protected the phone and screen, absorbing the impact.  If you get a Samsung Galaxy without a case, the first drop will break your screen, so this has been a very good purchase (saves you over $300 or more for getting a replacement phone).",5
I had purchased a set of these for my Droid X and they seems to work great. They are a bit tricky to get on so make sure you wipe the screen clean of any lint or dust because it will get stuck under the screen protector and if you are anything like me you will be annoyed by it. I managed to get the protector on with one minor piece of lint on the edge of the screen and some small air pockets at the edge of the screen that didn't seem to go away no matter how hard I tried. Eventually they just dissipated. Sadly today I dropped my phone on the hard concrete floor and lucky I had this screen protector because there was no scratches to the screen but the outer case didn't fair so well. I would buy another pair again if I need to.,4
"I've probably never had such mixed feelings about a product, as I do for the Steinheil Anti-Fingerprint Screen Protector. On the plus side, it has drastically reduced the amount of screen wiping I had been doing due to fingerprints, and gives my phone's screen a little extra protection from scratches. I also like the feel of the matte finish protector better than the glossy glass feel, when using the touch screen. This is purely a matter of taste though, as many will like the feel of the glass instead. On the negative side, the matte finish degrades the Droid X's glossy screen's resolution noticeably. Bubble free installation is also very difficult, but not impossible with a lot of patience. I do not find any benefit from its 'anti-glare' claims. While the matte finish may reduce glare somewhat when using indoors under certain lighting conditions, any benefits are quickly negated when using outdoors. I find that it not only doesn't help when using the phone in sunlight, it makes the screen more difficult to see even with the brightness turned all the way up. As of now, I'm keeping the Steinheil Anti-Fingerprint Screen Protector on my phone. I may take it off in the near future though, if I can't get used to the loss of my screen's resolution.",3
"I loved this screen protector for about a month, until I realized the protector was scratched easily. The application was easy and it fit almost perfect to the edges of the screen (minus the corners and edges that don't stay down all the way). I believe they give you more than one, not only in case you mess up application - but because if you hate the look of tiny scratches all over, you will be replacing in a month. I really don't like the thick protectors, like Zagg and such - but if only they could make a protector that was super thin AND didn't scratch. I guess I can only dream!",3
This is no different than the ones I buy from eBay ... I buy a 3 pack of these for $2.05 for my coworkers for their droid x phones . I bought this one for me and I fell for all the bs marketing on this product. You mostly pay $10 to cover their packaging and for the cheesy certificate of authenticity .... Really do I need a serial number and a certificate of authenticity for a dumb screen cover !?!? Maybe I will frame it and put it on my desk lol .,1
"This screen protector is fabulous!  It goes on easy, has great glare resistance, and feels great under my fingers.  The pebbled screen also provides very little interference with reading, unlike some other nonglare screens I've tried.  When I need another protector, I'll be sure to look for one from this brand!",5
This screen protector is very good.  It is so clear that I actually forgot that it was installed.  It did not affect the touch screen at all.,4
"Bought first, over a year ago. Worked very well, clarity was excellent, resistant to scratches, cleaned easily.  Finally dropped In a gravel parking lot and the point of a rock gouged the film and allowed a tiny scratch on the Gorilla Glass (DroidX).  Even though it allowed that scratch, in my judgement it actually did pretty good job preventing worse damage.  I bought the same protector to replace it, and the scratch on the glass is now 'invisible' under the screen protector.  I think 6 more is a pretty goo time frame for routine replacement, and with the 2 protectors that come in the package, you easily net a year plus of protection.",4
"this screen protector is amazing... first it was very easy to install (took about 5 minutes), second it is really really clear. after applying the screen protector it seems like there isnt one on it.I have used many other screen protectors like the one from zagg and the Verizon store. this one clearly beats them in both quality and clarity.",5
"I received the screen protectors in a timely manner and they were what I wanted. They are very tricky to apply to the phone though. Maybe I am just impatient, but every screen protector that I have tried is difficult to apply without having air bubbles.",4
"what can i say its awesome. I actually took the screen protector off mine to protect my new HTC one before i had a chance to get one specifically for that phone, but after swapping from htc one back to droid x2 the screen protector is still like new! with no issues with bubbles. make sure to have a decent dust remover, that is the secret though. shows you the quality of SPG screen protectors being able to fully remove multiple times. I also did this about 8 or so months after first installation. so you know its not a brand new screen protector that i installed multiple times. I am currently using SGP on my HTC one and droid x2!",5
I ordered this after reading the rave reviews. I was looking for thin protection on my Droid X screen and this one was perfect. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is the fact it does get very scratched and it doesn't fit my screen to the edges. I end up having pieces of dirt and dust on the sides of the protector that I have to wipe away. It is extremely clear and would be a great screen protector if the cons were fixed.,3
"This is not an Apple bumper, but it's also a lot cheaper than an Apple bumper. I had a little bit of trouble hitting the button on top of the phone because of the cut out but I managed. It protects the phone as expected and for the price I really couldn't ask for more.",3
"These bumper cases are very nice, out the box they won't fit the iphone 4s, but a little work with an xacto knife, and we have a great fit.",4
"I put this bumper on my phone. It fits snug. I like the way it makes my phone looks. However the edges feel like im holding a butter knife, the power/sleep button and the volume buttons are very very hard to manipulate, i have a hard time turning my screen off on my phone. Also the usb charger port opening is too small, so your old cords wont fit unless you take the bumper off, and even with the new cord it makes it easy to come out.but over all the bumper fits it looks ok. and for just a buck and some change its good to have, but it's better ones out there.",2
"It's just a little bumper thing kind of like the Apple ones but a bit simpler in construction. Fits well, very happy with it. This is clearly made for an AT&T iPhone 4 in that the hole for the alert sounds on/off switch isn't quite big enough, but it still fits well enough for my Verizon iPhone 4 that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to others.",5
"I bought this case thinking it wouldn't last a week and I have to admit I'm on week 4 of using this. It is obviously that it doesn't compare to apples bumper, the buttons are stiffer and with the slight difference of spacing with the iPhone 4s the volume buttons are slightly off however they do work. My only real complaint is that the button covers (the silver tab) is not securely attached to the button pad, my power button cover went missing at some point this week however the actual pad that connects to Te phone is still there and works perfectly. The should use a stronger adhesive to get the tab to stick to the pad. The actual rubber is slightly stiffer than apples which might actually survive longer than apples if you swap cases constantly overall my only real concern is the power button loss which affects the durability.",2
I thought getting this bumper it was gonna be like a case but this doesn't protect the back of the phone at all.. Also the little buttons on the sides on the bumper that control the volume keep falling out. And it literally seemed like it took forever to get here but the price was right regardless.,2
Cheap! just wraps around the outside of the iphone... does not protect it in any way!! I'd say pass if your considering buying it!,1
"I would give this zero stars if I had an option because it does not work at all, at least for the iPhone 4S.  The ringer switch is slightly off center making it hard to access, presumably because it was made for the iPhone 4, the port opening for both the earphone and the [car] power cord are too small for either to fit so neither works, and the case pulls up the front and rear clear screen protectors and crunches them up.  This case does not work at all ... I need to keep searching for a case that actually works.",1
"I was expecting it to have a plastic cover on the back of the case, kind of like the Apple one. but it is literally just to protect your end. it will not help prevent scratches on the front or back. I would not recommended but for the price, sure.",3
"I liked it but It didn't last very long, it is very low quality. However, it looks very nice and feels good",3
"I am fully satisfied with my purchase. it does exactly what intended to do, protect the phone and also let's you see craftmanship of the device.",5
I have the white iPhone 4 hopefully the clear bumper comes in today should loook really good on my white iPhone 4,5
I HAVE NOT GOT THIS CASE YET BUT I LOVE IT IN THE PICTURE AND CAN'T WAIT UNTIL I GET IT BECAUSE I KNOW I WILL LOVE IT MORE ON MY PHONE.,5
Doesn't last as long as you want it to. Falls apart a few weeks after you start using it so you constantly have to order new ones.,3
"The Bumper worked great and fit great also. did what it had to do, lasted until i had to get my new iphone 5 so no complaints great bumper for the Price!!",5
I was using it and it broke ):I would like a new one though.They do get dirty and the silicone does come off...,3
Good case but the volume buttions are not assembled very well and the lock button bc it had fallen out.,4
"I call this the anti-case case. People often don't even realize that I have a case on my phone. I like that. I hate bulky cases. I use this bumper with transparent protector sheets on the front and back, so my entire phone is covered but it doesn't look or feel like it.There are silver buttons on the side where the volume controls are and on top where the sleep button is, which I like. Everything lines up nicely.I have dropped my phone a few times with this case on, and it seems to do pretty well in protecting it. It now has a few chips and dings on the case, which is fine.The only problem I have with this bumper is connecting to other devices. You cannot I have an iHome speaker system--the bumper is too thick for the phone to sit properly in the dock. Also, many headphones will not connect properly because of this bumper. The iPhone headphones are small enough to fit in the whole provided. However, when I'm driving, I have a cassette adapter to listen to my iPhone in my car, and I have to take the bumper partially off in order to fit the adapter into the headphone port.  It is pretty annoying to have to do that, as the bumper does not come off very easily. It's not very felixible--it's liek aI have other cases, but I've used this one everyday since it came in the mail. I love the way it looks (or doesn't look, for that matter) despite the inconvenience of not being able to hook it up to my audio equipment.",3
"I love the bumpers and the color.  It is easy to get on and off the phone for accessories, etc.  I would recommend to others.",5
I got this due to the cheapness of the item and it looks interesting on the iPhone. I have a 4S on AT&T; and the bumper fits snug but the hole over the Ring/Silence button slightly covers the button so you have to take a knife or something and dig out the thinner plastic so that the Ring/Silence button has the freedom to move.I do not recommend this if you have an iPhone4S.,2
"Well, its ok for the money and it looks nice, but its pretty flimsy and don't hold up very well.",3
"This is beyond cheap.  This bumper didn&#8217;t even work for 24 hours before the buttons started falling off.  Another cheap China product, but you get what you pay for.",1
Loved the colors and all but for protection not so great also if you don't have the right audio cord you will have to always take it off.,1
"The cutout for the bottom connector is too small and the hard plastic makes the volume and power button VERY hard to press. This is how to fix it.I liked the look of this bumper and at the low price it was worth a gamble.The unit has serious issues which leads me to believe that this unit was designed in a CAD program and was never actually prototyped and tested before they went into production.First the cutout on the bottom is too small for the Apple sync/charge connector. You have to pull the bumper off to fit it or use my &#34;fix&#34; described below.The second problem is that the volume buttons are very hard to press, same with the power on/off button on the top. So hard that in my opinion they are unusable as shipped.The solution is as follows. Use an X-Acto knife or a Dremel tool to enlarge the holes. You can also make the buttons easier to press by making cuts around the buttons (weakening the material) until you get a pressure you are comfortable with.Personally, I never found a comfortable pressure level so I ended up completely cutting out both buttons. This leaves the original iPhone controls exposed but inset. It works fine for me but if you have large fingers or long fingernails, you may have difficulty pressing the buttons.I did this because I already had the unit and have the tools. The plastic is fairly tough so you do need a sharp knife and a fair amount of steady pressure to cut.  If you aren't a handy person or don't have the tools, I would recommend avoiding this poorly designed product.",1
I ordered it about a month ago and have yet to receive it. Don't think i ever will... :(There's no way to track either. If you're willing to lose a couple of bucks and it's not a big deal then no worries.,1
ITS VERY PRETTY YES BUT VERY CHEAP I HAD 2 OF THESE AND BOTH POWER BUTTONS BROKE OFF OF THEM :-( I WAS SO UPSET I JUST LEFT IT ALONE...,2
This case is a bumper only and it saved my wifes phone when it slipped and landed on a corner.  The case exploded off in pieces but there was no real damage to the phone.  Worth every penny and does not add much to the size of the phone.,5
this bumper fit my iphone 4 like a glove. it doesnt make it bulky and i like that it has a &#34;lip&#34; where it's raised a tad so if u drop it & it lands flat on it's front or back the glass wont hit and shatter :),5
"My battery case was being repaired so this was just a band aid for a few days, it served its purpose.",2
"I know this is a product. but I have never received it last year after I ordered it. I forgot to file a clam. but in a word, this is a very cool and fashion iphone case.",4
"This broke after a couple of weeks if using, but for the time i had it, it was nice. You get what you spend! It was only a dollar so there's that..",3
White and Blue Premium Bumper Case for Apple iPhone 4 - AT&T fits perfectly and it saved my phone plenty of times.,5
"all these $.99 cases suck. My step kids get them in bulk, as they break too easily. Not sure why but they like to change out their cases, which I think is ridiculous.  I put on my otterbox and set it and forget it.....",1
The rubber bumper part is so thin its barely there.  I ordered two and they were bent in different areas.  They offer no protection and they went right to the trash.,1
"if you want to waste money for this or you want to get cheaper iPhone 4, You may buy it.",1
Case is clear around the plastic part and is frosty on the rubber like front and back part. It's great fits tight and will lift up your screenProtecter. If you don't use them it's fine if so don't buy this.,5
Got this item to provide some extra grip for an otherwise slippery iPhone 4.  It tuRned yellow after 3-4 months and it looks terrible. At least I didn't pay a lot for it.  A complete disposable purchase.,3
This bumper was ok. Just not what I wanted to protect my iPhone. I like more protection. Again my fault need to read description more.,2
I would give it a 5 but it broke on me in the first week. But it looks good and it did its job! It's low in price so I can't really complain.,4
"I just received this product in the mail. I love the way it looks and that it is light weight. I do not like, however, the fact that it doesn't not cover the back of the phone. I do not know why I thought it did lol. This case is not for someone that is a little on the rough side of life or someone that throws their phone in their purse. I feel my phone will have a lot of dings and scratches fast.",3
"very protective, there is no much to say abot this product, all buttons, are perfectly matched with the iphone 4s.",5
"great bumper for phone, fits perfectly and provides a little protection,  looks good on the phone, can still scratch the back",5
I really liked this one for my wife's phone. However we had to wait for over two weeks before we saw it arrive in the mail box!,4
I had the worst experience with this bumper case because the blue silicone started to change color into a nasty yellow brown color and then it started to peel off. also the little silver buttons it has fell off and never found them again really consider buying this.... :( disapointed,2
"i got this yesterday, and it feels really nice and has the lock button so you don't have to try to squeeze your finger in the whole to lock it, it it great and looks really nice.",5
"came before the date it was suppose to come, very nice quality silicon lay on the table design. very sleek and stylish",5
I ha this bumper on my phone for a little under two weeks and the top lock button fell off. Also the product does not fit the iPhone exactly. The lock button and lock button on the phone do not match up exactly therefore it randomly will lock the phone. It is very sensitive which makes it quite annoying,2
"This case/cover is nothing as it was described or pictured when I purchased it, but now that I have received it, I see that the seller has changed the description and the pictures.  What I was expecting was a flexi case that covered the edges and back of my phone, what I got was a thin piece of plastic that fits around the outside edge of my phone.  Not what I wanted at all! I am thankful that this was so cheap, because I guess you get what you pay for, but these things will be going into the trash. First of all I wanted a clear case to cover the back of my phone so I could insert a piece of decorative paper to dress it up as I wanted, 2nd of all I do not see how something that only wraps around the edges of my phone is going to protect it in any way.  The product did come by the date that it said, but that date kept changing.  Originally I expected it to come before Christmas, but then the date changed until after the first of the year.  It did end up arriving around 12/29, but I had originally planned in giving one as a gift, but now that I see the poor quality, I won't be giving it as a gift anyway.  Very disappointing!",1
"Its pretty cheap, the side buttons don't go with the 4S's buttons and the case just looks dirty. Other than that go buy a real bumper case.",3
Cheap and amazing product. I bought it for my wife's iPhone and she loved it. Recommend as a cheap and good quality product.,5
The case is very sturdy and great quality. The only problem was that it took a month for it to come.,4
These do not protect your iphone at all they are difficult to snap together. they offer poor protection to your phone and nothing else but color,2
"This is a great bumper despite being so cheap. Great colors and product. Can't really think of anything else to put in these 20 descriptive words except, buy it!",5
I am ok with using this product but I wish the spots reaching the volume (+ and -) and off/on button would be larger or would not cover the bottons partially. Overall it is a good product considering the price :),3
This is the perfect case for anyone who doesn't like big bulky cases but still wants their phone protected. It's so cute and easy to put on.,5
goes on easy by slipping around the phone. slightly soft and fits very well. Put on the anti scratch screen first. Case comes with opepings for camera and speakers. Volume controls are under the skin but have buttons exactly matching.,3
"The price was great! It was shipped promptly. I used it a couple of time and realized that I wanted full coverage protection for my iPhone. Other than that, it functions how it should.",5
"I received the item within the week and wasn't expecting it until weeks later. The item was what I was expecting, great deal",5
I really dint like this product as per the quality and ol. I would say just use it as long as u can....,2
it fits perfect and it looks great on my phone.,5
"I love this bumper. I wanted to keep my Apple iPhone's simple aesthetic as close to its original appearance as possible, but while safeguarding it from accidental drops.  This is the product.  Mine is not off-colour as other folks have experienced.  The button-holes are near exact, except for the mute switch which was slightly off, but corrected with a couple flicks of the x-acto knife.  I loved my initial (and cheap!) purchase so much that I came back to Amazon to purchase four more; I ended up giving three away.  I then purchased a Tiffany Smart Zip Wallet.  My other pink rubber bumper did not work with that case, sticking & making it hard to insert/pull out--but no such problems for this bumper.  I've also dropped my phone a couple times and the bumper did its job.  I love these so much that I might purchase a couple more.",5
"U get what u pay for. Good but not perfect. Will not last forever. Getting dirty like look, as plastic loosing a bit of color.",3
i am obsessed with phone cases and i love this one. it is very durable. fits the iphone4 PERFECT i couldnt ask for a better case!,5
"The good news is that the case is cheap. It protects the phone from falls and judging from the scratches around the corners (of the case, not on the phone), its doing a good job. The rubber protrudes over the front and back so that when the phone is lying on a flat surface it doesn't actually touch it. It's small, so it doesn't bulk up the phone like other cases can.The bad news is that it won't last too long. After a few months the rubber will look grayish, a few months after that, it may start peeling. I only costs $2 to replace, though! I bought a few in different colors and can switch them up.Shipping takes a while and they don;t provide tracking, but I have gotten all of my packages (it takes about a month or so).I drop my phone on a daily basis. With this cover and front/back screen protectors, it has been more than enough to keep my phone crack and scratch-free for over a year.",4
"I really like this bumper! it's a lot cheaper than the ones they sell in the store, and they work probably just as good. I really like the color too!",4
Nice and sturdy. I have 3 I phones. So We are able to distingues the different phones.  I would recommend them to my family and friends.,5
"This is a great product. It shows off the phone itself, but keeps it protected as long as you have screen protectors.Awesome purchase.",5
I have dozens of cases and this is one of the best I've received.  Great case for an unbelievable price!,5
"The clear bumper fits the 4s ok. Not perfect, the volume buttons are off just by 0.5mm, which I can live with. You will need to trim the lower edge of the opening for the mute switch/ left upper side as it rubs against the switch...I used an exacto blade and took of about 0.5-1mm to clear it.It DOES Stain easy! My case is no longer clear, stained permanently with black from the inside of a bk leather pouch. I would recommend you go with a colored/ smoke version of the same product.",3
"Color is true to pics, has lasted so far making it durable, phone looks awesome in it and it gives it full coverage if dropped!",5
"Solid investment. I got this bumper to essentially hold me until Apple sends my free, expensive case weeks later. I really felt I needed something because the glass back on iPhone 4 seems really fragile. I ordered the CLEAR bumper, which I was excited about because I really wanted to preserve the iPhone 4 look as much as possible, but when I received my order I got a WHITE bumper. I really don't care for white cases because they get really dirty, but since I only spent 4-5 bucks altogether on this, it was hardly worth the trouble of returning it. It definitely seems like a solid enough case for what I paid and it shipped and arrived quickly (but I still wish it was clear as advertised). It does not, however, 'cover' the back of the phone. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer is referring to.*EDIT* Having seen a phone with the Apple bumper, I now understand the previous reviewer's comment. This bumper keeps the back from hitting when you set it down on the table. Apple ones are flush to the back so the back hits when you set it down.",3
Great cover for a great price! This fits the iphone 4s perfectly! Got this as a Christmas gift for my dad and he will love it!,5
This clear is not a good quality plastic it turns yellow and I do not smoke so that is horrible.,1
"After a couple of weeks of use, the rubber portion starts to separate from the plastic. Although it's cheap enough i don't mind because i bought extra.",2
"This is a great bumper and very cheap. It is not bad quality at all, which is expected from cases that are this inexpensive. The only issue I have with it is the case makes it a little difficult to turn the phone on silent. I know that the Sprint iPhone (which I have) and the AT&T iPhone have their buttons a little different. So I cannot complain too much. But if there was just a little bit more space for the button that would have been great.",4
"it arrived on time, but it wasn't shipped to the right address, I had to walk 15 mins to pick it up. Something even more disappointing is, the volume button '-' doesn't work at all after i put this case on. fortunately it was only one dollar'",1
"I love these covers.... But saying that - they don't last too long because the buttons all fall out of the cover if you ever have to take the case on and off... And yes - you have to take it off in order to plug your phone into a lot of different things. A standard plus will work without taking the case off but if you have a stand, or a radio alarm clack it fits into, or just a speaker system that it plugs into then you have to remove the case because it gets in the way of the plug and wont make a secure connection.The case is great as a protection though for the phone and since you can get them here online for pretty cheap I still use these bumper cases even if I have to replace it weekly or bi-weekly... $4-6 a month is still better than the $30 it costs for the name brand that only last a couple months anyway...",3
"again this item was shipped on time, but was extremely poor quality. the bumper did not fit correctly on my phone so I was unable to use the buttons on the top and side. was VERY dissappointing",1
Very Light Weight.works good is you have a non physical job. However if you &#34;work&#34; for a living stay away and buy the &#34;Otterbox&#34;.,3
"This item was perfect, exactly like how you see it. It's a bumper case for your phone, it's soft and won't damage your phone",5
"Really shows signs of wear after 6 months, but for the price I could buy them bi-annually and be fine.",3
I dropped it on the ground once and it shaddered. I wish they would have made it more stronger. I didn't like it at all.,1
I ordered this product based on price and I guess you get what you pay for it. It is very cheap product.,2
"It added a bit of bulkiness to the device, but served its purpose.  But I eventually had to find something more slim to be less bulky around the sides.",3
"I am a huge case fanatic. I  have probably about 15 cases, but I keep going back to this one. It's fits perfect, better than the cases I have spent $15 on at best buy. It's thick enough to keep your camera bezel off the table or ground but thin enough to not take away from the shmexiness of the phone itself. Construction quality is great, no seams, no 'stickiness' like silicone cases. I have two other non-apple bumpers, and I find that they push up my screen protectors causing bubbles, but this one is the only one that does not. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a high-quality bumper but don't want to spend $30 on an apple one.",5
The bumper looks just as it should and is made of relatively durable material. The product is not made in the U.S.A. so shipping takes a while but it is definitely worth the price.,4
"It is great, protects the phone very well, is like rubber so when it falls it protects it from any where, you can see the phone all around. The only thing is with time it starts getting yelowish. It is the best protector that I had, my phone suffers falls very often.",5
"Everyone is complaining about the color not being white, mine was white and i believe many of received a clear case instead and i believe you. As for the fit, i like the tight fit but it is very hard to remove. I removed mine one to install the scratch protection film and had no problems. It doesn't really provide much protection if you drop it, it can break easily. My wife has one that started cracking at the bottom corners and she is very protective of her iphone so i believe some of the products are not made very well.",5
I loved this product for a while but after a little bit it lost its color and started to fall apart. Amazing for the price it was!,3
"This is a GREAT ITEM!!  HOWEVER, it was VERY difficult to get the film on the phone without anything between the phone screen and the case.  HOWEVER, this is mostly user error.  Once on this item is GREAT!!!A++++",5
"I tried many anti-glare screen protectors in the past, only to peel them off and throw them away on the first day of use because of poor performance and visual distortion of the screen. This particular screen protector is a high quality item and works beautifully.If you use your iPhone as your main camera, then you understand the need for a good anti-glare screen protector for those day time beach shots. I've used my iPhone on several bright and 'glarey' situations and I can see my screen with no problems! AND it does not distort my screen's graphics like most others. I'm thrilled!Installation requires patience, as every single other screen protector does. That's why they include 2. Your first attempt will most likely end badly...as every other screen protector installation does. Although, I gotta say, compared to others, air bubbles were not an issue with this screen protector. My problem is aligning it properly. Also, take this tip; make sure you rub the preinstallation sticker-thing ALL OVER the screen leaving no corner unrubbed. I failed to rub a tiny bit of one of the corner of my screen and the screen protector will not adhere now. Dunno what's in the preinstallation sticker-thing, but aparently it's crucial to a good installation.",5
"I used to be a long time customer of Ghost Armor, but recently I have had to get my screen replaced by them too often and then the local booth in my mall closed down. I decided that I wanted something more out of my protective screen and looked into anti-glare and anti-fingerprint screens. This came highly recommended and now I know why. Easy to install with the pre-install film removing almost all dust, and they are extremely difficult to remove as well. The anti fingerprint works great, leaving me extremely happy and the anti-glare is not a hassle like I thought it might by dimming the screen too much or destroying the clarity. Great quality and easy to install by yourself.",5
These are the brand sold on Apple's website. Love them. Easy to apply and very protective. Doesn't scratch easily and comfortable to feel.,5
"This is my first experience with an anti-glare screen film. It does reduce/eliminate glare as advertised; however, it makes the retina display on my iPhone 4s a little fuzzy - it doesn't allow the beauty of the screen to come through the film. This disappointed me, so I've ordered a different brand screen protector that is not anti-glare.",4
Installed this screen protector on my newly Iphone 4s for the past 4 weeks. It performs wonderfully as advert. I specially like the touch of it. With rhis screen protector I feel my phone is guarded perfectly well! It fits with Speck Candyshell or Otterbox Commuter.,4
"This is a dull, thick beast of a non-stick ill-conceived piece of scrap plastic.  You won't like it and you'll never be able to get the bubbles out of it, even if you can get it on the phone without little pieces of dust getting under it and holding the plastic off the screen.  Look elsewhere!",1
"This is hands down the best screen protector for the iPhone.  I've tried many as a manager of over 150 company cell phones and I like this one the best.  Their horribly expensive but work wonderfully.  There are pros and cons to all screen protectors.  I feel this one has the fewest cons and is the best product.  You will get greasy smears with all of them, even no protector at all.  Just wipe it off.  Some of the other brands are even hard to wipe off the screen but not this one.  I would suggest a nice micro fiber cloth and canned air for installing any screen protector.",5
"Pros&#8226; High optical clarity. Does not degrade Retina screen visual quality.&#8226; Does not noticeably interfere with touchscreen performance/sensitivity&#8226; Does not significantly alter tactile feel of touchscreen although you can tell there is a screen film in place vs. a uncovered iPhone.&#8226; Easy to wipe down.Undercut film size for easier applicationCons&#8226; Film hardness is slightly soft. Scratches on the film will start to appear after a period of use so eventual replacement may be needed.&#8226; Film is undercut just a couple mm too much so there is small gap in coverage even if the film is perfectly centered around the home button/receiver/camera.&#8226; Smudges just as with an uncovered screen&#8226; As with all films, correct application is highly user dependent. Patience, a steady hand and ensuring as dust free an environment as possible is vital.",4
"The Powersupport protectors are the best hands down.  You will find this is the case especially since they are the only ones that Apple will carry on their site.  They leave no sticky residue on your phone should you decide to take them off your phone.  Gives you the peace of mind that your screen is safe from damage.  Read what you want, but the iPhone screens DO scratch.",5
"I have tried over 10 kinds of screen shields ranging from cheap ones to very expensive ones. Power support is by far the best and easiest to install. You cannot tell it is on if you get it straight unless you look for the edges purposely. It leaves no rainbow effects and if you make sure there is no dust under it, it will go on with no bubbles very easily. I ordered another set because mine was getting a little worn after 6 months from the seller abe-123. What I recieved was a cheap, most likely chinese, screen shield similar to the ones included with iphone cases. It went on poorly, and left rainbow effects (see product picture in the submitted pictures on the main page) Power Support screen shields are the best, just don't buy them from abe-123 unless you want to be ripped off!!! I am trying to get them booted off of Amazon for this because people who have never used Power Support products may not know they are being ripped off. If anyone wants to help out I could use the help.",1
"This purchase was well worth it. Easy to apply them, and they last forever. If I remember correctly there are 2 in the pack. I've had my iphone for 4 years, I just applied the second film now. Great product!",5
The application is much better than any iphone screen application I've used in the past (I've used about 3 different brands for different iphones)!!!  The screen protector seems good so far.  It quickly smudges worse than with nothing on iphone at all.  But at least the screen is protected.,4
"Simply put, this is the best and easiest to install screen protector out there. This one for the iphone 4 is great and lets the retina display shine through. I previously had this protector on my iphone 3G and it lasted for 2 years, no scratches or anything. It may be a little expensive, but it is worth the money. Other protectors frustrated me to put on and the invisible shield was an odd texture, this one is just right for me.",5
"I've used this screen protector on my iPhone 4, my parents iPhone 4s and my boyfriend's iPhone 4. The application is easy and it barely feels or looks like there is a screen protector applied. Also, these last forever even when the phone is in a pocket, purse, falling face first on a sharp rock.I just wished that Amazon carried them for iPhone 5 and I made a mistake of purchasing the Spigen screen protector which SUCKS!",5
"I bought this for my new iPhone 2 weeks ago after being with Blackberry for so many years using a BSE.The PowerSupport screen protector is just incredible compared to the gummy type protectors.I am amazed by the technology of it and how the material is just truly perfect for this device.Best protective add-on for my iPhone 4s so far and does not detract from screen or touch input.Take your time and watch the video for a good installation.Buy this product if you use an iPhone 4s.Also, I've had it on for 2 weeks and have never had to clean it. The guy that said it attracts oils and dirt is mistaken. Thats why I'm creating this review because its so good. Really ... :)",5
"Power Support screen films:Don't attract fingerprints like other screen protectors do.They don't have a rainbow hue at different angles like other screen protectors do.They don't peel off after a month like other screen protectors do.They don't get covered in scratches after a month like other screen protectors do.You catch what I'm getting at?Very durable, almost invisible, oil-resistant.I buy these and only these for every phone I've owned since the iPhone 3G.",5
"Ordered from EZ Electronics. Scam is not true powersupportusa like at the apple store. All powersupport screens for iPhone 4/4S have cutout for proximity sensor. This did not, but did show same name and logo without USA. So if you have a white early model like me you have to have this cutout. I did call powersupport and they said that all have cut out in green packaging and that the others are rejects and/or earlier versions before they fixed for sensor.",1
"I have used Crystal Film by PowerSupport on iPods and various other gadgets with screens for about 6 years.  I have also tried screen film from the popular brand Zagg (a favorite at Best Buy) and a couple others.By far, PowerSupport's Crystal Film is the best.  Installing it is not trivially easy, but is definitely possible.  Other reviewers here have lots of good tips for installing, and you should definitely check out the short video at PowerSupport's website.Once on, the film is virtually invisible.  It causes absolutely no degradation in clarity or definition.  I consider this extremely important for a device like the iPhone 4, which has such a gorgeous, high-definition display.Also, the Crystal Film 'feels' just like the glass it's protecting.  It doesn't feel gummy and doesn't affect the touchscreen's sensitivity.Once on, the Crystal Film stays on pretty much forever (if you want it to - but you can remove it easily if you want).  It is very easy to keep clean.  Just wipe with a microfiber cloth or any lens cleaning cloths you might use for eyeglasses.I have tried the Zagg film.  I found it felt gummy and, more importantly, reduced the image quality of the display.  Highly detailed photos or videos just don't look tack-sharp through Zagg film.Sure, you can get cheaper screen protector films.  But you paid a LOT for your iPhone, and it has a really beautiful high-def 'retina' display.  It is so worth spending a few extra dollars to get Crystal Film.  You will be very glad you did.PowerSupport sells several different sets.  Some come with a film for the back of the iPhone - I recommend that.  Keeping the back of your phone protected will increase its resale value when you're ready to trade up for an iPhone 5 or iPhone 5S someday.Also, they have some sets with two Crystal Films for the front, and sets that have both a Crystal Film and an Anti-glare film for the front of the iPhone.  I do not recommend the anti-glare film (either PowerSupport's or anyone else's anti-glare film).  It reduces glare but also doesn't have quite the same clarity and sharpness that the Crystal Film has.  And glare with the Crystal Film really isn't that bad.If this is the first time you're purchasing Crystal Film, it's worth getting a set with two front films, in case you screw one up when installing it.  (You probably won't, but just in case.)  But if you have a bit of experience installing Crystal Films on other devices, you should be fine with a set that contains just one front and one back, rather than two fronts and one back.But whatever set you get, just get Crystal Film instead of an inferior product.  Your iPhone deserves it, and you will be glad you did!",5
"I've purchased many kinds of screen protectors from PSP to iPod Touch and now my Verizon iPhone. I had purchased a cheap 6 for 2.99 set of protectors and while they were good and easy to apply, it had a matte texture which takes away from the iPhones retina screen. These protectors are crystal clear and was very easy to apply, just follow the directions and you'll have no air bubbles or dust.These are so clear you don't even know there's anything on the phone's screen. I keep my phone in my pocket and don't see any scratches or peeling. The only downside is that you only get two protectors and they are a little costly. You also only get one pre screen cleaner. Its a sticker that removes fine dust etc. So if you have to re apply the second sticker you need to make sure you clean it well since you only get one pre sticker.They are worth the price and have the best reviews out of many others.pros:-crystal clear with no texture, looks and feels like nothing on it.-scratch resistant-easy to applycons:-price-only get two-only one pre cleaning sticker",5
"I've used a lot of their products for iPhones and iPads and they are GREAT. BUT!! They are not worth the extreme prices. You can get a 3 pack of screen protectors from Tech Armor that I feel are about the same quality and fit for only $6 or $7 for a 3 pack, rather than $20 for a 2 pack.",4
This case looks just like the picture and is very pretty. Ive had it for about 3 months now and its been fading and the pictures starting to chip bit by bit. Also it fits my iphone 4 very loosely.,4
I really liked this product. I didn't have any issues with it. The case is very unique and colorful as well.,5
"This case is a very fun color and print, however I did have a little issue with it snapping together. IT held on but if dropped it immediately went apart. I did love it and do recommend it though.",4
I like this case for my iphone4  it has style an it's easy to put on an take it offI would recommend this case for your iphone4..,5
"This case was great, I used it for so long that eventually the design started to peel off and it got dirty since it was white. But I used it for months and the tree picture was awesome. Great product.",5
"i love this case, a lot! the only thing i dislike is that the design rubs off. very much worth my money still.",4
"Ok so the worst thing about this case also happens to be the best thing! The case is very difficult to take a part once on your iphone, but the bonusto that is that it doesn't just fall off your phone when dropped!!",4
My kids love this case. The design and colors are exactly as they show and the case fits perfectly. I recommend this case!,5
"This is on of my new favorite phone cases. It's light, sturdy, thin, and pretty. I use this one quite often.",5
"Shiny case, but I thought it would be more realistic.  Overall, not a bad phone case.  One thing is this phone case is a bit slippery, but it didn't cause me too much trouble.",4
Just what I was looking for ... Such a great case got lots of compliments on it. It arrived on time and in great shape and with a great price could not pass it up...,5
"The case came new like it said it would. The tree was just gorgeous, it's a snap on case, which I never owned before, it's easy to put on and take off. I love the case but my sister loved it more, so I handed it over. It has a little tiny space on the side to make it easier to remove the case. And for Verizon phones it has a cut out for the side. Mines a sprint so ICK! Everything is easy accessible. Cutouts are made for the buttons. And to charge the cutout is precise. Once again I'm happy with a purchase from amazon. If you have any questions you can email me at cpurdyx@aim.com. I know how people lie to make a product sound better but no BS here. Ill send photos because this case is GREAT!",4
"Considering the really cool design I went ahead and purchased this for my wife after a few days it fell apart, save your money!",1
"I used this one for February since i hate winter and love hearts and PINK, perfect match. Don't you think?",4
I have several covers I can swap out when the mood comes over me to change.  I like that and will probably choose more at a later date.,4
"its alright. but for some reason i thought it was white with the markings,. not like a see through gray.",2
"I'm a case lover. I probably have 4 different cases that I rotate between. I like the slick feel and I like that I have full access to all the iPhone buttons.I will say that I dropped my phone over the weekend and the case did come completely apart, but my iPhone was not damaged. I should probably put one of those stickers on the front of my screen, but I don't like the way they feel overall.For the price, I would DEF recommend this case. If you don't like it, send it to me and I'll pay you for it. haha",5
I love the design on this case. So much that i actually bought another when the first started cracking. The quality isn't the best but for the price what can you expect. It does its job and protects my phone and looks awesome. For the price i will definitely reorder when/if this one breaks,3
"got this for my wife's new iphone, its cheap, works.and  looks great, works on in cradle, looks different than everyone elses",5
Looks a lot nicer on a white iPhone. I liked how it snapped together and there's a little bumper space on the front of the phone but it bothered me a lot when I actually used the phone. I liked it while i had it.,3
Has a really good fit. I got some use out it but it ended up cracking when I dropped my phone. Phone was still okay but the case was done.,3
I bought two of these for me and my bestfriend and we loved them. Everyone is always commenting on how cute the cases look and where we got them.,5
"I love the design on the back of the case. It's perfect for me.  The customer service with this cover is amazing also. The only thing I have to say is that in the picture online it shoes the front cover as being solid white and when you get it, it has branches from the back on it and they don't match the picture. That's the only thing I don't like. My friend has the same one and she loves it.",4
Usually when you have a case that is plastic it is supposed to SNAP together around your phone..yeah it doesn't do that. It literally sits on the phone and comes completely off as soon as you move it. Plus it had a huge chunk taken out of one of the openings. It's a cute case but it's 100% useless.,1
"This was cute but poorly made! The edges were all rugged and rough and the front part of the cover was broken! I was disappointed because it was so adorable! I tried to fix it, but no luck! I hope your case comes in better shape!",1
"This is a really cute case, not so much white as it is silver. And it comes in 2 pieces that 'snap' together, really hard to take apart, but at least it looks cute!",5
"Terrible quality. Will never purchase one like it again. The design started rubbing off within days of purchasing it. Also the colors were not as vibrant as pictured, almost not even the same colors. Not happy at all.",1
this case was extremely hard to get off and i would not recommend. Its pretty but very difficult. no good,1
"i like the leopard print on the case, i actually love anything with leopard print. i have not used this product as of yet.",4
Nice case. Colors aren't as vibrant as the colors in the image but it does look really nice. Only downside is is that it's difficult to take off the phone. I had to use a butter knife to pry at the edge a bit to remove it.,4
"My phone dropped maybe 2 feet on its back.  This case, because it is hard plastic, did not protect my phone and the back of my phone is shattered.  Go for a rubber case",1
"This case is good for the price. It is cheaply made but does look cute on your phone. I probably wouldn't buy again, but again it was cute for the price.",3
I bought this for my wife as she wanted to new cover that looked different than the regular white & black covers available. This is an okay cover but pls mind that this has a very glossy finish & can easily slip if not take appropriate care. Although it is not a hard protective case but this can potentially damage your iPhone as well if not handled carefully.,2
I paid 20 cents for this case it is very cute on I have dropped my phone a few times and it has protected my phone. the only down fall is that it is very complicated to get off.,4
This case was very pretty on my phone and with it having a top and bottom section it covered a little more than the other covers.,4
"This case is perfect.  Cute little plastic case that snapped right on my iphone 4.  The colors are vibrant and look just like they did in the picture.  I'm not very rough on my phone, it's a personal phone that doesn't see hours of action, so this case is going to be perfect for me!",5
"Getting it on (it's 2 pieces) wasn't hard, but getting it back off requires that you press in two clips on either side at the same time, which is a little awkward.The artwork is OK.  Not sure what I was expecting.",3
"This case has been great!!  I've had it for about 4 months now and the color on the edges has worn off, but for $2 to help protect something I use 30 times a day, I will consider this purchase a success!  I like to change my covers often, so again, for the price, I have really enjoyed this product.",5
"I am really clumsy so this one cracked right away, but if you are not hard on phone cases than this is a good one.",2
"Got it for my wife and it was pretty ugly and cheap looking, but its was cheap so I wasn't expecting anything great.",2
"Ive had this for months and drop my phone daily and it holds up like a champ. It's so cute! The seller is great too my first one was damaged and they sent me a new one ASAP. Will definitely buy from the, again.",5
This case is a hard plastic and fits my phone. (iPhone 4S) It is a very cute case. I highly recommend for your phone.,5
"i love this case! this is used mostly for my everyday use. very prompt shipment - received it quicker than my other cases, and very inexpensive. i like how it's a 2-piece case. very durable and pieces fit securely, dont come apart easily. awesome design you can match it with almost anything.",5
The only thing I  didn't like about this case was that it's rubberized so the white parts of the case got dirty really fast.,3
Shipped very fast and price was very great. Didn't really like the case too much cause it was very slippery. The leopard pattern was beautiful though. Snapped on very tight. Not a bad case.,4
"Simply put, this case chipped away very easily. It does not look the way it looks in the picture anymore",3
But I tell you it stains soooo easy! I wanted to keep it on for a while but I got grossed out by how my make-up stained it! Cute case but I would suggest it to non-makeup users!,2
"So this is a pretty cell phone case. The material isn't enough to protect your phone if you drop it, given the material it's made of. But depending on how you accidentally drop it, with less force, the case will sustain your phone. Also, it's pretty light, so it's not tiring to hold or carry your phone. I also liked that it's easy to put together. It's not like other phone cases where it's kinda difficult to snap the pieces together.",5
This case is not worth it. It takes forever to come and although it is pretty it gets dirty looking super fast. Not worth the hassle.,2
get what you pay for i guess. Two pieces of flimsy plastic that seems very very breakable if you are rough with it. cute though,3
"I bought this for like $2, it arrived quickly and was exactly as described. Almost every case I've cheaply bought has always been junk, but this one is definitely worth buying! I used it for almost a year, barely got dingy, and was a great case. Just wanted to switch it up after a year and got a different design.",5
thank u same as pic ... would purchase again .. xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xdx,5
"I bought this because it was super cute and I normally don't like snap cases... I LOVE THIS!  I was a little upset that when I received it, it was broken... I contacted the seller and they were GREAT!!! I actually received it less than two weeks!  I thought this was handled very well!!  I would recommend this product to anyone as well as this seller.  Great experience overall!",5
"Hard case, two pieces, fits perfect. Product base color looks white in picture. It is actually silver. Well what i recived was a silver base. Case was still pretty.",4
"I just bought the new IPhone 16g white with the siri and I love it but with how expensive they are I wanted to make sure that I had a case, I ordered this one and got it within two days!!I fell in love with it! I showed it off to all my collegues and they thought for 1$ that it was a steal! Only bad part was it had a scratch but who cares! It fit's wonderful totally worth the buy",5
"Definitely feels like it will protect my Nexus One better than any other case. Caveats are: swiping and tapping through the screen shield is significantly less responsive, and it's harder to get at the edges of the screen because of the raised lip of the protector.I also have an OtterBox Defender for my Galaxy Nexus, and these issues are not as severe with that combination.",3
"my phone broke 3 days after buying it! Now granted, it fell flat on its face and the amoled screen underneath the top screen broke...and there wasn't any protection from a flat on it's face fallBut, I've had otterboxes before, and I would still get an otterbox. Just not this variety. Stick with the more rubberized cases for better protection.",3
"Got this for my then new Nexus One, the case protects the phone well but it breaks too often.  Got a replacement form Otterbox every three months until eventually they stop making it .",2
Bought this and the Seidio Rugged at the same time. Like this one a lot more. The design is sleeker and the integrated screen protector is awesome. Will never run phone without an Otter again.,5
"I really love this Otter case, and for less than nine bucks with free shipping (prime) it is a heck of a deal. I don't use the belt clip stuff.  That just seems like a hassle.  I was always worried about keeping my phone in my pocket for fear that my keys would scratch it up.  Now it's like a tank and there are no worries. The screen seems just as responsive.  It's a little tough to grab the notifications from the top, so I just use the menu>notifications sequence instead - a minor adjustment and not at all inconvenient.  I open it up weekly to clean the inside of the screen, as it tends to attract some gunk - maybe a little moisture.  Overall very happy, and I would highly recommend this case.",5
"For less then $5.00, this was an absolute steal. This case plus the belt clip is great! The case is easy to put on and doesn't have a sticky-rubbery feel like some cases do, it easily slides out of the pocket. This thing is a tank! Too bad the Nexus One isn't a &#34;top of the line&#34; phone anymore, at least this case is!",4
"I've had Otterbox cases before, so when I saw this for $8.95 on Amazon I jumped on it. See my pro's and con's below:Pros:Multiple layers of protection: First, you place the phone in a plastic case that snaps together and then that gets covered by a piece of tight fitting silicone. Makes for a durable case.Built-in screen protector: The plastic case has a built in screen protector. I was skeptical at first, thinking it would scratch and cause a lot of glare, but it's really nice and covers the entire phone.Belt Clip: The belt clip that comes with the case is a nice bonus.I also like that the charging port and headphone port get covered. You pull back the silcone to access them. As you know, the Nexus One is notorious for allowing dust to get under the screen, so having every hole covered is great.Cons:Touch to remove: The silicone is easy to get off, but it takes a bit more work to get the plasic cover off.Lint: The silicone cover collects a log of lint, so I recommend using the belt clip.Overall, I would recommend this to a friend. It was cheap (at least on Amazon) and does the job perfectly. As stated above, the attached screen cover is a nice feature as now I won't have to change screen covers every month or so when they wear out.I hope this helps.Nick****Update 9/6/12****Unfortunately I had to stop using the case. As noted in some other reviews, the proximity sensor occasionally gets blocked, and this severely impacts the use of the phone while on a call. There were points where I could not hang up the phone because of this problem. It's a bummer, as it's a really nice case, just not nice enough to outweigh that big problem.",4
"What more can I say, it is an otterbox.  You want the best?  Buy something like this and you will be happy.",5
"I had bought this model to gift it for someone special. When I bought it, the price was $249 - now it has come down by $30 over nearly 5 months.She used to play a lot of youtube videos over WiFi and stuff - I know she liked it a lot and didn't have any problems...",5
"Please beware that you cannot download the Nokia Ovi Suite because it currently supports only Windows.  I binged the Internet to look at a roadmap and don't see any hope that Mac machines will be supported at all.The Nokia Software Updater and Maps Uploader apps for Mac do not recognize this phone at all despite successful OTA software update.  The Media syn app also doesn't recognize the phone and so I could't upload music to this device.It is a resistive screen and touch response for me is adequate.  It may be deemed slow or trash, but hey touch screen response is very subjective.  At times the screen would turn white for a second, usually when you slide out the keypad.I like the physical keyboard.  Battery is more than average.  The first full charge did not last a day despite the phone mostly on idle.  The second charge lasted 2 days with apps running.I like the free Ovi Maps the most.  This is probably the phone's best asset.I also like the Facebook ticker.  It seems to me that this is the 'Facebook phone.'.  Albeit, the typeface is small due to cramped screen.  Also, I never like the legacy Nokia font which existed since my Nokia 5110i.  The FB ticker shows random contacts.  Can't change that to your inner circles.I also like the feel of physical answer/hang-up buttons.  The phone is good quality plastic, the screen however cheap looking.This phone is the low-end ver of Nokia N97 Mini.I am bothered by Nokia's lack of support for US market bec software updates are apparently released first in EU and Asia for similar handset in the US.",5
"Buen producto,, todo excelente,, pero tenia un problema con el bot&oacute;n de c&aacute;mara, no funciono.",3
"04/05/2012 UPDATE: I want to do a quick comparison between the Nokia C6-00 and Android phones, specifically Samsung Nexus S by Google. I've been using the Google android phone for the past 11 months and it did EVERYTHING I needed it to do from paying for Starbucks coffee using a Starbucks app so I didn't need to carry my Starbucks card around and accessing multiple MS Exchange accounts to the interface and OS being slick and nimble as well as Google directions/mapping/GPS; the MAJOR downside to smartphones such as Android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the OS and display especially. I could not last more than 6-8 hours on Android and this is with setting the Display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight. That was the ONLY issue with my Android. Anyway, it did everything I needed so I stuck with it. Until recently the sounds stopped working. So I sold it and now I am back with Nokia. The strength of Nokia is the battery lasts a good 14-15 hours on standby (not sure why this Amazon description states 16 days or so, no, 15 hours, so at the end of the day before going to bed, you need to charge it up again for the next day). I can only add ONE MS Exchange email account on Nokia and I also have Gmail installed. The OS is not as slick and fast as Android and there is a 'white screen' lag, but you put up with it. The sounds, ringing, call quality and reliability of the Nokia as a PHONE first and foremost is second to none. The Android (Samsung) had low ringing volume even at maximum. Also Sprint service for the Android was weak in my area, so ATT under Nokia was better. The Nokia is a 'workhorse' of a phone that is loud (volume, I like!) and does a barely ok job at being a 'smart phone.' I will keep using it for now because of long battery life and I can switch out the SIM card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone, esp. overseas like Europe (ATT only charges $10 month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum $30 for smart phone). Will I eventually switch to a smart phone when something I like comes out, YES, of course, the Android experience (except for battery life) did EVERYTHING I needed a smartphone to do (rich apps for banking, Starbucks, etc) and my LIFESTYLE. What will I look for in a smart phone next time? STRONG BATTERY LIFE (EASILY LASTING 15 HOURS ON STANDBY OR BASICALLY WHAT I CALL A 'WHOLE DAY' BEFORE CHARGING AT NIGHT), LOUD RINGER AND VOLUME, 4G CAPABILITY, HANDLE MULTIPLE MS EXCHANGE EMAIL ACCOUNTS.06/20/2011 UPDATE: Bought this phone in September 2010. There is still a slight lag (in the form of a 'white screen') in between applications but other than this and the slight heft (weight) to the phone, it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone. For a while the Ovi maps and Ovi store apps did not work, I finally figured out I needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload Ovi maps and Ovi store. The trick is it is a Catch 22, you cannot download Ovi maps with Ovi store (the PC sync did not work for me in the first place), and you cannot if Ovi store did not work, I finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once I go Ovi store working, downloaded Ovi maps and then everything works now. The music was a trick, you need to sync to your PC and copy and paste to the C6 after created a 'Music' folder, then in the C6 press music and then library and then 'Options' and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up, otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while, you need to manually refresh the music library!I added somore more apps like a flashlight and games, etc. It is 100% working and a nice little phone. However, my main phone is a Samsung Nexus S 4G from Sprint because it is a PURE GOOGLE experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because I rely on gmail and Google calendar and Google everything apps, it just works for me. This C6 is a travel phone for me, for example I also have a Motorola Ming A1200 flip phone I used in Europe and the C6 will also be a travel phone for me when I do not need to take my larger Nexus S 4G with me traveling. So the C6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time I took it I went to Idaho and Oregon on business) because the battery life on the C6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone Ming A1200 was even better, a few days battery. The Nexus S 4G I charge every night and can't beat the apps and user experience on nexus S.Recommendation is 3 stars now from 2 stars. I would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen. Everything works on it though, but with MS Exchange you can only add one email address so I have a MS Exchange address and a Gmail address, which is basically what I need for email.11/1/2010 UPDATE: HAD THIS PHONE FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW, THE 'WHITE SCREEN' BETWEEN SWITCHING SCREENS, ETC IS GETTING ANNOYING NOW, FOR $300+ OR SO I PAID FOR THIS PHONE I EXPECT A FASTER PROCESSOR. I AM CHANGING MY STARS FROM 4 TO 2; I WOULD NOT BUY THIS IF I KNEW HOW ANNOYINGLY THIS WHITE SCREEN WOULD BE.I am reviewing Nokia C6 here first since I had time to play with it, I will review the N900 soon in a bit under the N900 product site on Amazon (I reviewed the N900 on 10/13/10 so look for it under my 'Kingmonkey' ID). The C6 . . . I couldn't decide between Nokia N900 and C6 (did not want new N8 coming out end of September 2010 since there was no physical keyboard), so I bought both N900 and C6. Phones do not come with a case to hold, which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs. For some reason Nokia only sells OEM cases for these phones to the European market, if you go to Amazon UK site or Nokia EU site you will see cases made for N900 and C6, so I had to go to Amazon UK site to order an OEM case for N900; the C6 on Nokia EU site has some nice ones but could not find them on Amazon UK and on Nokia EU site I cannot order them online being from the USA as you need to go to a retail location in Europe. Anyway got some generic case (more like a pouch) for the C6 from Amazon UK.The C6 is a nice looking, stylish phone, good size phone, not too thick or long at all, it's fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy. Made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out, it is stiff and not moving about. The top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way; not a deal breaker for me as I just learn to adapt. Those with bigger hands (fingers) may find the keyboard a little cramped but I wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as Samsung Galaxy or Motorola Droid, so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal. Physically that was the only issue, again, Nokia is stylish, smart looking, and as always, love their Nokia ringtone theme. One last thing on the physical side, being a middle of the road phone (between N8 and lower end Nokia phones) it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price. One feature I wish it had, like the more higher end N900, is a camera lens cover, the camera is just exposed to dust, etc; the C6 does come with a factory 'screen protector' and since this is a new phone and you can't buy a screen protector just yet I suggest leaving it on to protect the screen, since after I set up the C6, the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone (normal use with fingers swiping back and forth, mind you, I take care of my nice things, gently putting it down, wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail, wash my hands and dry them, no lotion, before I handled my phone), so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle. Anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will last.On the software side, the 2GB microsd chip only holds the California map and voice navigation (street names + male voice both for US as two separate files); that's about 2GB total. If you want all of US and other countries, need to buy a 16GB microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigs(I think 16GB additional gigs is the limit the C6 can handle for a microsd card). I don't travel a lot outside of California so it does the job and don't need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, I can wait until I need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.The other major issue is I use Google calendar, right now you can use MS exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports ALL of my gmail contacts into my C6 even though I don't actively keep in touch with all of them, I suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don't remember if this is an option. The calendar also only updates my main Calendar so others I created, including Holidays calendars, bill due date calendars, etc do NOT get imported. This was a deal breaker for me so I deleted this newly created/added gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted, which is what I wanted and it went back to how it was, being empty. By the way when you import this way, any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import, so my one contact I created with a photo and all got overridden with the import. I had to reenter it. Anyway my workaround is to use instead of MS Exchange option on Nokia to add Google accounts like gmail and calendar, etc, I used the 'Gmail' option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well. As for Google calendar, there is a Google Mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for Google Calendar, so for my Internet application I set my default homepage as the Google calendar address so when I want to look at ALL (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my Google calendars I just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by Google. As for the Ovi calendar, don't use it, maybe I'll look at it just to see what day it is every sooften. So I get my Google calendar but via a webpage site, not the Ovi calendar because like I said the MS Exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.I also downloaded OVI software to my PC and the linking between the C6 and Ovi software on my PC works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your PC to the C6, also faster way to update your C6 with software updates since you download them from the PC first and then link your C6 to the PC via a USB cable and the data transfer is faster. Otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the C6, which is slower even using 3G but you can connect to wifi if available using the C6.I customized my desktop icons, which is pretty cool, I added a couple rows of frequent contacts, then 3rd row from top Gmail, then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access, a bookmarked web page, calc, camera, last row has messaging icon, then I downloaded an app for messaging, including google talk, from the Ovi app store by searching for 'messaging'--it's called Nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type, Google talk, Yahoo messenger, whatever . . . at first I was lookign and looking for Google Talk app but it does not exist, you have to access Google talk through this 3rd party app Nimbuzz or something else equivalent (it was a free app) and it works perfectly fine. The C6 home screen icons,being Symbian software based, is a bit 'cartoonish' when compared to more sophisticated phones like the N900 or Droid icons or Blackberry 9000 Bold, but it's fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the C6 menu and navigation as discussed above.Overall I am happy with the Nokia, good size, small bar type smart phone, good looking, quality materials. The C6 is Symbian based and my N900 is Maemo based so another reason I bought both to compare and see how I like them. C6 works with ATT 3G so since I have an existing ATT SIM card it works great, the N900 I signed up for a T-Mobile individual plan text+web+voice and the N900 3G only works with TMobile 3G, So I am set here; if I used the ATT SIM card the ATT 3G does not work with Nokia N900 and would have to settle for EDGE (non 3G). Email me at darian.chin at gmail dot com if you have questions.",3
"I like the phone a lot and it worked very well for me the first couple of weeks. It has many features and I am still discovering new ones. The GPS works great and the maps are current.However, the manual is not good. Many features simply have to be discovered by accident or because a friend knows them. A comprehensive version for download what be great.It also takes some time to understand the logic behind when to close, exit, or disconnect an application. The wrong button can eat up battery power, and you don't even know why.Finally, get a big memory card with the phone (8 or 16 gb).The application store is nice, but no comparison with the apple offers, but that may come.Overall a reliable phone that works well and still shows new stuff every day.",4
"I loved this phone, the only problem I had with it and it's because I'm near sided and hate to wear my glasses unless I'm going to read the bible, is that the view is too small for me.  If the screen was a little bigger I would have given it five (5) stars.  The WI FI worked perfectly, the volume was perfect.  I titled it a 'mini computer' because it keeps you in touch with the world.",4
Phone came with a damaged screen. I live outside the US so now i have to accept my faith...Shame on you Amazon...,1
great product.  very easy install.  we went from having to step outside to talk to people before zboots to now being able to have good quality conversation anywhere in the house.,5
"First of all, it does boost the signal. The only problem is that i have to have my phone a few feet away from the unit to get a better signal. Not near the advertised 2500 square foot range. more like 10 square ft range. I dont see much of any options on boosting the signal to a wider area either.",3
"Perfect condition.Easy installationCompact and small.the price is perfect and reasonable for what you get.The quality of signal is not good, sometimes, you get good signal, sometimes not. although the antenna i placed in a full signal area.",3
"I think the product is great and ZBoost customer service is great but consumers need to know that this product has limitations.  Here is some things that were not mentioned in other review.  My home is new and I have a sophisticated structured wiring system.  I get very good reception in the attic (installed antenna) but lousy, if any, reception in basement/home office so this seemed to be a perfect solution.  There are two problems that you need to be aware of.  Max length between antenna and base is 75 ft and only if you use good R6. According to ZBoost customer service it must be a single strand (no female connectors).  Structured wiring uses connectors to route R6 to the proper location and the distance for me was probably 100 ft  or more from antenna to base due to the nature of the wiring. If either of these requirements cannot be met the signal just won't happen.  Not just my opinion, Zboost customer service was both honest, sympathetic and verified that my house was not going to work with a structured wiring system unless I reran a new single strand cable. The other problems are well described in other reviews so I won't repeat them.4/9/2011 Update:  Purchased Samsung repeater direct from Verizon for $249.99.  This unit plugs into your ethernet.  It basically becomes a mini cell tower with it's own gps antenna.  My signal jumped to full bars.  Pro:  Price is equal or lower than Zboost with no monthly fees and guaranteed full strength signal in throughout the whole house.  Con:  Only accepts Verizon outbound service so if you don't have Verizon don't buy it.  7 phone max at one time.",2
"So I have been reading reviews for a week now, ever since I changed from AT&T; to T-Mobile and lost ALL service at my house. So here's how I set it up:It's on a 21' aluminum pole on the side of my house where I get 1 bar of Edge serviceThe repeater is in my home office, directly below the antennaI started with the 50' roll of (mini) cheap wire that came with the unit and put it in every room I could reach. My office was the best place for a signal. If I am within 20' of the repeater, I now get 2 to 3 bars of 4G coverage. The far 2 bedrooms are still dead zones. Anything further than 20' drops off to 1 bar if I'm lucky. Download speeds are 6.08 Mbps within 10' of the base unit. I read where all the reviewers were buying good, dbl shielded RG6 wire and having dramatic changes for the better, so off to the electronics store I went - $22 later and the performance on speedtest.net app dropped to 4.06 Mbps. Switch back to the included wire, back up to 6.05. I don't know what to say about that!Here's a very strange finding! In my back yard where there was ZERO service before, I now have 2 to 3 bars of 4G, with download speeds of 5 to 8Mbps - this being 45' + from the base unit! It seems the further away I am, the better the signal.Bottom line? Most of my house (2700 sq ft) now has Edge (some 4G) with 1 to 2 bars. I was NOT able to make a call before installing the unit, and now I can make and receive calls from anywhere in the house except the 2 furthest bedrooms where it is still a dead zone. If you have a small house, probably up to 1300 sq ft or so, it'll probably work well for you, but I don't see this working on any large home. In my office, 16' x 30', I get full signal, 4G for about half, the other half, 3 to 4 bars, 4G.I guess it does what I need at the bare minimum, which is allows me to get voice and text from most of the house, even if the signal is very weak - before I had no service anywhere.As a side note, the antenna and the mounting bracket that comes with this kit are very fragile. If you mount the antenna on the included bracket, it will bend in the wind... seriously. Get a better bracket from Home Depot or you will be changing it.",3
"I did a bunch of research.  zBoost seemed to get the best reviews.  Don't even think this, or any, booster will be effective in the whole house.  The room with the booster will be the room to call from.  Very much line of sight performance.  But in that room... not bad.",3
The product does seem to increase the available signal(s) from nearby towers but i have sprint and my nearby tower has a strong Verizon signal.  so it boosted the Verizon signal but not the sprint signal ( I still have to go to my attic or out on my lawn to not drop a call.Called sprint.  they said get an airave.  I did. and it works better for me.I still think this product is good but have heard from some that you should get a better antenna cable.  prob a good idea.,3
"Put the external antenna in the attic, ran the co-ax down a central pluming column, put the unit in the basement - I now have perfect cell signal in my entire underground basement and much better signal on the first floor.  I did have to pay attention to the aluminum foil wrapped, tin heating and air ducts in the basement in considering placement.Setup was easy and quick.  Omni directional antenna is perfect for putting the unit in the middle of an area.",5
"Something you might want to do is have a high quality RG6 wire to run between the antenna and the Zboost base. The hardware stores in my area Menards, Lowes, Home Depot, Ace will cut and terminate wire to your specifications for a few dollars. I found the provided  RG6 wire to be poorly insulated and lacking quality. I ran and terminated 40ft of wire I acquired at Menards, and I didn&#8217;t even bother with the RJ6 they sent.1) Place the antenna to give you steady signal quality. I tested several positions before I found the ideal spot. Outside mounted to a shed. I used a sidewalk edger to drop and bury the RJ6 under three inches of soil and covered it up. I also cut some PVC pipe in half to protect the wire from rodents and weed whackers where the ground met the wire on the side of the buildings.2) Keep the antenna away from the base station separated by walls",5
"tried this piece of junk at three different sites including a customers 3 story house, a boyscout campground, and a two story house. i had better  reception without it on. i even tried running the antenna up a flag pole. when i called tech suppport for an RMA i got such brilliant questions as &#34;did you try using it where you had a weak signal.&#34; DUH.  thats why i wanted it!!  Other tech support comments were &#34;well, you cant use the omni directional antenna that comes with it, you need a directional antenna.&#34;  finally, tech support said, well, we can RMA it if you like, but i doubt it will help. Email me your receipt and ill issue an RMA.  did that twice.  still no RMA.  looks like this is going to be one expensive skeet.  at least ill have fun blowing the hell out of it with a gun.",1
"This review ran a bit longer than I expected, so let me sum it up by saying that this zBoost SOHO YX545 did exactly what I needed it to.  It boosts the signal quality in my house from at most 2 bars to a solid 5 and didn't require any complicated setup or configuration.  It isn't often that a plug-and-play device like this truly beats out all expectations!The main thing to keep in mind during the install is that the external antenna and base station need to be seperated as much as possible.  The reason for this is that they both use the same frequencies for communication, and having them close together will cause feedback.  When the zBoost detects feedback, it turns down its internal antenna strength; which can seriously impact the range you will get from the zBoost.Now, on to the details:I live in a 2 story, 3000 square foot house with a radiant barrier installed in the attic.  The radiant barrier is great for keeping utility costs down, but it wreaks havoc on the cell signal in the house.  Because of that, I'm lucky to get 1 or 2 bars inside, with constant missed and dropped calls, even though the signal quality outside is just fine.For the last 3 years I've been working from home and using an AT&T; cell phone as my primary work number.  This has led me to try all types of methods to boost my cell signal, and I'm often forced to take work calls in the yard since it's the only place where my phone works.Last week I discovered the zBoost SOHO YX545 and decided to give it a try.  One of the first things I noticed after unpacking it was that the 50' extension cable seemed extremely thin and poorly insulated compared to a standard coax/RG6 cable.  I decided I'd use it anyway, so I headed up to the roof to find a place with a good cell signal.  The antenna was extremely easy to mount - I basically used the included screws to mount it to my chimney in a place where it looked like there was a good signal.After mounting the antenna, I ran the included COAX cable down through the attic and to a central place on the first floor.  I plugged it in and it started up immediately, no configuration or long boot process at all.  I checked my phone and, honestly, I wasn't very impressed.  In fact, my signal wasn't much better than what it had been before.At that point I was a bit frustrated, but decided not to give up yet.  I went back to the roof to verify the antenna location and it turned out I hadn't picked a very good spot.  I moved it and went back in to test again.  The second time, my signal was better; but it dropped off quickly just a few feet away from the zBoost device.This whole time, the quality of the 50' extension cable had been in the back of my mind - so I decided to replace it with a better-insulated RG6 cable.  I also decided to go with a 35' cable just to keep the cable run to a minimum.  Running the replacement cable was easy enough since I just used a coax coupler to connect the cables and pulled the new cable all the way to the roof - it only took a few minutes.Once I had connected the new RG6 cable, I plugged in the zBoost and finally got the results I had been hoping for!  My whole house is now bathed with a consistent 4 to 5 bar signal quality, and my cell phone calls are sounding better than they ever have before.  This is one of the best investments I've ever made!The entire install time was around 5 hours - and that included a trip to Home Depot.  If you are just mounting the antenna outside a window, I would expect the install time to be far less.  In my case, I always like to run wires through the walls and that can add quite a bit of time - especially going from the roof to the first floor.After trying every cell booster device I could find, including the 3G MicroCell from AT&T; (which gave good signal strength, but ended up causing far more problems than it solved), I've finally found a device that solves my home's signal issues.  I can't say enough good about the zBoost, and I'm happily giving it 5 well-deserved stars.If you do buy this, here is a summary of the things that should help you get a better signal boost:1) Make sure the antenna truly is in a place that will give you a consistent signal quality.  My first attempt at mounting the antenna picked a bad spot because I didn't realize how long my phone takes to update the signal strength meter.  The second time, I held it in place for about a minute in each location to be sure I really did have a good signal.2) Keep the antenna as fully seperated from the base station as possible - open air distance won't work great for this, but wall and ceiling materials will.  In my house, the radiant barrier actually helps the zBoost out since it keeps the base station from seeing the antenna at all.3) If your antenna and base station are well seperated and the zBoost signal still seems to be dropping off after only a few feet - try using a better insulated RG6 cable instead of the cable included with the zBoost.  My suspicion is that the ultra-thin coax cable was allowing the zBoost base station and the antenna to interfere with each other, even though they were seperated by 2 ceilings, attic insulation, a roof, and the radiant barrier.  Fortunately, good RG6 cables can be had for not much money at all.4) Remember that shorter cable runs are better than longer runs.  For example, avoid using a 50' coax cable for a 25' run.  Home Depot will cut cables to custom lengths, and you can probably talk most of the guys into terminating them for you if you don't have the tools.  Otherwise, just get a pre-terminated 25' or 50' cable (which is still just a few bucks).Overall, I highly recommend this product.  If you have a good cell signal outside, but not inside, then this is the product that will solve your connectivity problems!",5
"I am a freak at insulating my home.  Aluminum roof and radiant foil barrier under all the siding of the house, metal is bad for limiting cellphone signals.  Signal went from good to terribly poor. I could sometimes get a good signal if I stood at the windows of the home but no where else. I saw the SOHO YX545 and thought &#34;give it a try&#34;.  I installed the antenna on the roof on the end of a 4 ft pole to get the best signal.  I purchased a better 25ft cable, the cheapo one that came with the unit was said (according to other reviewers) to be rubbish.  I ran the cable down the side of the house in to the boiler room, I made sure that the antenna was at least 15 ft in elevation from the unit in the home (VERY IMPORTANT for good Signal).  Powered off my phone and powered on the unit, once my phone powered back on I got full bars and crisp reception for all calls.  I should have purchased a unit that could boost 4g signal too but this is perfectly good enough for me.",5
this booster...in a word...works!It does what it says...and extends range from 1500-2000 feet in areas that have poor cellular coverage.,4
"Doesn't works, I have the same problem, no phone signal, no recommended",1
"The location - remote cabin near lakeThe equipment - AT& T service, AT&T; Fusion phone, and a iPad (second gen)I didn't have vey high hopes for this and I was sure I was going to be returning it.  But no! It works great and better than expected.  I used a 100 foot coax cable I had in place of the 50 foot one that was included.  They don't recommend this but it works just fine. I mounted the antennae on a ladder and moved around the cabin until I found the strongest signal (and convenient place to mount it).  Then I plugged it in and watched my signal go from 1-3 bars of EDGE network to 3-5 bars of 3G.  Then I unplugged it and watched the signal degrade.  On some days I would have 3G signal out here so I tested it over the course of a couple of weeks and weather conditions to make sure I just wasn't having a good reception day.  With this unit,  I would always have 3G, but the signal would be 4-5 bars somedays and 2-3 bars other days.  Without the unit I could't use my iPad most days and call quality was poor on my phone.  The signal, with the unit, is always stronger on my iPad than phone though.  Then I mounted it near the roofline and I'm good. My one complaint is that the signal boost is only good for about 200-300 feet from the unit.  Not thousands.  A neighbor came over with their Verizon iPhone and iPad and although they had a strong signal, they could not use their services.  I don't know what that is all about, but AT&T; works great.",5
"We just moved from a very strong signal area to a very low signal area (it varies from 3 bars to Searching depending on the alignment of the stars and if a butterfly is flapping its wings), and I had to beg AT&T to give me a deal on their microcell booster...and when that didn't perform up to standards, we figured we'd try this signal booster (on the recommendation of a friend). Well, unfortunately, this one turned out to be an even bigger back of suck than the AT&T one. We couldn't get up to our roof peak, but my husband mounted it outside the second story office window (temporarily on a broom stick to get it higher) and inside the office 10 feet away we had one bar. He moved it around the house and outside other windows to no better effect. One or two bars every time. Well, we got better with the AT&T one, so there is no way I was spending twice the amount on this item.",1
"My phone: MyTouch 4GMy carrier: T-MobileMy location: MinnesotaI am one of many people who find it difficult to justify paying for both a cell phone and a home phone. It's just too costly. A negative with this is that a cell requires a stable signal. In my office at home, which is located in my half-basement, the signal constantly drops out.As someone who works from home one day a week, I can't have this. I need my phone to work at all times, which is why I looked into this wireless extender. At first, I was reluctant to pay a couple hundred dollars for something that's really just a modified router. But, since it is sold by Amazon, I knew that I could try it out and return it without a hassle should it not work out. So I gave it a shot.Since the prospect of drilling holes and running a wire through my walls was less than appealing--before I went to all that trouble--I tested positioning the antenna at different places in my house. At first, I received a full 4-bars on my phone, but after a minute or so, it dropped down again. I thought something was wrong with the extender, but found that there really isn't a great signal in and around my house anywhere. To test this, I installed a Mobile Signal Widget on my Android phone, and then walked around my house, yard, and the top of my roof. What I found was an intermittent signal everywhere.Eventually, I came across a place at the front of my house that stayed around 3-bars on average. On top of that, the signal never dropped out, so I went ahead and installed the antenna at that location (by mounting it to the outside of my house (unit comes with a mounting bracket)). I then ran the included cable (which is quite long) underneath my siding and drilled a small 1/2' hole into the wall that goes into my office. From there I ran the cable through the hole, mounted the unit to the inside wall, and plugged up the hole with calk and insulation.Now my phone seems to stay around 4-5 bars, which is great because the outside signal is only around 3. So far, it hasn't dropped the signal yet, so I'm happy. Where I still believe the price for the unit is higher than it should be, I'm willing to eat the cost to have a working phone in my home office. Overall, $200 is still cheaper than paying $50 a month for another phone line.",4
"This is my second one of these. When i first purchased these they work great for about a year. Then they pretty much die. Even after power cycling it, the boosted signal only lasts for about 30 secs. before it dies. We have switched phone providers since this purchase, i might give it a third times a charm and buy one on the correct band for VZW and give it a try.",3
WOW!!! Works great. Put it up on the roof. Protected it with pvc and it does great. Went from 1 bar to full bars.,5
"I really wanted to write a review of this item.  I keep seeing low ratings, and I really don't know why.  I had a zBoost for a couple of years, and it worked perfectly in my 2000 square foot ranch.  we had virtually no service.  Put the antenna in the attic, and mounted the base unit on the ceiling in the middle of the house.  2 bars right under the unit, 5 bars in the basement. All this with maybe 1 or 2 bars outside the home.Well the wife got a work phone that wasn't covered by the single band width unit, so we bought the zBoost Metro.  Didn't have the signal boost of the full size unit, but it worked.  Went from 1 bar close to the unit, to 3 in the basement.Well due to 5 years of use and a bunch of power spikes, the metro unit burned out.  We decided to go back to the full size unit.  Same result.  Antenna in the attic, unit in the main hall.  2 bars under the unit, 5 in the basement with AT&T;, Tmobile goes from 0 to 3 bars near the unit, 3 bars in the basement.I have to wonder what the variable is.  These units all worked perfect.  Heck, the metro's antenna was supposed to be a window mount, and me being too cheap to purchase a new antenna, I just duct taped it to a joist in the attic.  Our house is older and made of plaster and lathe construction, making radio waves stop at the front door.  I have to assume the bad reviews have a variable I am not seeing.  I can say that if you follow the install instructions and the base unit is at least 15 feet from the antenna,  and there is some sort of signal outside the home, they work great!",5
"I think the unit kind of work, or the unit I received was semi-defective.I got 4 to 5 bars outside and on the roof, but most of the house has only 1 or 2 bars max, and inside the bedroom I get 0 to 1 bar.  I need something affordable to boost the signal.  This model of zBoost seems ok.  I did everything per instruction, I placed at the center of the house, which is the living room.It works, I get 5 bars ( -65dBm) if I am 5 feet next to it at the living room or 4 bars if I am at the end of the leaving room, 30 feet away.  I got only 1 to 2 bars (-95 to - 98 dBm ).  However, the signal starts to drop fast after 1 wall.  In the first room next to the living room.  The signal is always between 2 to 3 bars.  it got worst to the room behind the first room.  It was back to 1 bar.",3
"For the price of this unit, I doubt you could find a better one.  I had set up at the hotel that I work at and when the power was turned off everyone asked me if there had been a tower taken down in the local area.",5
"The XY545 SOHO Cell Phone Signal Booster has improved the cell phone reception in our home...but only in certain rooms. If we are standing directly next to it or just a few feet from it...the reception is fairly good (3 or 4 bars). If we wander more than 6 or 8 feet from it while talking on the phone...our bars drop down to 1 or 2. Before we bought the booster, our reception was pretty much 0 inside our home. We are keeping it, but it seems to me to be a little pricey for the results we have gotten with it. We live in a 1300 square foot home and it is just one floor. We were hoping for better results for the money.",3
"Don't waste your money!!! We got 3 bars outside, no bars inside. Installed this and the MEGA SUPER antenna option. Got one bar inside. It does not help my ATT phone or my wife's T-Mobile phone. Do I smell scam?",1
"I bought this about 2 years ago.  I have a metal roof on my house & the cell phone reception inside was HORRIBLE!  The only place our phones would work was if we stood by the windows on the sun porch at the back of my house. Anywhere else in the house we had no service at all.  We live in a very rural area in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.  Total population of about 700 folks, so we are one of the last places to get any kind of upgrades, like 4G, any kind of internet service besides DSL.  Since installing this unit in the house, I have had no problems with cell phone service in my house at all!  I have the unit in my living room & now I even get a signal in my bedroom, which is on the other side of the house from the unit.  The only gripe I have is that the small coil antenna, (that's been working great since I've had it), does not hold up during our harsh winters here.  So I have to find another antenna I can install outside for reception.  Even with the antenna broken off, the unit continues to work just as well as it did before it broke.  My cousin bought a Wilson Cell Phone Booster & I don't see any difference in the reception we get compared to his, except that I paid less than half of what he paid for the Wilson brand!  When I first set installed this unit in my house, I did notice that the red light on the unit would come on now & then.  To correct this, we unplugged the unit from the power source, waited a few seconds & plugged it back in & that took are of the problem.  But we haven't had that issue in over a year.  I don't know why that was happening unless it has to do with our power going out, which is just one of those things we deal with now & then.  As I said before, this has not happened in well over a year, even with the power outages.  Going to search for a replacement antenna right now.I highly recommend this booster!  My uncle lives in this same area & we bought one for him also.  Same unit with the same antenna.  Now he has great reception in his house too.  His has been installed for almost a year now.  No problems!",5
"I got my GF on my phone plane a few months ago and got her a nice htc from tmobile. Everything was great till we moved into our new place.  Now i have the Sidekick from tmobile which will allow me to make phone calls over the wifi, which i figured here phone would too.  But yea, no it didnt which cause her to get very little to no connection.After a few months of her complaining about how crappy the service was, i was faced with two options: buy a landline (20x12months=240) which was more expensive overtime and i would have to buy a house phone, get her another phone but i wouldnt know what to do with her old phone which was still pretty damn new.So i did some research and found these phone boosters, started at around 300 and worked my way to this one.  Still at around 200 i was timid to bite, but after another week of whining from my gf i figured it couldn't be worse then this.Upon receiving i set it up as fast i could to test it out, it was cold and a lil rainy outside but did it anyhow.  I have a antenna i setup when we moved in so i attached it to that and connected it the area where she sits at her computer.  Really easy to setup and install, not much i had to do besides connect things together.Turned it on, crossed my fingers, and looked at my gf's phone.........it went from nothing to 4 full bars!!!!!!!!  But i told her to call her mother, which she did (before she couldn't even get a dial tone) and now she could have a nice very clear conversation. Her mom was surprised since she knows how much she was complaining about bad service.It even gave her 4g (which the product doesnt claim it does, which is strange) connection, mine was only 3g connection over the device but its mainly for her since she got terrible service.  So she is extremely happy with the device and it saved me some money.The product is some what limited when it comes to a wall or something, in the main bedroom where its at i can get 3-4bars if i walk around, 4 bars always when standing within 6ft.But as soon as i walk out the room and get a wall between it and my phone its pretty useless.  Which for the time being is fine with me as i have stated many times before, its for her and those needs have been met.I would highly recommend this product for anyone in a small-medium bedroom that has low connection to buy this product.",5
"Like i said it improved the singal in doors. I think it is important to say that de RG6 cable provide it, it is awful avoid using it, buy a regular one and you would get far better results. I read a review where this issue is metionet and i am really greatfull to that person whe i chance the cable it was important the difference. I Do not remember the name of this person but thank you!",4
"This extender worked great for two weeks, then it utterly failed.  The lights still came on, but the signal returned to its previous (bad) level.",2
"OK here's the sitch.  We would get 1bar 4G on our ATT iPhones at home.  I grew tired of dropped calls or stuttering, so I plunked down the dough hoping this would work, and I'm here to say it does.1 bar increased to 5?  No, more like 1 bar up to 2 from my office 40-feet away from this antenna, but that seems to be all I need.  It will pump up to 3 or 4 bars if I take the phone within 5-feet.I would have given it 5-stars, except that the original power adapter died after 8-months.  I knew it was not working because I started noticing my calls dropping again.  Found a spare 5V adapter and my calls are back loud and clear.",4
"At our home we are in a fringe area on Verizon and AT&T;, getting 1-2 bars, maybe 4, maybe zero bars. Depends on the place in the house, which is very frustrating.I was able to purchase this for $210, which I think is the most it is worth. Yes, it works. Yes, I am able to make calls fairly clearly. I disregarded the included coax and bought by own 50ft RG6 - higher quality and less signal loss.Now that the weather is changing I will have to move the antenna to the very top of the chimney to cope with the signal loss from foliage. There is a tower about 2 miles down the road but the way the terrain is around here, we're lucky to get a bar. I will add more to this review when the antenna is added at the very top of the house. For now, it's in the top corner of the garage (outside), where we can make calls clearly.I wish there was a little more to the front - like blinking activity lights or even a monochrome LCD panel with the amount of phones connected to it and it's RSSI from the antenna would be nice. I think for such a price it would be worth adding those functions. It just shows a green light when it's on, and it goes to red when you get too close or the antenna gets too close.If you have absolutely zero bars outside your house, this will not work. If you get maybe 1-2 bars outside, put this on the highest spot on your house and get RG6 coax instead of the included RG59.All in all, it does do it's job 'okay'. Sometimes I have to get closer to the base station, but this still beats running outside in the freezing cold just to keep a call going. As I said, it's not worth the $399 pricetag. I think $199 is a fair price, especially with the low quality cable that's provided.",3
"For a basement repeater, this one just didn't cut it. No real tangible difference in signal strength with antenna placed outside.Replaced with an equivalent Wilson repeater product, and it smokes this easily. Sad but true!",2
"Have had this running continuously now for three years. Had to mount the antenna externally due to the metal heat reflective coating on our roof decking turns our attic into a Faraday cage. Full bars in the house now, no more dropped calls. Have had three phone talking at the same time in the house with no issues.",5
"I'm not sure that it makes that much of a difference, not sure yet if it was worth the money, it did boost the signal a tiny little bit, I was hoping for much more!",3
"went from zero bars to 4 to 5,range not so great,only about 40 feet but better than zero,swapped the rg.59 cable for rg 6 as rg 59 not worth what its made of and for the price,should be rg 6 included,changing cable added 1 to 2 bars",5
"I installed the Antena in the attic where I get five bars on my cell phone, ran the cable to the receiver and could not get one bar on my phone on the second or first floor.  so I send it back! P-E-R-I-O-D.",1
"I tried this system on 2 different occasions. Neither one was a success. I followed the instructions. I am knowledgeable in electricity and communications but this was not a fix for my whole hose cell solution. I could not identify any improvement using my signal software. I even tried a directional yagi antenna to boost the signal to it with no benefit. The price for the system was good, but without the performance, surely not acceptable. I ended up spending more money, but with a working system from a known competitor.",2
"I bought this unit because I live in a US Cellular low signal area and was unable to get reliable connects in the main floor of my 2 story house. Before installing I read all the reviews and installation tips, and ended up mounting the antenna on my roof, fastened to a short length of PVC pipe.I was unable to use the cheap cable provided because of signal loss and found 50' of high grade cable at Wallmart for $15.I tried several antenna options and found that an old FM signal antenna I had worked much better than the one in the box. This was basically a length of stainless steel wire bent in the shape of a big bow tie (about 6' x 24') so you could probably make one of your own if you're handy.The inside signal booster says it's supposed to cover 3000 Sq.Ft. but don't believe it. You need to stay in the same room as the booster to get any benefit. It doesn't go through walls.I am able to get good call quality and stay connected while in my kitchen now, which was pretty much a dead zone before, so I know the unit is doing something. Just don't expect too much from the range.",3
"Unlike D. Matheny and others, my install wasn't affected by the location of the external antenna or the quality of the coax cable (and I tried changing both). My first install not only didn't help, it actually made things worse. The fix turned out to be to simply move the internal transmitter out of the office where there are LOTS of electronics and into the living room. Just moving it 3ft away from a UPS in the living room added a bar. I had the perfect problem for this device - able to use my cell phone from outside but just not reliably from inside my home built with chicken-wire-stucko walls. The only place in the house where I don't get a solid 4 bars today is back in my office. I ended up with it attached to my chimney, ran the cable down the side of the house, to where I installed a coax wall plate in the living room. UPDATE: I still lose calls - once sitting right next to the inside transmitter. :-(",4
As long as you follow the instructions you will not fail installing this unit.  Take your cell phone in the attic or on the roof to verify you get a good signal there first.,5
"It works but could be a lot better. I put the external antenna on a pole on the roof, and the device in my bedroom that gets 1 bar or no signal. The best I do is 3 bars now but it usually is just 2... I think I will upgrade the coaxial cable since the one provided is really thin.",3
"went through whole pack.  bubbles.  will not recommend this band to others. hope all is going on in your world today.  learn to love each other, immediately.",1
"the Media Devil Magicscreen screen protector was great...installation was a snap after watching the YouTube video describing how to put it on after you have taken a shower:  the fog in the shower knocks the dust out of the air, giving a great, smooth screen!  Good product.",5
"This screen cover was easy to apply and holds up very well. It is the best screen protector I've ever used! I buy a lot of iphone4s products because I'm crazy about my phone! I go overboard on cases, protectors, and accessories in general. After I applied this to my phone, I got one for my boyfriend, bestfriend, sisters, brother, and parents! They all love it. It's so much cleaner-looking than the regular protectors that are shiny and get greasy looking. Also, my makeup doesn't stick to this as much. Great product!",5
"an excellent cover for iphone 4/4s i would buy from them again, it not only helps to avoid the scratches but also keeps the screen from getting all smudgy which i hated thanks to phonedevil iphone 4s cover i dont have a problem any more",5
"Once I put the matte cover on, the clarity of the screen was reduced by 90%. It was so blurry compared to the original retina display that I felt like I was using the original iPhone, not the 4S. I wouldn't recommend using this screen cover if screen resolution is important to you. Instead, you should use the 'Acase(TM) Apple iPhone 4 4S AcaseView Screen Protector Film Clear (Invisible) for iPhone 4 4S AT&T; and Verizon and Sprint (3 Pack + 3 Bonus Back Films)' that is also sold on Amazon.",1
"I have had several iPhones for a few years, and I believe this product to be the best screen protector I have yet used. Itis easy to apply, with no bubbling upon application. It also has been extremely scratch-proof, as attested by my use for thepast several months carrying my phone in my pocket with other objects, and not marring the screen at all.All in all, it has exceeded my expectations in every way! It is easy to view the screen in bright daylight, and very little blurring due to the matte finish. Highly recommend this product to any and all phone owners!",5
"These screen protectors are very nice,good price,and were packaged nicely and arrived in good time. Nice quality and nice price.",5
"If you have any concerns about buying a PhoneDevil product do not.  This company sent me an email after my purchase thanking me for purchasing their product.  I have never had this happen before.There products are of outstanding quality, and PhoneDevil will work with you if you have any questions about them.The protector goes on the phone very easily.  Just read the instructions and take your time.",5
"I love this screen protector. It does everythiing it says its suppose to do!! The best thing is the reduction of fingerprints. I hate fingerprints on my phone and with this screen protector you can't see them, you can see a little oil from your fingers which washes away easily but no actual fingerprints!!! Plus it's an anti-glare too. I have tried several protectors and I have never found ones that work so great! I also realy like that it goes on so smoothly and there's no cutting or trimming, it fits perfectly, and the tags that you use to pull the cover apart with come right off with no stickiness or residue! I truly cannot say enough about this protector, its by far the best. I highly recommend it, you won't regret it!!!!!!",5
"I have always used Zagg products int eh past.  However, after getting one for my Iphone 4 and having the edges peel I decided it was time to look elsewhere.  This product received decent reviews so I went with them, and as a bonus I got 2 protectors!  The application is a pain in the tail (even with the online tutorial.  I put the first one on and it was horrifically covered in air and dust bubbles.  I don't know what had happened.  I was in the bathroom with the shower on and I had washed my hands etc.  I decided to use the second after re-cleaning the phone and waiting 5 minutes for steam.  Same result as the first.  The cover looked terrible, simply terrible.  It was so bad I immediately went and ordered another brand and paid next day shipping so I wouldn't have to use this product another moment.  I have applied many screen protectors, all with success, but not in this case.  I would not buy again and would not recommend.",1
"I bought this because I like the Matte / anti-glare feature.  It works great for that purpose.  I however, have recently come to not like the anti-glare feature as much as when you look at the screen it's not the true clarity of the screen.  It looks almost strange like there are multi-colored dots all over the screen when there is a white backdrop. I feel that it tends to hurt my eyes when I look at the screen sometimes with the multi-colored dots.  I know it's just a side effect of the anti glare but I don't like to live with the side effect any longer.  However , if you don't mind it the anti-glare feature works great and helps drastically when outdoors in the sun.  So it's all about personal preference.  The quality of the protector though is great!",4
"Normally I do not take time to do this, but this is an exceptional product. After persevering for a while I have perfected the installation of this. Go into your bathroom, turn on the shower on hot to get steam. Then ignore the instructions and pull off the top protective wrap first. Pull off the bottom cover and position it on the iPhone (which you already cleaned with a paper towel and a spritz of windex). Take some Scotch tape, fold one end of it 1/8 inch over and stick that tape on the top of the screen cover as a handle with some tape hanging out over the side of the phone. You put the little flap towards the center so when you are done you can pull the tape off the protector from the inside out. Now you can ust that tape as a handle and easily lift up the screen protector as many times as you like using another piece of tape to take out whatever dust there is from either the screen or the protector. Reposition the tape handle to get bubbles and dust out wherever you see them. I was able to get a perfect, (and I mean perfect) install of this by just being patient. Zero bubbles. Using it with an Incipio Ngp Case, which pops right on and does not lift this protector. The protector has almost no adhesive. Do not be put off by that, and you will see that its a huge plus as you can reposition until you get it right. This is an amazing product, I could not be happier. Here is the link for the Incipio case that works flawlessly with these protectors: [...]",5
"This screen protector comes with 2 in a package, as well as a cleaning cloth and a little card for application (to help avoid & smooth out air bubbles).  It was fairly easy to put on, had help with one and did one by myself.  I'm not sure how much it will protect the screen if the phone is dropped, but hopefully, I won't have to find out.  I will be ordering more!",5
I have always liked mediadevils products...This protector worked like I wanted and I had no issues with it...I would buy from them again,5
"It works. I like the matte finish to knock off the glare. Still leaves finger prints, but it's not as obvious as it would be without a protector. Pretty easy to apply. Just make sure the top is aligned to the front camera and receiver as perfectly as you can, because if it's off a little, it will only get worse as you get to the home button.",4
"the PhoneDevil matte screen protector does protect the screen, yet once again I am disappointed. the protector is seriously sub-par on durability. I have used so many different screen protectors on my iPhone 4S now I don't know where to turn. It's as is every Tom, Dick, and Harry are now producing screen protectors and none of them really know what they are up to.Pros - it does protectCons - after a VERY short time, the protector itself was very marred and scratched. I am not that bad to my phone, not sure what the deal is - I am very disappointed.UPDATE:- VERY shortly following my review, the founder of the company gave me a call and asked me about the difficulty I am having with the product. I have increased my review by one star simply due to the level of customer service and have agreed to give it another shot. I will update as soon as I receive and have a chance to try out once again.",3
"I just received these matte screen protectors yesterday and applied one to my iPhone 4S.  After seeing a friend of mine who had a Zagg branded matte protector and bragged about not having to wipe off fingerprints, I decided to try one out for myself.  I'm not a fan of Zagg products (had one on a Palm Pre years ago and it turned yellow on me) so I ordered the PhoneDevil version instead since it's the highest rated on Amazon.  After many years of owning smartphones I've become a pro at installing screen protectors, getting this one on with no bubbles was a cakewalk (clear scotch tape is your best friend).  All of the holes lined up well, the cuts seem very clean, no weird edges.As far as the look the matte protector goes there is definitely some 'pixellation-like' screen distortion as documented in the product description.  Not that it makes the screen unreadable, but it is more than noticeable if you are used to having a clear protector or none at all.  For me, this is not a bad thing as it is a tradeoff.  Fingerprints do not smudge up my screen anymore and glare from indoor lighting is no longer an issue.  After a few hours of using my iPhone with this protector on, I've gone from a middle-of-the-road reaction to loving it, and here's why : it makes the screen look and feel like electronic paper.  It has a very neat texture and the 'graininess' of the matte finish gives the screen a paper-like look.  This probably won't work for everybody, but I find it very enjoyable to use.Overall very happy and pleasantly surprised by this product.",5
"I have tried every type of screen protector for my iPhone and even went naked for a while because the ones I used in the past ended up peeling off or getting dust underneath AFTER a week.  I wanted that extra protection on my phone as well as something that would help with the glare on the screen when outside so I did some researching and I can to either the SGP or PhoneDevil.  Now I have used SGP before so I was taking a chance when I ordered this and I am greatly surprised!  This screen protector is perfect if you are looking for one that will reduce SOME glare and stop from messy fingerprints.  You will see the actually protector on the screen but that's a side effect of wanting one that will prevent glare and fingerprints.  If you want one that you will not see, I recommend looking at the crystal clear version.  This package comes with 2 screen protectors, a QUALITY microfiber cloth, an installation card, and instructions.  My recommendation is follow the direction in the video on PhoneDevils website and it will be much easy to install.  Came out perfect on my screen and I wish I had bought this one sooner!",5
"Very happy with the feel of it and it looks pretty good. I got the first, of two, screen protectors on with only a small air pocket on the bottom left corner. Overwise it looked good.But I thought I could do better so I ripped it off and tried the second protector. Unfortunately I ended up with another air pocket in the same place. Can't figure it out. Well the look and feel is great but I'm not sure if the tack is strong enough around the edge.Overall a very good product.",4
"Like all screen protectors, can be tricky to install.  Nevertheless, good quality and outstanding customer support.  They respond to email inquiries immediately and politely.",5
"Finally, a screen protector I can install without bubbles! The protector has a nice matte finish that doesn't pick up fingerprints or oil while adding a nice feel to your iPhone. I am very happy with this product. I would recommend you wipe your screen down with a clean hand towel or washcloth wetted with a small amount of rubbing alcohol; this seems to get you the cleanest possible surface. So, wipe down with alcohol and then polish with the included microfiber cloth, then smooth the protector on with the included card and presto, no bubbles. I am so pleased with this product that I ordered their iPad 2 screen protector as well. Highly recommend!",5
"Love it!  Bought another for other phones in the family. Watched the video to apply it to my phone and if you take your time no bubbles once applied. Do 'exactly' as they say to apply, son did it 'his way' and got bubbles. KIDS. Lol.",5
"I seriously don't know how people can't install these without bubbles and dust.  Installed at my desk that hasn't been dusted in months with my floor fan blowing, no dust, no bubbles.  I had to use the tape technique a bit, but their instructions were excellent (and the tape tip was priceless).  I installed 3 of these back-to-back today and had the same results with all three protectors.  Great product so far.... better than the protector I had on my old iPhone!",5
"It's anti-glare as it says and fits the iPhone 4s perfectly. It was simple to put on without any bubbles, they even give you a card to help smooth it out while putting it on and easy instructions. Worth it!",5
"I love the look and feel of this screen protector. It was just as easy to put on as any others, but I made sure to clean the screen with iKlear first and used scotch tape to pick up any extra dibris.The result was a bubble-less application. I replaced my husband's as well and he loves it too!",5
"These are the best screen protectors I have used, at an excellent price. They go on easily, last forever, and have excellent optical properties. I am currently using the matte version on my iPhone 4. It's still a little bit shiny, but does a very good job of reducing glare and minimizing greasy fingerprints. Love it.",5
"The manufacturer in a foreign country somehow got my email address from Amazon sent me an email that says I have to watch a movie to install this.I've installed dozens of screen protectors, and didn't have to watch a movie to install any of them.This is garbage.",1
"So I've had the SGP ultra oleophobic screen protector on my iPhone 4s for over a month. It was great at first but then over the last few weeks, the fingerprints got harder and harder to wipe off. When I first got it, fingerprints would wipe off pretty easily but I guess after time, you're also wiping the oleophobic coating off also. I loved the clarity but couldn't deal with the fingerprints anymore. So I read the reviews for the PhoneDevil Matte Clear sreen protector and decided to give it a shot. For the price, what could I lose.I got the package in 2 days - Amazon Prime :) and was a little nervous about all that I read about matte screens and how they ruin the great retina display. Installation was very easy. I've installed screen protectors many times so I think I have the hang of it. Using the tape trick to grab little dust particles is always helpful. After the install there were zero bubbles and it was a perfect fit. After about 1 week of use, I've gotten use to the matte coating. It does take some time but I actually like the look of it. It just looks clean. It does take away a little bit of the display brightness but it's hard to explain. I don't mind it at all. You can still see fingerprints but they aren't as obvious. For any of you that have a clear protector or don't have one at all know how the fingerprints can be pretty nasty. With the PhoneDevil matte protector, those fingerprints don't show up the same way. That's also a bit hard to explain. You should really just try it out especially if the fingerprints kill you everyday. But do keep in mind that the matte display will take some getting used to or you'll either love it or hate it. I for one used to hate it, but love it now since I don't see the fingerprints and also no more glare!! I loved it so much that I bought a matte protector for my iPad 2!! Looks great on that also!!",5
"Like other reviewers, I am experienced in installing screen protectors on 5 iphones and an ipad. I followed the video instructions to the letter. The first time, I had 4 dust bubbles almost immediately that couldn't be removed. 2nd protector went on smoothly with no bubbles, but 2 corners lifted right away and could not be coaxed into staying down. After reading others' similar experiences, I'm not settling, and received a return label from Amazon.",1
"some bubbling of course, but not too bad.  worked fine with my wife's phone with a speck case, but when I did mine and put the 4voi case back on it lifted the edge and ruined the cover.  But, I bought it for my wife's phone anyway, so I wasn't that disappointed that it didn't work on mine.",4
"I found this hard to install on the phone and it left a lot of bubbles and it seemed the more I tried to fix it, the more bubbles it developed.  I ended up paying about $15 for a single protector that advertised easy installation and no bubbles.  It was worth every penny since I ended up throwing these screen savers out.  They are just too much trouble to put on.  There were all kinds of tips from people on how to install them, including spraying soapy water on the phone before installing.  I didn't try that suggestion because I didn't want to spray soapy water on my phone.  Unless you have a lot of patience and don't care if the cover isn't perfect, spend more and get a better product.  The same applies to ipad screen covers.  These sucked for that as well and ended up in the trash.",2
"I love this screen protector, the is no reflection at all and it feels good to the tact. Unfortunately I bought a new phone and they don't fit.",5
This is the ONLY screen protector I was ever able to apply to my iPhone with nary a problem AND it looks fine and has lasted a month plus so far.,4
"good anti glare, feels great to slide your fingers on this, as opposed to the glass or glossy protectors. definitely smudge resistant. i havent used both yet, but the first one i put on my phone will not lay down completely flat at the edge of the home button, and has the same issue on one of the edges of the phone--where it matters most though, on the screen, there are no bubbles. i am a very experienced in applying screens like this, so i know it was not put on improperly; plus, the raising is in unorthodox locations, where youd expect it to be very easy to push air out. the rest is flawless however. hopefully the other one doesnt have the same issue.",4
"Accurate product description, not just hype. I use my phone outside all the time and also as a dashboard mounted GPS. Shiny surfaces and fingerprint smudges just won't do. I've owned several brands of matte iPhone and iPad screen protectors, including a Zagg which developed a plaid texture. Matte tends to dull things down a bit; MediaDevil by far gives the sharpest, brightest image. Be patient putting it on.",5
"Compared to a couple other brands of anti-glare screen protector, this is definitely more clear.But you still notice it's there and make things a bit darker a bit more fuzzy.",3
Hard to put on.  I don't like them.  I can't seem to put it on.  Finally quit and din't ever attempt again.,2
"I don't care much for screen protectors, to be honest.  I prefer my iPhone without them but I apply the matte variety because I use my iPhone in the Magellan car cradle for GPS purposes and I hate the glare coming off the screen.  It's also really nice to not have to deal with cleaning off the screen constantly because of all the fingerprints that are left behind.  I don't like gross, smudgy screens!  I've tried the cheapies that run you a few bucks and come in packs, and all I can say is - you get what you pay for.  I agree with the excellent reviews out here for this product -- it goes on super easy, minimal air bubbles that can be quickly and efficiently squeezed out using the tools they give you, and it applies very smoothly on the screen.  I'm so used to fighting screen protector application and having to go through a few before I get it right, and I had this one on my iPhone in a matter of minutes - first shot - and was very pleased with the outcome!  Definitely a buy if you're looking for a good matte screen protector.",5
"So I have now used both of these and had same issue.  First, the adhesive is very minimal, you really get one chance and even then its not very sticky.  Dont even think of removing and replacing it at all.  Second the cut of the cover wasn't accurate on both samples.  I had to trim the second when I realized the first would just keep peeling and even then its marginal.  Granted its not too bad as far as altering the clarity of the screen, Zagg is worse but consider this a temporary protection at best since the fraying will annoy you eventually and you will pull it off.",2
"Had some problems with bubbles, but that was my fault. The protector itself is pretty great. Just know what you're getting yourself into with anti-glare.",4
"My family has a number of iPhones.  Mostly 3gs's and a couple of 4s's.I've tried a number of screen protectors - Even the highly rated Zagg.Phone Devil - Be advised that there IS a learning curve to putting these guys on.  Getting them on strait and bubble-free DOES take a little learning.That said - Phone Devil is BY FAR the #1 screen protector.  I have installed about 10 of them, the last 5 or so PERFECTLY.  I won't buy anything else.The major 'trick' to getting these guys on bubble-free is to make sure your device is VERY CLEAN when you apply it.  I recommend a specialized cleaner - I use 'iKlear' myself.  Then, it's a matter of putting the top on VERY CAREFULLY to get it aligned perfectly.  Then gently pull the bottom sheet off as you use the card to bring it down to the bottom.  Don't worry about a few bubbles.  This is NORMAL, UNLESS the bubbles have a speck in them.  That would be dust and you have to start over as you will NEVER get that bubble out.  Again, I stress - CLEAN screen upon application and CLEAN HANDS - Do NOT touch the sticky side of the Phone Devil.  Also, work in a dust free environment as much as possible.The little bubbles left at this point can be removed with the card.  BE PATIENT - this step takes a LOT of work pulling the strait-edge over the bubble to slowly get it out the side of the screen.After that - LET THE DEVICE SIT for a couple of hours before you put on any other protective case.  This allows the sticky side to 'set' - Also, super small bubbles may disappear on their own after a couple of days.Once again I say - Once you get the 'knack' of putting these on - Phone Devil is THE #1 screen protector to buy.  That's MY opinion.- Ron Donofero*Edit*  We're now on almost ALL 4s iPhones.  I just installed Phone Devil on my Daughter and Wife's iPhones.  I have a few more on order to install for friends.  NOTE - Installing these things perfectly takes PATIENCE - and you may need to use more than one per phone if you make a mistake (usually that means the work environment isn't sufficiently clean!).  That said, this is the BEST screen protector on the market.  I re-iterate on my installation suggestions:1.  CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN - Make sure the iPhone glass is SUPER clean.  I use iKlear myself.  Be sure to spray some on your fingers as well.  Clean the iPhone screen using iKlear sprayed onto a micro-fiber cloth - rub the cloth thoroughly over the iphone.2.  Wait about 5 minutes for the iKlear to evaporate off the surface.  Use the DRY micro-fiber cloth that came with Phone Devil to clean off the screen.3.  Install the protector using the method I describe in my original post.  Alignment is CRUCIAL - try not to touch the glue-side with your fingers, but get that baby on STRAIGHT - the oval speaker and Camera hole at the top are good for aligning purposes.4.  PATIENCE - PERSISTENCE - Persistently use the card to remove bubbles.  Mainly from the edge.  Do this while the adhesive dries for at least an hour (unless you have a bubble free install - most unlikely).5.  WAIT WAIT WAIT - Your screen looks GREAT at this point.  But if you put external phone protectors on now, you risk the edges pulling up and creating bubbles.  Give the protector at least an hour to 'cure' - THEN put on your other impact protection.  More than an hour would be much better.I'm being very specific, which may SCARE some people - Do NOT be afraid.  It's easier than it may sound.  A bit of patience and persistence WILL pay off.  These are the BEST screen protectors on the market - and despite my lengthy instructions, are probably the easiest to install.- Ron Donofero",5
"I used these for my 3GS. My daughter recently got a 4S, so I bought them for her - she loves them. Easy to apply, and make it easier to see the screen when in bright sunshine.",5
"I had used my iPhone for a few weeks without a screen protector before getting these. I was utterly amazed by the difference. The glare on the screen was dramatically reduced, as well as the appearance of smudgy fingerprints. Before I had to wipe my screen constantly; now I only do it a couple times a week.I've been using these for over 6 months now, and I'm on the second one. They start to look a little scratched up after a while. I also play a lot of Scramble with Friends on my phone, and you can tell that the screen protector is much more worn in the little grid where my finger moves around for the game. So I'll probably be buying new ones soon.",5
I purchased this item due to the good reviews. I was very happy with this items good quality material and its glare free technology. I have gone through a couple of other brand's screen protectors; this one is by far the best.A MUST BUY for all you Iphone users looking for the best screen protector on the market.,5
"This product really suprised me, but in a GREAT way.I was a bit skeptical about purchasing the screen protector because it is a little more expensive than what i was expecting to purchase. In fact I made the right choice. The discription is true and the customer service is excellent. Media Devil really wants to give quality customer service.The video link in the e-mail from media devil once purchased shows how to apply. I got it right on the first try. WORTH every penny.Enjoy!",5
This is a total waste of money.  The text is distorted when you try to read something. It did not stick 100% to the screen.,1
"Worked great, no issues in applying and it worked just as described. I would recommend it to others. It's a good product.",4
"I have tried several screen protectors, and this is one of the first that I feel is worth the higher price.  It is very easy to apply.  I have used 2 of them so far, and I have not had any air bubbles appear on the screen.  One of them had a very small portion of a corner that was not sticking perfectly, but my case overlaps the edges and held it down there, anyway.  I highly recommend this screen protector, and I will buy it again when I need to change my current one.",5
"I tried a good number of screen protectors and all of them left something to be desired and some were outright awful. I decided to give this MediaDevil a try based on mostly positive reviews. I knew that even the best protectors aren't going to be easy to apply and that if you mess up once, the protector is trashed and unusable, which has happened to me with some other brand protectors.It really is a bit tricky to apply the protector very accurately. One has to be patient and apply it with great precision to make it worthwhile and that's always the problem with products such as these. That being said, I gave this one a go and I'm very, very happy with the results. I was able to apply the MagicScreen aligned perfectly at the first go on my new white iPhone 4S without any air bubbles or dust getting underneath.I can honestly say that this is the first screen protector I've tried that looks and feels better than without the protector at all. The screen is just as clear but without the glare and is just as responsive to the touch and actually feels smoother than the naked screen. I've used the protector for two weeks now and there is nary a smudge on it when before without the protector I've had to wipe the screen at least a few times per day to remove the smudges which, as another reviewer pointed out, is rather disgusting to look at.I highly recommend this product to anyone who has an iPhone 4/4S. After trying this out for a few weeks I decided to order more for my wife's iPhone 4S as well and have been heartily recommending it to other friends who recently got the 4S. I really can't ask for more from a screen protector. One just has to be very attentive and careful when applying it. But once you have it on there properly you'll totally forget it exists and not have to worry about fingerprints, smudges and scratches again.",5
"Let me start by saying that I'm lucking they include 2 screen protectors with this order because I royally botched the first one. If you've never installed a screen protector before, it's like performing open hear surgery when you're not a doctor. With that said, once I installed the second protector, it's looks and works great.  The anti glare and anti fingerprint attribute is the best.  This is much better than the less expensive, cheap screen protectors.",5
Love the way this covers the phone.  Good economical purchase for the kids' phones - a layer of protection for their carlessness (have one for my phone too for my carlessness).  Easy to apply and seems to do the trick!,5
This is the best screen cover on the market. Very easy to put on. No bubbles. Just make sure you buy it from PhoneDebil and not from Abe-123 .,5
I and say enough good about this screen protector.  Does not show greasy fingerprints and handprints as bad as the other Brands.  Has a feel similar to bare with no screen protector.,5
"This is one of the better screen protectors on the market.People shouldn't rate screen protectors down because of dust or bubbles, they do take a bit of finesse to get on perfectly.Anyways, these protectors are pretty durable and seem to be fairly scratch resistant.I had gone through a bunch of cheaper screen protectors that eventually got scratched and peeled off, but this one has lasted me for quite a while now.Some application tips:Use scotch tape to remove dust and hair from the screen or the protector. Simply tapping the dust with the tape should be enough to remove it. Do this to avoid fingerprints.Align two edges at once while holding up the end with a piece of scotch tape as to avoid getting fingerprints on the other edge. Flatten once you've aligned two edges with a card or your finger while keeping the other end aligned by holding the piece of tape.",5
"Great product and great service. Wish i had bought the iPad protector from MediaDevil too, as it was so easy to apply for my iPhone.",4
"I have used many screen protectors for my iphone 4 and iPhone 4s, such as the crystal clear and matte ones by power support, and several other cheaper generic brands. This screen protector is by far the best I've used and is worth the few extra dollars. The rainbow effect some people mentioned is only noticeable in direct light at a certain angle. However, EVERY screen protector has this, and is much more noticeable in other brands compared to MediaDevil's. As for the issues people mentioned with applying it, I had none. It just takes a little time to get it to go on clean without any bubbles, as it does with any screen protector you apply. Mine went on first try perfectly and with no bubbles.  Overall, it is perfectly clear, easy to clean, and feels like your using the glass screen. Great product and recommend others to give it a try.",5
Simply go the MediaDevil site or YouTube and watch the tutorial and your install with be perfect.  I'm disappointed that you only receive two per pack when they use to provide three.,4
"It looks good on, but application is a PITA.  The video you can watch on their site mentions 'using the adhesive tape method' which they wanted to show, but didnt get lint trapped during install.  They tell you to go to mediadevil.com/apply-magic-screen to view the video where they do.  Don't bother, it's not there.I have used Zagg, and this.  Stick with Zagg, if you do run into a problem with the Zagg, it is easier to work with.I attempted to use the 'adhesive tape method' they so *strongly* recommend, but unable to find an example of.  I used the tape to 'pick up' the partially applied protector, awesome, now its stuck to the the tape, and when attempting to get those apart, the second part of the protector started to come off. So I'm trying to hold one portion down with one hand, and unstick the other, and finally gave up, tore it off and started over with the second one.  It went on a little easier.I need to replace mine, which I was going to do with the second one, but will just stick with Zagg.If you are going to do two phones, make sure to have at least 4 of these things ready.",2
I've been using the screen protector for a few months now. Not only it stays well in place but is also scratch resistant and doesn't affect the image quality.Be patient and extra careful when applying the protector to your iPhone screen.,5
I have not had this product long.  But have had several different versions of others.  So far this one stays on really well.  The others stretched when you put them on and would tend to peel up.  These are a thicker plastic that if put on correctly seems to stay in place and not peel up on the edges or tear around the iPhone home button at the bottom.  Really easy to put on.  Easiest so far that I have tried.Only down side is that it smudges pretty easy.  Very similar to no screen protector being on the iPhone.But since Phone spends lots of time in my pocket I want to protect the screen from my keys constantly hitting the screen.  This seems to be a great option.,4
"I've tried other protectors and this is one of the best. Got it on with no bubbles first try!I regret getting the clear though...it has a bad reflection issue and smears/smudges just like the unprotected screen. If this bothers you, then I suggest the matte protector (I will be getting some next).",5
I've had a lot of screen protectors and this one is great - it still retains the high resolution screen and protects it as well.,5
"this product is awesome. it does what it says and it is super thin. i don't think it's fair to blame the product for the difficulty of installing the screen.the awesome part  about this purchase is that i got an email from the company thanking me for the purchase. then they included a link for a YouTube video of the installation process. that's very cool and i thank them for that.i did not use water, but cleaned it with the cloth. i don't think they can make the process any less painful and more frustrating, to be honest. you just have to be careful and take your time. i placed the phone on a rubber cabinet shelf liner mat that did not allow the phone to move. took my time and put the first edge in and started scraping with the card they provided.got all the bubbles out and was super happy. then i pulled tab 2, but because i was in a hurry to enjoy it, i did not realize i had ACTUALLY PULLED the screen protector too. oops. and i had even told my wife, 'look....it's looks like it's not even there'... lolso, i started again. placed the second screen protector and the corners did not align. so, i lifted it WITH SCOTCH TAPE and replaced it.so, it takes time and definitively patience. and use scotch tape, please....it looks beautiful and yes, it is on there the second time around. lol",5
"I've used PhoneDevil protectors on iPod Touch, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, and now an iPhone 4. Each application resulted in a flawless outcome.",5
"I have ordered both the matte and crystal clear versions of this screen protector for the iPhone 4, and both are truly phenomenal products. MediaDevil's CEO will contact you directly via email with a video and instructions which are very helpful. For all my future screen protection needs, I will only use MediaDevil, and after this purchase, you will, too.",5
"We've used Zagg screen protectors in the past, but found the matte look and feel to be less desirable.  With this screen protector, we can hardly tell that its applied, leaving the iPhone looking and feeling more like its natural state.  4 stars instead of 5, simply because it was a bit difficult to get on correctly - after trying again and again, finally got it lined up right.  I'd buy this again, no complaints once installed.",4
"I have used several brands of screen protectors in the past. ThePhoneDevil Magicscreen: Crystal Clear edition is by far the best at a most reasonable price. It is very simple to install, and if not centered correctly, you can simply lift the screen protector off with a good adhesive tape and recenter/install. So far, it truly is crystal clear and created somewhat of a naked feel to the phone screen. The design is cut so that it fits perfectly to the screen. I would highly recommend this product to anyone searching for that perfect screen protector that offers easy installation with virtually no bubbles. Thank you for a fine product.",5
"I rarely review products, but I thought I'd throw in my $0.02 on this product.I've installed many screen protectors, and while I'm no pro, it's not rocket science.  Compared to the Zagg, installation is more difficult, and less forgiving, since any tiny speck of dust is going to be visible.After application, the product does give the phone a slick matte finish, but that's about it.Aside from all of that, direct-sunlight exposure makes the screen completely unreadable compared to no cover, or compared to the Zagg screen (which is glossy).  More importantly, this thing scratches up very quickly.  I have a tungsten wedding band, and this thing just didn't stand a chance in my pocket with that thing.  On top of all of that, the Retina Display definitely loses resolution (visible as pixelated rainbows).I've since bought a Zagg (and mind you, I'm no shill for the company), and the difference is huge.Overall, I'd assume this is what most covers are like, and I'm thoroughly unimpressed.",2
I absolutely love this screen protector! I can't even see it on my iPhone! I am really happy with this purchase. I was able to do mine perfect on the first try. Just follow the instructions and it should do well. It's been a good week or so since I've had this and it is still absolutely perfect :-),5
"So i bought these protectors, and installed them. Along the left edge it appeared the protector did not stick and this upset me. I have since found out that these protectors are cut very precisely and must be put on exactly.The screen looks like there is no protector on it, it is very crisp and clear.Also if you have any issues, there customer service is very helpful.update  *** January 17, 2011 ****After selling my iPhone to my sister-in-law, I have purchased the iPhone 4s. These covers which were on my phone for a year and a half with no flaws or issues were sure to be on my new iPhone.This time i got the placement perfect and this protector went on and disappeared.this is a great product, but take care in installing them or you will be frustrated. They are cut so precise.The instructions are very easy to understand.",5
"I have tried just about every screen protector there is for my iPhone 4, and have hated them all.  I used this brand for my iPhone 3G, so when I saw that they made one for the iPhone 4 I ordered it.  FINALLY ONE THAT WORKS!  No bubbles, good quality screen.  This is the only one that I recommend.",5
I'm very happy with this screen protector because I really can't tell if it's on my screen or not. It's so clear and nice. Highly recommended.,5
"PROS: Product is accurately described and comes with complete, detailed, and clear installation instructions. Protects my iPhone 4S screen perfectly well without affecting its sensitivity or clarity. I followed the printed instructions carefully and watched the installation videos closely and got a good all-around fit, including a tight fit around all edges without scratching the protector itself. Shortly after placing my order the folks at MediaDevil emailed me to ensure all was OK and to point out some additional installation resources - very nice touch!CONS: No matter how clean my phone and environment were and how closely I followed instructions, I couldn't avoid trapping a few tiny dust bubbles underneath the protector. But that has nothing to do with the product itself and is not a deal breaker for me.FINAL WORD: Product is on the pricey side but given the protection it gives the screen, it's well worth it. To install successfully you must follow ALL instructions closely. I wish there was something like a practice screen included in addition to the 2 that come with the packet.",4
"This screen protector was applied to my iPhone 4 easily by my son, who has a steadier hand than I do, as well as precise attention to detail.  He managed to get it done without any dust, and we found the online video application instructions helpful.  Once applied it is not visible--I cannot tell there is anything on my screen, and the touchscreen is super sensitive.I never realized how much my OtterBox Defender's screen had diminished sensitivity until removing that screen when it got cloudy and scratched to replace it with the MediaDevil Crystal Clear screen protector.  (The screen part of the Defender is pretty easy to simply peel off.)  ****Now when I talk on the phone I have to carefully hold it away from my cheek--my cheek kept hitting things on my phone, particularly the mute button!****I haven't tried any other screen protectors, but this one has worked out great, and I'm very happy with it.****Update! My son noticed the screen was not going off when I lifted the phone to my ear--we thought the sensor wasn't working, but I found out it is because the screen protector somehow disables this sensor. With a tiny curved scissor I cut the plastic that was covering the sensor, and voila! now it works like it's supposed to.  No more hitting buttons with my cheek, which is always nice!",5
"This screen was tricky to install at first, it was prone to bubbling no matter how careful I was. After about a 20 minute install I finally got it on top of my iphone bubble free, and the screen protector is doing its job very well.EDIT--I am not sure of the life of these screen protectors, but after about six months, the bottom left of the protector keeps bubbling up. This will probably be the last time I buy an 'expensive' screen protector as I can get 18 of the cheap protectors for the same price of the PhoneDevil.",2
"The MediaDevil Screen protectors are a very high quality product and fit Perfectly on my new iPhone 4S.  People that have mixed reviews normally do not follow the directions for installing the protector or watch the video from the MediaDevil website.  If you are careful, take your time, do it in a area with minimal airflow and not in a dusty environment they come out prefectly.  recommend you do this in your bathroom after running the shower a few minutes to steam the room and settle dust. The product is only as good ad the person taking the time to install correctly.  These really are one of the best protectors on the market.",5
"IT fits together snugly and tightly.  But it is a little tricky to take the phone out if you need to remove the battery or SIM or SD card.  It feels good and gives a tight, non-slip grip.",5
"This is a great case.  It looks good, snaps on well, stays on well and is very durable.It makes it just a *little* tough to touch the edges of the screen, but it's no big deal.  I take it off occasionally to clear the crud that gets captured in the crevices.",5
"looked nice at first ,but when time came to clean phone this was hard to come off with out breaking after two or three times opening it the lil prongs snaped ,i only had for short time,,waste of money again",2
"The case is a good/snug fit and looks nice. However, the thickness and proximity of the bottom edge of the case to the four controls buttons at the bottom of the screen makes the process of using these buttons rather frustrating. The problem is repeated when edit/control bottoms are rendered close to the bottom of the screen. Also, the proximity of the top flange of the case to the area of the notification bar which is at the top of the screen creates the same problem of not being able to manipulate the bar easily.THIS CASE NEEDS A RE-DESIGN TO ENSURE THE FUNCTIONALITY ADDS TO THE CURRENT NICE LOOK/FEEL OF THE CASE.My experience is in line with an earlier comment. Nice fit and feel to the case but poor design at the top and bottom of the case as these parts of the case interfere with the functionality of the touch screen.You may buy the case for its looks but controlling your device (when using the touch buttons at the bottom of the screen or notification bar on top of the screen) may be very frustrating! If you suffer from hypertension, avoid this!",1
Solid case for a solid phone. Works well and as it's designed for. Glad I got this because the phone would've been beat up in no time.,5
"The case fits snuggly over my Captivate, and it has a good look and feel.  The only complaint I have is that the opening for the stereo plug isn't wide enough to accommodate most standard stereo cables.  The cables will fit well enough to play uninterupted audio if the phone is left still, but you may want to consider another case if you plan to connect headphones and use them on-the-go.",4
"I tried various cases on several different cell phones. I currently have the Samsung Galaxy S. I tried a rubber like feeling case first. The problem was, as with many cases, that it collected lint from my pocket that was impossible to remove. Other cases were too slippery which made it difficult to keep hold of. Still others were too hard. And some that were rubber feeling wouldn't slip in an out of my pocket easily. Then others simply didn't appear to give much protection.Then I tried this Amzer Luxe Agyle Skin Case and I love it.The pluses are:1. Nice looking.2. Feels good in the hand because of the jell-like material.3. Grips easily and therefore feels more secure in the hand.4. Slides out of the pocket easily.5. Does not collect pocket lint.6. Slightly flexible and would seem to protect the phone if dropped.I highly recommend this case.",5
It is decent.easy to remove.seems like it protects the 'outer shell' of your captivate.Although I think if I dropped the phone there is still the possibility of the thing breaking.the good thing about this is that it doesnt block the controls at the bottom of the screen.,4
"This case is made of TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) material, which makes for a more rigid, better-fitting case. It looks great on the phone and doesn't make the phone look bulky at all. Best of all, the smooth texture prevents the phone from getting caught in your pocket and doesn't attract lint as do the silicon cases. The argyle design looks great too. I highly recommend this case.",5
"I looked at many different cases online before I decided on this one. I am very pleased with it. The smoke color blends in nicely with the Captivate. They argyle pattern is much less apparent than it is in the picture. The fit is great. Overall, I am pleased. I would definitely recommend this.",5
"This cover is made of a soft gel like material that feels very soft and grippy to the touch. It also has a nice shine to it making your phone look shiny new. It fits so nicely that it sometimes looks like I'm not using a case on my phone at all. I previously had the body gove case and though that case was nice too, this one has a much better fit and it's grippier. Other covers I've used are so bulky, they made my phone look 'Fat' - this one makes it look sleek land sexy. The best feature about this cover is that the volume and power rockers are covered and protected by the case. They are not exposed to dust or other elements so gunk doesn't get in there. Love it!",5
"The picture shown makes the argyle pattern stand out more than it actually does. The pattern is visible, and very nice, but also extremely subtle and stands out only in direct sunlight or if the light hits it just right. The Galaxy S logo on the back shows through very nicely because the case is technically clear, though with a smoke opaque tint (except on the very top and bottom, and along the edge framing the front, where it is a more solid opaque color with no pattern). Overall, it's a very nice look (very simple--  not too gaudy).The case fits absolutely perfect. The phone doesn't slip or move in it, and it doesn't add much bulk (maybe just enough to make it feel not quite so thin and fragile).The case is a semi-hard (but pliable, obviously) and smooth plastic that feels incredibly durable. Unlike the typical silicone skins, it doesn't attract lint or dust, though it's smooth enough to attract more than a couple fingerprints. It slides in and out of my pocket easily.I love that the side buttons are completely covered. The case is molded so that you feel the slightly raised power and volume buttons on either side. When you touch them, they just push down perfectly on the buttons under the skin. The ports along the top (usb, headset/mic), the speaker, the camera lens, and the mic on the bottom are all uncovered.It hasn't caused an heat issues and it's not that difficult to pull off and put back on, but it's not that easy, either (which I consider a good thing). This is the best value on the market for this phone. You can pay alot more for a similar case by another manufacturer sold in stores with this phone, but it's not nearly as nice as this one for less than half the price. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.",5
This product is as described and easy to use and recommend it everyone. Works great and I will buy more in the future.,5
bad cable. works for charging but not for data transfer.,1
I have used this probably dozen times to download wallpapers for my LG cell phone and it works as promised,4
"I keep this in my car to charge my phone when I'm driving.  I works just like the original for me.  No problems in over 2 years now,",5
I bought the first cable a few months ago and have never had a problem. So when another family member upgraded their phone to a new LG I purchased this cable for them and again it works flawlessly. I actually got the cable and a 16 gig memory card off amazon for half of what the cell phone provider wanted for just the cable. Very pleased.,5
"Gr8 alternative for a cheap price, bought this for my Galaxy S3 and I'm using it in my car and at work in addition to the one I received with the phone.",5
This cable makes it very easy to charge your phone or transfer files.  It's great when there are no wall plugs close by.  It was worth every penny and more !,5
This is a Great Deal & a lot cheaper than what wally world is charging for the Tracfone USB cables,5
Just what I needed to connect my cell phone to my computer. Ordered another as a spare. A good product and seemingly of very good construction.,5
This seems to be a nice product for my phone. I was surprised how fast it came. A great job on the sellers part.,5
It was what I was looking for. I like it because it will work.  Recommend for anyone who has a Lg 840G.,5
What can you say about something as simple as a cable?The Micro USB Data Cable for all LG Micro USB Phones - Black works as advertised and is a robust product,5
"It works, what more can I say.  I bought this cable to use with my Sprint LG Optimus G Smart Phone.  It does what it is supposed to do, just as advertised and at a very reasonable price.  A similar cable purchased from the Sprint Store would cost a great deal more, 'nuff' said.",5
Bought this for an LG 840G Trac Fone. It connects easily and was reasonable in price.  Transfer rate is fairly good.,4
Better than expected  pretty thick wire. I've seen thinner before. I' ve been using it for a while and I had no trouble. I have uploaded a picture so you can see how it really looks.,4
Got this cable so I could load cd's from my computer to my phone (Tracfone Lg 800g) and Pics from my phone to my computer. Fit into my phone with no problems and into my computer also with no problems at all. Did everything I wanted it to do. A must have if you want a back up of your pics on your phone and to use the Ipod feature on your phone. Great product at a great price.,5
Does what it is supposed to do and was shipped quickly. This cable allows access to the micro SD card in the phone with out taking the phone apart to get the Micro SD card removed.,5
"I bought this for data transfer to my computer from my LG 840g Tracfone. I mostly use it for managing photos. I found that it also works for transferring files with my Kindle. Also works as a charging cable for both my phone, the Kindle, my Bluetooth headset, from both computer USB port and two different USB chargers (one is from Apple)I prefer the shorter 3' length, even when traveling, but especially when connected to my computers. Just less clutter.",4
This works perfectly with my LG500G. It is a sturdy product. You just plug it into your LG500G then into your computer and voila your LG500G appears as a drive so you can transfer files.,5
"Bought this to transfer my pics and videos str8 from my LG840g tracfone too my desktop PC, works perfect everytime",5
"I bought this so I could read the flash memory in my cell phone from my desktop computer, but apparently one needs a PC or perhaps a Mac; my desktop simply tells me 'No driver found.' Another cable for my junk cable box.",5
"This works fine, allowing me to transfer music (that I've converted to the right format) from my PC to my Phone.  And this, in turn, save me money (not having to buy music from the cell phone company) and ensures that I get to listen to the music that I like (I have a moody music taste, everything from old punk, some alternative, to hard-core rock.... depending on my mood).  So this works great for me and allows me to carry my favorite music on my phone (I have to convert music from the cd format to the phone's format (WMA or MP3).",4
"This is a product that is needed for your cellphones. I have 2 sets, one for the home and one for the car, in case I am traveling, and have a need for my cable. It is a needed accessory for your cellphones. I do not know what I would do without it, to keep my cellphones charged. I am pleased with this product and happy with it. Used it several times already and thankful for this. :)",5
"If your computer has bluetooth feature there is really no need  for this,unless you plan to transfer big amounts of data and time is an issue for you.It also gives you option to charge your phone directly from computer or, probably,anything else with USB port.",4
"it arrived super fast and hooks up to your phone and computer fine. all i use it for is to take pictures off my phone and put them on my computer. for the price, i consider it a great investment!",5
I ordered two usb chargers because I am tired and exhausted from buying cheap ones at the stores that break. I'm always stuck trying to tape them back together. Very annoying!!!The price was right on these and these looked sturdy.They came in the mail fast and were wrapped in their own packaging. I'm happy so far!!,5
Exactly what I needed at a great price. Beats paying a high price at the electronic store. Would buy again.,5
Been using several of these for two years (gave some away); no problems whatsoever.Completely happy and amazed they're only $3. Cell phone stores are crooks ;),5
"This product was a great buy, it's durable and strong!!I recommend it to anyone who wants one! It's the rite length.",4
Price and shipping were great. i brought this for my LG 800 phone. It makes uploading and downloading stuff from my phone to computer easy.,5
I purchased this product to download pictures from my phone to my computer.  I discovered it also works to charge my phone from my computer when I am at work.  So double duty.  I'm happy.,4
The wire is perfect and shipping was fast!! The cable did everything its suppose to do and i use it when i travel without any issues.,5
works perfect... bought it because I use prepaid phone service... so now I can transfer files and charge phone with no problems ...,5
"I have purchased other data transfer cables and been ripped off, but this one does what is says. It is an actual data transfer cable and works perfectly for my LG tracfone.",5
"There is not much you can say about a cable, the connections are a good quality and it is not flimsy.  Good quality cable for everyday use of my Kindle, phone, and bluetooth headset.",5
"OEM quality, 90% discount. What else could one ask for? There isn't much else I can say about a cable so have a nice day. - RJZ",5
"Purchased as an alternative to always having to remove & replace battery, memory card, and cover every time I wanted to add files to phone. Sadly, does not transmit data to/ from said TracFone. Unknown if it works on ANY phone. Thankfully the price and shipping was low or I would return. So I will keep this inexpensive cord as yet another charging option.",1
Does the job and shipped quickly!  Works well the the LG 840G Tracfone.  There is not much else that I can share than has not already been shared in previous reviews.,5
"The cable worked, and was a nice addition to my LG phone. If you buy these cables at a cell phone store, they can be very expensive. The only reason I needed the cable was in case I ever need to charge my cell phone battery, and I don't have my phone charger with me. You can plug the USB end of the cable into your PC or laptop USB port and charge the phone battery.",5
"Turns out I already ordered one, so now I have two.  Nothing against it, just I didn't really need it.  Thanks.",4
"I got this data cable for my new LG 800, of course it works and I loaded up on accessories for my new phone. So far I have loved my LG products.",5
I recently purchased this cable. It works great moving data between my LG800g phone with micro SD card and my computer. I am very happy to have purchased this cable.,5
It's a USB adaptor for my phone to the PC.  All you need to worry about is if you bought the right adaptor and cable length for your product.  This one is for the LG800 phone.,4
Works as described. Data cable here is necessary to transfer files from the pc to phone and vice versa on the lg phone.,5
"I was gifted with an LG800G Tracfone that needed a data cable. I purchased this one, even though I was skeptical of the quality. I needn't have worried. This cable works just like its higher priced twin and transfers data as quickly as is required.Since I am also using the LG800G as an mp3 player, I used the data cable to move music from my computer to my phone. Worked like a charm. It's everything I wanted and more, and all for a tiny price.Five stars for this one.",5
"What is not to like? My desktop sees the phone when attached, and the cable works like it's supposed to.",5
this cord was a waste it not like a regular data usb it does absolutely nothing. read the fine print it may save yo a headache,1
"The cable I received looks different than the LG cable which came with my LG phone so I cannot attest to whether it is OEM or a generic.  It does work.Edit-wife called and said her phone was discharging while using the cable on a trip to Paris. Sure enough, cable was no longer working so she got two weeks out of it.",2
"Perfect...these cables work perfectly, unlike many aftermarket cables which claim to be 'for LG' but which trigger a warning message about cable suitability for use with the phone every time it is plugged in!",5
"I bought this because it was cheap, so my expectations was not the highest. After receiving it, I was happy, the fit 'looks' good. Makes the Droid X a bit thicker. The phone sits on the car's dash and arm rest without falling.The downside is the rubber is a bit soft/flimsy, it moves around but doesn't come off the phone. The sticky rubber makes it hard to remove from my pocket as well (great for the car, bad for my pocket).If you don't mind a slightly thicker phone and want to save money on a case, give this a try. Its cheap!",4
The Silicone Black Rubber Soft Cover Case fits like a glove. It so easy to put on. Unlike those snap on cases. It provides that bounce protection in case it accidently falls. It protects the phone well. I like the flexibility of slipping it on and off. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes versatility and convenience.,5
"Okay, first off:  it's very good.  I like it a lot and have been using it since I received it.  However, it's just a *speck* too big on all four sides, so, if I use the edge of the screen (top and sides) or the buttons, I have to 'push' it out of the way a little.  No biggie for me, but I'm sure there are those who will be driven mad by this.",4
"I read the reviews on this cover and ordered one.  Now that I have it, you just can't beat the price.  The holes are in the right places, to include the microphone holes.  The only thing wrong with it is the rubber is in the way to press the buttons on the bottom of the Droid X.  You can push the buttons, but it isn't easy.  You have to push them with your fingernail because the rubber gets into the way.  The modification is to cut the rubber near the buttons an eighth of an inch or so.  There is a place in the rubber on the bottom that indents near the microphone.  Just trim the rubber all the way across just under the microphone indention.  That way the rubber is not in the way to push the lower buttons and it looks and functions well.",5
"Performs as expected, for the price I figured I couldn't go wrong.  Looks like I didn't throw away $3.",5
bought this for my daughter and she loved it cause she is a phone dropper but with this the phone comes out safe,5
"The case looks gray, so I was a bit concerned, since I didn't want it to be too light.  However, it turns out it's more of a smoky brown/gray which ultimately appears dark gray/almost black once it's on the phone.  It's tight enough to stay on without issue, and flexible enough to take off within 5 seconds for a quick battery pull.  I've dropped the phone a few times with the case on and haven't had any damage to the phone or scuffs to the case.  This is definitely a keeper, and easy to recommend.",5
"Got this thing for $3. Cannot beat that!  It has a rubbery feel, so it's not one of those cheap snap-on cases that you see everywhere.  Doesn't add bulk, and feels good in my hand.Only thing to note is that, as others have said, the design is pretty much invisible.  You're basically getting a black case.  As long as that isn't a hangup for you, you'll love this case.",5
Arrived on time but not as depicted in picture SLIGHTLY different but the fit is awesome. Please update picture to what you are selling. Overall satisfied though. 4 stars for wrong display pic.,4
I am very happy with this skin! The Argile doesn't show up very well...but that was great for me. It is a made skin that fits the Droid X perfect!! It is a snug fit that wraps around the top edge and snaps into place. It is also very eaisy to remove. Couldn't be happier!!,5
"Love this case! Fits the Droid X perfectly, leaves room at the bottom of the phone to be able to push the hard keys without interference. The top power buttons and side volume and camera buttons are a little hard to push at first, but I found that they loosened up a bit after use. My only knock would be the color/design of the case. On the phone, it merely looks like a shiny black case, very hard to see the argyle design as it is on the inside and not outside. Not a deal-breaker, but definitely not as pronounced as it appears to be in the picture. Overall a great case, just wish the design was a bit more visible.",4
"this case is great looking, protects very well from scratches, and isn't too big and bulky like a lot of them. its actually more of a skin which is what i was looking for.if i had to change anything about it, id add a little protection to the front bottom, before the microphone of course. id also add a little protection near the back speaker. still protects from most drops though. thing is great.",5
"I purchased this along withQmadix Gel for Motorola MB810 DROID X Flex - Black. I bought this to use and experiment with crystals and making designs on the case. I figured it was cheap enough to throw out if I ruined it. I bought the more expensive case to use as an everyday case. I received this case first and immd started using it. I'm not crazy about the argyle design, but I figured I'd cover it so it didn't matter. The fact that it fit so well surprised me. It was a thin enough to slide in the side pocket of my purse, but protected the sides and back of phone well. It felt a lot better than silicone cases, that actually would snag my long hair. I received the second more expensive case and was even more surprised to find that the cut outs on the more expensive case were of lesser quality. The cut outs did not have the smoothness of this case. The cut outs on this case are rounded, whereas the other cut outs are blunt and noticable. More importantly, the volume and camera buttons were so much difficult to press on the other case and makes me think I'm going to break my phone. Also, the sides of this case fit snug, where the sides of the other case would not snap on and grab the edges along the screen. After a while however, the more expensive case did soften up and it now does fit along the edges. For the price, you can't go wrong, and again, the quality is actually better than the more expensive case. Who says you get what you pay for?! Ha! I got lucky on this one :) Going to order the pink one too! Yay!",5
,5
"Fits the Droid X perfectly. Other posters are correct in that you can't see the pattern much at all, but I'm VERY happy with that. It just looks smoky black, adds a bit of protection, especially to the corners, and has exactly the very slightly tacky feel that makes it stick in your hands. The hole on the back for the rear speaker and mic is strangely large and strangely located, but not problem. Unlike other posters, I did NOT find the plastic over the on/off, volume, and camera buttons to be a problem. In fact, these areas are slightly RAISED, which I felt made the buttons a little EASIER to find and press than they are on the naked phone. I guess opinions will differ, so mine's just different on this. I would never cut out these areas, as the buttons would then be very hard to press as they would be lower than the case. I have a hard case, but for me, I find that a real pain to remove if I want to put in a backup battery, for example.",5
This cover is slim and has a great grip. The color of the design does not show well but I do not mind. I give it a 4/5 stars. The price can't be beat at 89 cents.,4
"The pattern is very subtle, very classy.  Good coverage of phone.  Not too bulky.  Pattern barely shows.  If you are looking for something loud, this isnt it.",5
I was a bit concerned about it fitting snug to the phone but it went on like a glove and fits on real snug. It is some what clear however the phone is black and it look like a black case with very hard to see pattern. I have no problem with that and I'm very happy with the case. If you can't afford the expensive case then this one is perfect.,5
The cases came to my house very fast. The case fits my Evo nice and snug with elastic on both side of the case. So far it is one of the best constructed cases I had for the phone. Great price! Brought three.,5
"using this pouch for over a week now and would not want to miss it. Used this with the phone in two different snap-on cases and still fits very well. sits securely on belt or pans. Easy to remove phone with one hand (hole bottom middle allows to use the middle finger to push the phone upwards out of pouch). I haven't dropped it once yet doing this. It has no button clip to close the cover, which makes it easy to close and open. Magnet is strong enough to keep it closed even with phone in protective case. The price beats anything you can buy in the store for over $20-30. For the price here I am not even worried about long-term durability.",5
"I would like to return this product because this case absolutely DOES NOT FIT the EVO 4g.The case will not properly close with any kind of .Since it was only $13.93 including shipping, and seller will not pay for return shipping, it will cost more to send it back.Evo  users, don't waste your money.",1
We got this for a family friend who had just gotten Sprint's HTC Evo 4G LTE.  He says he likes it a lot and it functions just the way it should.,5
"Very high quality for the price.  Fit with my Captivate is a bit loose, but acceptable.  I didn't like the combination belt clip / loops at first, but it turns out to provide a more solid anchorage than loops alone, which my last case had.  Removing the phone is a bit awkward, mostly because the phone is so slim, but much easier than with the vertical case I tried before I found this.  Gave away that case; keeping this one.",5
"has the belt loop for no lose situations , clip is nice and snug also. magnetic flap is strong also.",5
"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S (T959V) phone. I haven't been the lease bit disappointed with this.Benefits: I have a soft cover on my phone and it does not interfere with fitting in this case.The case fits my phone perfectly and it seals with a magnetic flap.I can plug in my headphones and listen to music while the phone is in the pouch.You know where your phone is instead of having to search through all your pockets.You can run your belt through the loops for added security or just clip it on your belt.Durability: I have sat on this, smashed it under the couch, slammed it in the car door and countless other abuses but it remains in pristine condition.Conclusion: If you are looking for a leather pouch for your phone, you won't be disappointed with this.Side note: If going through security at the airport or courtroom or any metal detectors, remember this has metal in it for the magnetic clip. It will set the detector off.",5
Excellent product and this is the third one that I have ordered in a years time and I plan on getting another. The product came quickly without issue.,5
This worked really well n my iPhone as long as the back light was turned down kind if low. It keeps noises eyes off your screen while you are texting or whatever.,4
"The material is cut to fit the shape of an iPhone 4's screen.  It fits well and doesn't alter the touch-sensitivity of the device.It's a bit thick, but that's actually an advantage on the iPhone 4 as thin films get pushed up at the edges by any of the bumpers/cases you're forced to use because of the design fault in the iPhone 4's antenna.  This screen protector appears to be manufactured from the same type of material that Elago used for the 3G and 3GS screen protectors, but here's the problem with that: the iPhone 4's display has a higher resolution than that of the 3G/3GS - until that is, you put this screen protector on.  It does provide off-angle viewing privacy, as claimed, but you will not be able to tell the difference between the iPhone 4 display with this film on and that of a 3G/3GS display.Come on manufacturers!! Get your act together and stop ripping us off with yesterday's technology.  The iPhone 4 display needs a better-quality privacy screen protector/film than this.",1
Only an idiot would give this less than five stars.  Only reason is if you know how to effectively apply protectors then these are flawless.  Been two to three months and still on my first one with no bubbles.  Mine is scratched up but that's the protector protecting my investment.  Job well done!!!,5
Adds privacy to your phone and you can't even see the difference while you are using it great item good price,5
When I got this product I put it on the screen under my outter box without taking the wrapping off of the sheild for it to stick to the screen. I was impressed with the way it worked but when I gave my outter box away for a more girly phone case but still wanted to use this sheild with the new case. I had to make it stick to the screen so I removed the tap and stuck it on my screen. It failed to do what it says. You could see exactly what I was doing on my phone. Now if you have an outter box and do not take of the tap to stick it on the screen and just place it on the screen with the protective tape on it then it may be perfect for you. I do not recommend this product for regular cases.,3
"The privacy screen protector completely ruins the view of retina display and resolution of the screen.The privacy screen however does work but it's at the expense of quality of the retina display. This should have been made clear in the product description.The privacy screen (which by the way at this price you get one) appears to have these vertical strands running across the screen protector and this is what provides the 'privacy' at different angles as these strands block the emitting light from the screen at certain angles.Overall, I don't recommend this product, waste of money.",2
"The Droid X is my first cell phone, and this is my first screen protector - so I can't compare this to other products.  That said, I'm very happy with this product.Application was pretty easy.  Once I got the screen peeled back from the sheet it comes on and placed properly, the rest went smoothly.  This comes with a microfiber cloth to clean off the Droid X screen and help remove all lint and dust, and it also comes with an applicator card (basically a plastic card the size of a credit card) to smooth it out and remove bubbles.  For me, those both worked great.  I think that I had one or two bubbles after putting on the screen, and the card helped me remove those easily.This screen protector is just slightly undersized (about 1 mm in height and half that in width), which is a good thing unless you are able to get the placement perfect when you start applying it.  While it won't cover 100% of the screen, it comes close and should cover every part that you'll touch.I got experience using the bare Droid X screen for about two weeks while I waited for this product.  Here are my thoughts between the bare screen and one with this on:- With this screen applied, I actually think that it feels better to use - I'm sure that's completely personal preference.- It seems a bit more difficult to wipe this protector clean of finger prints and oil, but it's not bad at all.- Off-axis viewing of the screen seems slightly degraded with the protector on.  Honestly, though, I'd have to remove the protector to verify that.  It was just one of my first impressions, so I wanted to state it here.Having this protector makes me less stressed that I'll scratch the screen, and I'm very happy with the quality of it and how little it changed the overall view of the screen.  For the price, I highly recommend it.",5
I've been using this for a couple of months and it works just fine.  Easy enough to put on.  Doesn't seem to make the screen any harder to read.  Provides protection.,4
Great protector.  Have been using it for months without fail.  No scratches or corner issues.  Still have the second in reserve yet have no idea when I'll even need it.  I always apply in a steamy bathroom as to keep airborne particles to a minimum and you can barely tell this protector is even on the phone!,5
"Can't even tell the protector screen is on it. It was real easy to put on, I just cleaned the screen with the cloth that came with it and made sure it was clean with no smudges. It took me two tries to align it correctly, but it wasn't hard at all. I used the little card that it came with to smooth the bubbles out of it. Easy to take off, if you made a mistake placing it on the phone. It cleans easy, I can't tell the difference on the screen from when the protector screen is on it and when it isn't. I have had this on my phone, in my purse for over a week now, and it has been protecting my screen great!",5
"Bought these for my new Droid X2 and they are great, crystal clear and easy to put on... very happy with this screen protector. Oh they also cover the area around the screen too:)",5
"I hated this screen protector at first.  The tolerance to the screen is so tight, it was very hard to put on.  I ruined the first one.  But I got the second one on good.  It was a little sticky feeling at first, but once you get a light film on it, it works real smooth for scrolling.  The optical clarity is perfect.  Thats the big selling point for me.  It feels like a tough cover that looks so good, you'll forget you have a screen cover at all.  I will buy again (if I ever need it).",5
"My 2 favorite things about these protectors:1- They really are crystal clear and allow you to view the screen as it was meant to be. I grabbed a pack of screen protectors from VZW when I got my DX, not realizing they were the 'anti-glare' type that make the screen look pixelated and dull. That one went into the trash the moment I got the Seidio version.2- These cover the entire screen, not just the main touchscreen portion (again...as opposed to the crappy VZW version)Fortunately, I've applied a few of these in the past; so I was able to get a perfect application the first time and still have one left over in case I ever need it. To those who think you can't apply one without getting at least some bubbles or dust, you're just not patient enough. And no, I didnt even have to do it with a steamy shower running. This protector has a nice, slick surface on it that makes it easy to use the touchscreen. Yes it gets fingerprints on it, but what glass-like surface doesn't? Microfiber cloths work wonders for cleaning phone screens, as opposed to dirty t-shirts. Seidio protectors will definitely be my choice for all my future phones.",5
It works!  Got this thing applied first time without bubbles.  That's a major feat anymore but Seidio seems to make some of the best screen protectors.  You really do not even notice them once they are applied.  I had one on my previous Droid and it also worked never had to change it.  They definitely protect the screen from occasional scratches that might occur taking in and out of your pocket.  I highly recommend this brand.  You get what you pay for.,5
"This is an ideal screen protector for the Droid X.  It has very easy application, with no messy liquids to deal with.  I've compared this one to other screen protectors and this is is crystal clear when you apply it.  I've had it on for over a month and its holding up great. Love it.",5
"Had no problem at all putting it on. I cleaned the phone very, very well. I did read in one review to place the screen guard on side to side instead of top to bottom, I worked perfectly. I had ONE small bubble at the very corner and it came out with no problem. Can't really tell there is a screen guard on the phone. No problem when using the phone. My finger slides across just like the bare screen I will defiantly buy again.",5
"i had a hard case with a kick stand before this one,it scratched my phone.So i got this one and i love it,if feels good,almost unnoticeable and protects the phone so ... good stuff",5
"This is exactly what I wanted out of a case for my Droid X.  It's a flexible, yet solid plastic material.  The finish is smooth, so it slips in an out of your pocket easily, yet it has enough 'grip' to not slide off of surfaces when you set it down.  It's also very thin, yet feels solid enough to protect the phone, without adding to the already enormous size of the Droid X!  All in all, I think this is the perfect case for this phone, and would highly recommend it.EDITED:  Several months after buying this case, I am noticing a problem, which has caused me to drop my rating from a 5 to a 4.  This case is incompatible with screen protectors.  I tried to use an Invisible Shield, and the edges of the case cause the Invisible Shield to buckle up at the sides.  This ruined my first Invisible Shield, so I got a warranty replacement, and the same thing happened again.  The Droid X has a Gorilla Glass screen, so I'm not too concerned about my lack of screen protector, but I would still prefer to have one on.",4
"I bought this case as a temporary case for my Droid X until I could find one I liked better. The case fit perfectly on my phone with no problems. It held up perfectly for the couple of weeks that I used it. The only thing keeping me from using the case as a permanent case on my phone was that I didn't really like the looks - I wanted something more colorful, and I'm not real big on the plaid-like design on the back of it.",5
"I have purchased cheaper cases, this is the mid/low price level for me. I think I have hit the jackpot. I want something that will protect the case from daily scratches that wont break the bank. It looks great too! Makes the phone look sleek and goes into my pocket smoothly. I will add photos.",5
"This fits the Droid X2 perfectly, does not obstruct the buttons nor the screen, and doesn't make the phone too fat to fit in standardized holsters.  Watch out for other rubberized cases that are too thick, bulky and so will either obscure the screen, the buttons, or prevent you from getting the phone in your pocket or into its holster.Highly recommend this, with two other products that work great together for your droid X2:the clear protectorsFosmon Transparent Clear Screen Protector for Motorola Droid X MB810 with Lint Cleaning Cloth, 3 Packsthe leather carrying case.Leather Pouch Protective Carrying Cell Phone Case for Motorola DROID X,Dell Venue Pro Aero AT&T-; Blackthey all work together as the perfect package for the Droid X2.I've only dropped the phone once, so far - from a height of 3.5 feet - Glad I had the protector on, and phone survived without damage.",5
"Fits very snug on my Droid X, easy to put on. It covers the power button on the top and the volume buttons on the side, but it doesn't make it harder to press those buttons. Keeps the phone pretty light weight. It is nice and firm, and easy to grip. I like it a lot. Haven't had any problems with it so far!",5
Purchased this case a year and a half ago now and it is holding up great. I have the habbit of dropping my phone frequently and this case protects well and stays on great. Perfect fit and looks nice. Not too bulky. I would highly recommend this one!,5
"The Droid X is already plenty big, so I when I went looking for a case I wanted one that added a bit of padding while adding as little bulk as possible.  I was waiting patiently for the Otterbox cases for the DX, but upon seeing them I realized that the higher end models are unecessarily bulky for my needs and the cheapest one has an ugly matte black finish.  The Qmadix Gel is the right price and the strikes the perfect balance of bulk vs. padding.  It's also semi-transparent so it's somewhat attractive.Putting the Qmadix on my DX was very easy and it fits perfectly and stays put.  It's firmer than some silicon cases but it's not rigid.I love that the volume and camera buttons are usable but at the same time fully protected.  I also like the diamond pattern on the back and that the finish on the case is smooth and does not stick to the inside of my pants pocket. The only curiosity is the extra large cutout on the back for the speaker.  Seems they could have made that a little smaller.Note that you will still need to protect your screen; I use an Invisible Shield on mine.",5
I purchased this to replace the snap together leather cover I had for my Droid X because it was almost impossible to get off once snapped so I could use it in my car mount.  This cover fits and looks great and is very easy to take off.  It's the best cover I've seen yet.,5
I've had this case for nearly six months and i haven't felt the need to replace it.  It works great and protects the phone.  It is a perfect size and doesn't add much bulk to the phone - still pocketable.  Highly recommended...,5
"This case fits fine and the molded key overlays work well enough. The feel of the case is the worst aspect. There's a prominent mold flash ridge that runs around the edge of the phone -- right where you grip it. It makes the phone feel cheap and cheesy. The glossy surface shows fingerprints. It doesn't look quite as bad as it feels, but it's a real disappointment after all these glowing reviews.I have the Best Buy 'Platinum Series' version of the Sedio Surface case. It's much better looking and feels better to hold. However, I don't like fussing with a snap-together case to mount the phone in a dock. I'd be fine with the Qmadix case in terms of fit and function, but it's just too nasty to hold.",2
"This cover works well for me.  It is very lightweight but still protective.  I often have to check the edge to see if it is on the phone.  I use a docking station which does require removing the phone from the cover.  The droid x snaps in and out of the cover very easily and quickly, yet has never fallen off unintentionally.  The fit is perfect.  This cover has appropriate cutouts for the camera and speaker.  I highly recommend this cover.",5
"You can tell upon receiving this product that it is quality through and through; from the moment you look at the packaging it comes in.It came with two films in the likely event you struggle to get the first one on without finger prints or massive dust.If you are successful, you have a second one for down the road.Installs easily if you take some time and follow the steps.  I don't recommend pounding coffee when trying to install any screen protector.The stiff film is easier to install than any flexible (droopy) counterpart.I'm sold on this design...Instructions were clear and precise, the product fit perfectly and all the subtle details to make installation painless are covered.A much smoother surface than Invisishield and not prone to peeling after several months; it's well engineered.Finger prints and finger oils deposits are no better, no worse than any other product IMHO.Thoroughly impressed and very satisfied...I like having that smooth tactile response back - never knew how much I had missed it...",5
First off the 1 and 2 tabs are backwards! On most screen savers you remove the 1 first and the 2 last on this one it is backwards! Next it fits horrible with bits hanging off even when centered! Save your self 9 bucks and order cheap screen protectors,1
This film feels like a glass and has less reflection than the one I used earlier which was bought from T-Mobile store and was expensive. It is easier to apply this screen protector and I am loving it. The finger prints and grease accumulation are also lesser compared to my earlier protector.,5
"These are excellent screen protectors.  They fit perfectly, so you have to take your time and apply slowly and carefully.  I've used cheap screen protectors that don't fit properly but these are nice and once you have it on just right, you won't even notice it.",5
"It's been over a Year now since I Bought 2 of these , one for my phone and the other for my Mother. These things are great. The Originals are still on and going strong. I Even have ballastic cases around them and they dont cause any bubbles to them",5
I have used about 8 different screen protectors over the years from cell phones to digital camera screens as well. This product was definitely in the top 3 if not the best one and it's great that includes 2 in the pack. I'll definitely be looking for this brand in the future for screen protection. You won't be disappointed.,5
"This is just an excellent screen cover.  This is the second one I have purchased because of (1)It's ease of installation and (2) The final look, which is virtually invisible.  I was a bit concerned, the first time I installed one because I picked up a piece of lint and also noticed a small air pocket that I could not smooth out.  First...the package includes a piece of tape to lift up the protector, in the event there is lint.  As per the instructions, using a piece of scotch tape, you can just dab the lint off of the protector.  This actually worked!  Second...the air pocket that I thought I would have to live with, vanished on the second day.  Right now I have a protector on that still surprises people when I tell them that it is there.",5
"Applied pretty easily. I did the steamy bathroom environment recommended; had to peel it back partway maybe two times to get aligned properly. Got two tiny airbubbles that pushed out easily. Seems to be a really nice quality screen protector. It cost a little more than some others, but this was one of the easiest I've applied, so I guess it's worth it. Will purchase again.",5
"I've had some experience in the past with these protective covers. The quality of the product was always determined by the environment and steady hand of the person applying it. I figured this to be true of this product as well. So after thoroughly reading the instructions, INCORRECTLY, I proceeded to apply the film to my phone using the wrong side. Lint was all over the place! Suddenly I felt like I was in a dust bowl! 'Great, another crappy product! How in the hell did this thing get such great reviews???' Then it hit me. I'll watch the instructional video on youtube... 'Ohhhh, ok'...Let me just tell you, after applying this product CORRECTLY, it is easily the best protective cover I have ever used. It went on very smoothly, only slightly diminishes the sensitivity of the touch (which was expected), and barely takes away from the vividness and quality of the screen. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this brand again.",5
"I ordered this protector after seeing the good reviews for it; however, after up using it I'm wondering if these glowing reviews are an inside job.I've used many screen protectors before, but I must say this is the worst I've ever used- bar none.  This thing was Bubble City,when I put it on.  I followed the directions to a tee and evenused the 'bubble remover,' but to no avail.  This thing was all bubbles, no matter how hard I tried to remove them.  It also had smudges and attracted dust and hairs.  I would recommend protecting yourself from buying this protector!",1
Wanted a screen protector that was easy to put on and once on could not be seen.  The Realook Premium Screen Protector was just what I was looking for.Pros:Goes on easy.Don't notice a screen protector is on the phone.Cons:Wasn't free.  ;-)--bill,5
"Good price, cheap. But there are imperfections in the screen.. bubbles, etc. I got a Skinomi skin for the other phone and that worked flawlessly.. there may be an advantage to the wet application?",2
This is the best screen protector I have used.  It applies easily if you follow the instructions closely. The fit is perfect. It looks like and feels like it's not even there.  Great price and fast shipping as well!,5
"The package label does say it's for the model phone I have, but the screen protector does not have cutouts for the front camera and light meters like other protectors I have purchease.  Not sure if that means they can &#34;see&#34; through this proitector or not.  May just cut them out myself.",3
"I used to be a HUGE fan of Realook, but I guess I can't expect the same quality in their flat screen protectors from their 3D screen protectors.They're VERY thin, which makes it tough to apply to your screen.  Squeegeeing out air bubbles leaves marks on the screen and makes it look bad.In addition, beware of the case you use with this protector!!!  Some of them will dig under the protector and lift it.",3
"All I have to say is WOW. Didn't believe or understand the excessive positive reviews but after purchasing and installing the screen protector I got to say it is the best screen protector money can buy. The best part 'you won't even notice its there'. This shield is truly invincible when applied correctly and I was able to do so on my first try, free of dust particles or bubbles (easy application). Overall I am happy to have chosen this over any other screen protectors out in the market.",5
I bought this product so I could protect my new phone.  I think it went on pretty easy and is good quality and priced fairly.  I just don't know if it was something I really needed?  The screen is already coated with a scratch resistant material as I saw another owner scape his keys along his display many times to show me.  I guess I have piece of mind.Only con I have is that sometimes the touch function keys at the bottom of the phone don't always have as good of a response as when no cover is on the phone.  Most keystrokes on them are registered but I've noticed when I hold the Home key sometimes it just registers as a press because the device thinks I pressed the 'button' instead of holding my selection.  Overall I am satisfied.,4
This product arrived earlier than expected! The product is easy to apply and was easy to re-apply in case you messed up. This product is cut-to-fit so use the phone speaker to guide the screen protector on properly. I highly recommend this product!,5
"I'm very happy with this screen protector. I've had protectors for my last 3 phones (Diamond, Touch Pro, and Touch Pro2) and this is by far my favorite. There literally is little to no reduction in screen sensitivity nor does it affect colors. While it did take me two tries to apply, they give you a 2 pack probably for this reason. All in all very satisfied.",5
"Like ALOT of others have said, this product is awesome.  I reccomend it to everyone I know that has a Fascinate.  It fits perfectly on the phone and dosent even look like there is anything on it.  They givew you two screen protectors also, so just in case you don't read directions and mess the first one up (like me, plz read directions first, it'll help :D ) they give you a second w/ it.  I got it for my wife's Fascinate as well.  HIGHLY recommend this product.  *It does leave fingerprints, but I just wipe them off everytime the phone is in the power off mode, no biggie.  It's a touch screen, it's going to happen  lol.",5
I bought this for my galaxy s2 from sprint? And it was a perfect fit. It came with 2 screen protectors. My husbands one that we got from sprint was coming off and that screen protector did not even cover the whole screen.  so one was for him and one for me. You pay a little more but it was sure worth the price. It fit so perfect that i bought another one for my brother... WORTH IT............,5
"This was easy to install and they provide the correct tools and directions for ensuring bubbles or dust don't ruin installation.  However, when I aligned the speaker cutout, the protector seemed to be offset on the phone, a little too high.  This causes the protector to slightly bubble when I put on a TPU cover on the top corners.  Seems that this needs to be adjusted a bit.  Also, there are no cutouts for the camera or flash on front.",3
"It arrived quickly, same day i received the Epic. I ordered it because the Other one available on Amazon was bit longer than the phone which my friend had used, so I decided to give this one a try.Installation was easy, the bubbles are easy to get rid of, I found a tiny lint after the install, followed the instruction and got rid of it using a piece of tape. The film is very clear, as if it was never there, the same friend of mine who got the other protector ordered this one after seeing how well it fits.Touch screen response is excellent; the only minor complaint I have is it attracts fingerprint, but can be cleaned easily. Since it is more like a plastic film than the rubbery film like some invisible shields, I am suprised that it did not have any tiny scratch while using the included plastic bubble remover. So it passed my initial durability test, i shall see how well it lasts after month or two.It comes in a more expensive looking plastic container, so the chance of it gets bent during shipping is highly unlikely.By the way, there are two films in the package, for the price and the look, it is hard to beat.",5
"Unlike those other types of screen protectors, you know: Invisible Shield, Ghost Armor, etc etc. If anyone says they sell military grade screen protectors, then it's going to have that orange peel effect and feel like rubber. Definitely not touch screen friendly. On the other hand, this Realook is one of the best I've used. I haven't tested the scratches yet and won't risk it anyways. All you really need to know is that it's great for the money, feels like glass, and I haven't lost any sensitivity because of this screen protector. You will probably get a little small bubble near the headset speaker up top, it's quite common so don't go ballistic because it's not going away. Realook has gained another customer. Hopefully, I remember them next time I need some screen protectors.",5
The protector fits the phone well and is a very precise cut out. The customer service is beyond fantastic. The seller replies quickly to questions and provides a great amount of help and advice in installing.I will be using these protectors on all of my phones and have absolute confidence that this seller will continue providing excellent products and service at a great low price!,5
"As a screen protector, REALOOK is one of the best without compromising feel and clarity too much.  The film goes from edge to edge, which can be good or bad. If you're just rocking the phone bare, this is the screen protector you want. If you have a TPU case or something with a lip that goes over the edge of the screen, the case will push this protector up at the corners. This problem isn't specific to this brand but it applies to all protectors that go edge to edge. Anyways, this was easy to apply and doesn't have the rubbery feel of BestSkinEver or Zagg.  With the Gorilla Glass in the GS2, all you need is a clear thin screen protector and this is it.",4
I bought a screen guard for my ATT Samsung Galaxy S2.It arrived little late due to heavy snow fall in my area.It perfectly fits my phone.Very easy installation.No bubbles at all.My frnds were not able to beleive that there is a screen guard on my phone.Just go with it.Highly recommended.Thanks Realook.This comment is jst given as soon as i installed it.Will give more comments if i face any issue after using it for few days .,5
"Not much to say other than this has been the easiest and most perfect screen protector I've used to date.  Followed the instructions and had everything done within three minutes.  No bubbles, no complicated adhesives, no dust, perfect fit.  I've had this on my phone for a few months now with very heavy usage and still no scratches or wear to speak of.  Shipped free directly from Realook and arrived within two days.  They send you two protectors with your order (for unlikely mistakes or future use down the road).  Outstanding!",5
"This protector is darned-near perfect.  The only problem (and it's a sufficiently minor one, in the master scheme of things that I can live with it) is that it's just a millimeter (maybe even less) too small all-'round.  In other words, it leaves just the tiniest bit of glass uncovered all 'round... but it's really just the tiniest bit... maybe a millimeter, likely less, all 'round.That, however, in my particular case, is almost welcome, though, because I'm fresh off of a bad experience with another brand of PET-material, rigid, dry-apply screen protector of the Realook's type which was too large by almost the same amount as the Realook is too small.And, believe me, with these kinds of protectors, too large is a HUGE problem... a deal-breaker, in fact.  But a tiny bit too small... well... it can be lived with.To better understand the too-large problem, see my review of the other one that I tried first...NU-CLEAR[...]...which, frankly, was about the same quality of material as is the Realook.  They even install similarly.  But that shouldn't surprise me since pretty much all of the PET-material, dry-apply, rigid protectors are surprisingly similar.  It's just that the Realook, by being about as much too small as the NU-CLEAR was too large, actually sits flat on the glass, edge-to-edge.  And having experienced the opposite of that, I can DEFINITELY live with the Realook's being just the tiniest bit too small.Better than 99-point-something percent of the glass is completely protected by the Realook... and that's good enough.  Remember that the whole point of these things is to protect the phone's screen from such as coins and keys scratching the glass when the phone's in one's pocket or purse; or maybe keeping sand and grit from doing essentially the same.  In either of those cases, a protector that covers all but maybe a millimeter (actually, looking more closely at it, I think it's less) of the glass, all 'round, will more-than-adequately protect the glass when in pockets or purses.Of course, we also hope that the protector will help in other circumstances... maybe even if the phone's dropped, or something is dropped on it.  And, again, even a protector that's a millimeter-or-less too small, all 'round, will do that with aplomb.So, I can DEFINITELY live with this Realook being just the tiniest bit too small, all 'round... ESPECIALLY after being so disappointed by the NU-CLEAR, which was almost exactly that amount too large, all 'round... and so, then, wouldn't lie flat at its edges.  The Realook is definitely flat at its edges... and throughout.Therefore, if you can install the Realook properly such that no dust sneaks under it during installation (which can be tricky... you have to really get all the dust off the phone first, and then not have any fans or anything running in the room which might stir-up dust while you're installing), and there are no bubbles (which is actually pretty easy to avoid if you follow the installation instructions)......then this Realook is by-golly just about perfect!  Seriously.  Once it's applied right, with no dust accidentally beneath it, and no bubbles, it's virtually invisible.  And I really mean that.  You can really only see it if you're looking for it, and know what to look for.  For example, if you've ever seen oil on water -- those blue/green wavy colors -- and if you know that seeing such on the screen of a smartphone almost certainly means that there's a PET-material-type screen protector on it, then, yes, you'll notice it with the Realook.  However, that said -- and this is important -- the oil-on-water effect is only about one-one-hundredth as noticeable with the Realook as it is with nearly any other screen protector I've ever seen.  It can really only be seen if you hold the phone at just the right angle, and with just the right light.  Other than that, seriously, this protector virtually disappears.I've read people complain that the Realook is a fingerprint and smear-mark magnet, but we've got two nearly-identical Samsung phones with absolutely identical Gorilla glass, and I took great pains, after installing the Realook on one of them (but not the other), to compare.  And while I think that the Realook might, indeed, show fingerprints and smear marks just the tiniest bit more (and by that I mean a REALLY tiny bit), fingerprints and smears, by-and-large, are little worse on the Realook than on glass, alone.  I'd be lying to say that you can't detect it at all, but, honestly, it's just such a minor difference that I believe it's completely fair to say that the Realook (and I dare say that much the same would be true about most any of these rigid, dry-apply, PET-material protectors, regardless of brand) isn't any worse, when it comes to fingerprints and smearing, than the glass, itself.So that leaves clarity, and feel... to which I say:  Both excellent!Regarding clarity:  It's so darned clear, it's like looking through the glass, alone; like there's no protector at all.  It doesn't darken the screen or reduce brightness one single bit (er... well... actually, the scientist in me knows that some miniscule amount of light is diffused and so isn't making it directly to the eye; but, honestly, it's absolutely imperceptible... so, as a pactical matter, there's no reduction in brightness worthy of mention; and even if there is, it would take but a 1% increase in screen brightness to more-than-compensate).  Colors are excellent... exactly the same as if there were no protector.  Crisp focus.  Seriously, there are NO clarity issues... not a one!Regarding feel:  There is absolutely NO way to make a plastic screen protector -- not even a high-end, PET-material, rigid, so-called 'crystal' one -- feel exactly the same as glass when swiping.  Period.  Whenever people complain that they notice an unacceptable difference in how the swiping feels with the protector, compared with how it feels with glass; and when they say that the glass is better, they're simply asking too much of a product like this.  They just are!  By that, I'm not suggesting that you should settle; that you should accept that swiping on the protector is considerably worse than on glass.  If THAT's the case, then, yes, there's a problem.  But if the swiping on the protector is nearly the same as -- only the tiniest bit worse than -- on the glass, then that's about how it should be; about the best that can be expected.  And this Realook is like that:  There's an almost-imperceptible difference; but, seriously, anyone who can't get used to it in just a matter of from seconds to minutes is just being too persnickety.  Some people, in fact, can't even notice any difference... it's THAT close.  So the swiping feel of the Realook is fine... pretty much the same as the glass, itself.Regarding pressing, some complain that the screen's less sensitive to touch with the protector on it.  In the case of these PET-material, dry-apply, rigid protectors of this Realook's type, I'm here to tell you that that's just bunk!  It's all in their heads!  There is, trust me, absolutely no reduction in sensitivity to touch with the Realook (or pretty much any of its type of protector, regardless of brand) on the screen.  So, don't even worry about THAT one.The trick -- and, seriously, this is huge -- is to by-golly not get any dust beneath the protector (between the protector and the glass) during installation.  And that can be a challenge.  I turned-off all fans in the room.  I did the work on a really clean, hard, flat surface which I thoroughly cleaned.  I washed my hands twice with the kind of soap that really cuts oils; and I did so both before and after doing a general cleaning (with Windex) of the entire phone; and said cleaning of the engtire phonee included using the corner of a business card to loosen all the dirt between the edge of the glass and the metal bezel all around it; and then I blew all the dust out of that crevice, then cleaned the entire phone again.  And when I so cleaned, I used a lint-free cloth such as I use to clean my eye glasses or camera lens.  In fact, if you're a photographer, and you have some lens cleaning sheets, use those.And I did all of such general cleaning AWAY from the smooth, hard, clean work surface that I intended to use for application of the protector.  Then I went and washed my hands a third time.  Then I cleaned the glass with the with the alcohol and both my camera sheets, and the lint-free/microfiber cloth that came with the protector... not once, but three times.... blowing air on the glass each time.When I installed the protector, I worked carefully but fast, kept my fingers off the part that lays against the glass, and got it properly in place with no bubbles.  But there was one -- count 'em:  ONE -- spec of dust which sneaked its way onto the upper-left corner of the glass.  It can almost only be seen if you know what to look for, but it's by-golly there.  ARRRRGGGGHHHH!  But it's so, so, so minor that I can live with it.  Still, it's a hard lesson learned:  Dust is such an issue, and it's actually so difficult to completely eliminate it, that every precaution must be taken.  It almost needs to be applied in a computer hard disk manufacturing clean room in order to virtually guarantee that no dust makes it beneath the protector.  So be REALLY both thorough and careful!!!I gotta' tell ya', though, now that it's on, and I've been testing it, it's magnificent!  Yes, of course, I wish it had been so precisely cut that it covered absolutely every last nanometer of the glass, but the less-than-a-millimeter that it misses, all 'round, is MORE than acceptable.  In fact, once the TPU case is put on the phone, its edges which wrap up and around the bezel, and touch the glass, pretty much cover the part of said glass which the screen protector doesn't.  So, in the end, it's fine!I ordered a Realook for my Samsung Infuse, too, and can't WAIT to install it.Hope that helps!",4
"This cover made my screen look bad... almost like a slight rainbow effect.. It was a pain to apply and after becoming frustrated I removed it and went protector free for a few months!!! Gasp!!!!And guess what.. not a single scratch.. my phone is carried around with my keys, pocket knife, mechanical pencils and after 2 months.. NOT A SINGLE SCRATCH.When gorilla glass is used you do not need a protector anymore save your money.",1
"I've found this product worked great for me.  I will state that my phones are new, so that could have something to do with lack of bubbles?  Not sure.  I have the protectors on and you seriously cannot tell there's a cover.  I'd recommend to anyone with the T-Mobile Samsung Vibrant.",5
I have had other phones that screen protectors were hard to put on.  This came with everything and was very easy to install does not even look like I have a screen protector on it.  I know the samsung captivate has the gorilla screen I put on to protect from constant finger prints.  Yes it does get finger prints but you just have to wipe with lint free cloth.  I,5
"I love these protectors, after using the hot shower trick, they slide on the screen perfectly with no bubbles at all and look absolutely wonderful.",5
"I know, because I'm the idiot.Word of caution - don't try to apply this when you haven't read the directions, can't focus, and/or are talking on a landline. Ugly things happen.They tell you to beware of dust.Believe them.It's a good thing they send two, because that gives you plenty of practice.  The second protector went on like a charm and is indistinguishable from the original screen.  The only way you can tell the difference is that it does tend to keep fingerprints more than the phone screen.I bought this along with a cover (because this phone's plastic is rather flimsy), and couldn't be happier.  It works, it's a little pricey, but it's worth it.",5
Its very clear and your fingers glide smoothly across it with no hang like other screen savers I've tried. Only drawback is that you really need a dust free environment to install it otherwise you will get bubbles.,4
"UPDATE:  Realook sent me a set of their '3D Forming' screen protection films to try out after these went so poorly.  The 3D Forming films _do not_ use a wet application process and extend all the way out to the edge of the screen bezel.While the new films worked exceptionally well compared to the other types I have tried, they did have one big issue:  As soon as I put my S3 back in its TPU case the screen film was pushed off by the case.  This happened every time.  Sadly it appears I will just have to go without a screen protector on my S3 since I am not about to go without a case, and all other protectors I've tried will not grip properly.But if you're just looking for a screen protector and are not putting a case on your phone then the 3D Forming protection films work well.  Thanks for following up Realook!=======Old:I've been using Realook protectors for years, on three different Android devices, and this is the _worst_ set of screen protectors I've seen come out of this normally excellent brand.  (Yes, I followed the installation instructions to the letter, and have applied many protectors over the years)Both screen protectors in the pack failed to get a clean grip on the screen, the texture of these feels terrible when in use, and the slightest bit of grip from something else on the protector causes it to come right off the phone.  No amount of pressing would get the protector to properly apply itself to the screen.  I understand the edges of the S3 make it difficult in the corners, but both of my protectors in this pack had a gap around the _entire_ edge no matter how much I tried.",1
"Sticks good, directions/packaging were fine, but this thing streaked like a mofo.  Took it off after 1 hour.  Glad I didn't waste any more money.  Zagg is the only way to go if you're going w/ a screen protector on a touchscreen.",1
"Like the title says, I love Realook products.  I bought this for my wife's Epic 4G.  Realook screen protectors are the highest quality screen protectors I have found.  I think I have tried every brand for my iPhone, iPad, and now my wife's Epic.  Unfortunately, this product does not have cutouts for the sensors on the Epic 4G.  This has caused inadvertant hangups due to the screen protector covering the proximty sensor.  With other covers that have cutouts, my wife has not experienced this issue.  The thickness of Realook covers may be the cause of the proximty issues on the Epic.  Some Epic forums online have postualted this.  I encourage you to do your own research.When it comes time to replace the screen protector on my HTC Evo, I will be using a Realook screen protector on it.  I have already purchased it and it is lying in wait!  I don't believe it has cutouts, so we shall see what happens when I apply it to the Evo.  My current screen protector on the Evo does not have cutouts, but it is not as thick as past Realook products I have used.",3
"This protector goes on easily, and can be removed with no problems. It protects the screen from moderate scratches and fingerprints.However, it is more difficult to clean, and is a bit less smooth when sliding fingers across the screen. So I removed it after a year.",4
These screen protectors are amazing.  The fit is perfect and the self healing qualities are unbelievable. I will purchase again and again from RealLook.,5
"Install was a breeze, and fitment was perfect on the first try.One of the layers has a strange appearance to it that can be seen when the screen is dark (hence the 4 stars) so at times it looks a little strange.Overall, though, I'm very pleased.",4
This screen protector is great.  It comes with everything you need to install correctly.  I put these on 2 phones now and each one came out great.  The trick is to install them in the bathroom right after taking a shower or just get the room all steamy.  This reduces the dust in the air. Use the tape provided to get any dust that does get under the screen protector.  You will know it is dust when you just can't get rid of the small bubble.  All other bubble will just push away with some doing.I will buy these again and I have already recommended them to others with the same phone.,5
"Everything is great, the product was what I wanted. I am very pleased. I would highly recommend this product to purchase!!!",5
"Very clear and very easy to install.  Use the included bits of tape to pull off any stray dust particles as you apply the protector.It's very slightly 'stickier' than the naked screen.  But my fingers still slide easily along it.  I've had it on for about an hour and it seems to be a little less prone to fingerprints, but not really sure yet.",5
i have been looking at my phone for at least 5 minutes just admiring how good it looks... i had on the amzer screen protector before and i thought that it looked fine with it on I WAS WRONG! this screen protector looks like nothing at all is on it..its perfect... honestly i cant get over how it looks like nothing is even covering the screen! if there is a better screen protector i would love to see it.,5
"Fairly easy to put on, completely invisible once on.  Does not lag the responsiveness of the screen. If I hadn't installed it myself, I would have a hard time believing there's a screen protector on my phone. It's nice that you get two of them, which makes the higher cost a little easier on the wallet.Additional note:  After 8 months I'm still using the original screen protector. The edges are not curling and it is still completely invisible on my screen.  I will often carry my phone in my purse or in my pocket and never worry about scratches.  These are really great protectors.",5
"The protector works great - it hasn't shown any sign of wear.  It was very easy to put on, but I found a small dimple on the screen side that liked to 'suck up' air and that made it hard to get the bubble out.  Oddly enough, little particles of dust get 'absorbed' by the adhesive and don't show up at all.  It even seems like air bubbles get absorbed and go away.Pros:Makes GREAT contact with the screen.Has almost no effect on the screen image.Has no effect on the 'feel' of the screen - it is hard, not tacky.Placement and getting rid of bubbles is easy - almost magical!Cons:Fingerprints show up more than on the bare gorilla glass.Some protectors have small imperfections that can trap a bubble.",4
"My friend bought it first, then I bought it.Fits great looks great. I screwed up putting it on because the numbering for the 2 peeling sides is confusing. but great quality product nonetheless.",5
Worked great. Put the on easily you just have to get extra alcohol to clean the screen. Any little spec of dust and there's a bump on the screen,5
"I have tried countless screen protectors and these by far have impressed me the most.  Installation was a snap, great directions and all the items that were needed were included (2 screen protectors, squeegee, micro fiber cloth, alcohol prep pad, etc).  Screen looks great, nice and clear with no orange peel effect like a few other brands have.  Finger slide seems on par with what I would expect with any protector.  My Captivate looks great - the fit is perfect and it even comes with a camera lens protector which I did not use but it was a nice touch.  You will not be disappointed in these skins.  I was worried after I ordered but after reading some sites with reviews for my phone others have had nothing but good things to say about them. I will use Realook in the future for sure if they keep the quality at this level.  Shipping was super quick too (thursday ordered arrived monday).  Amazon, Realook - thanks!",5
The protector almost completely covered my Epic's face with only the slightest space between the protector and the edge of the phone's face. The product was easy to install and had well written instructions. The only thing is that it claims to be anti-finger print but I can easily see my fingerprints.,5
"When the screen protector is applied, you can't even tell it's there.  It appears to be extremely high quality and very well designed.  The cut of the material is perfect.Applying this screen protector in a steamy bathroom is wise; the steam gets most of the dust out of the air.  Keep a roll of scotch tape nearby too--you can use it to lift up a corner of the protector, and then use another piece of tape to remove any dust particles that may have been trapped underneath.",5
I have four phones with this shield and it's okay. It has been on the phones for about two years. Three out of four have cuts on the film with numerous scratches. I had really liked the product initially because they had great customer service and support. It covers the T-mobile 959 models perfectly.,4
"These are awesome screen protectors!I have ordered them twice.The second time I ordered them I had some issues putting them on and I ended up throwing them away.They didn't seem to fit and were a bit too wide.I wrote a negative review here on Amazon and later I was contacted by the company.They offered to send me out some new ones which was very nice of them.I just put one on and had no issues.It's a bit tricky to install.You have to be very careful not to get dust stuck to it, and you need to line it up very well.Anyhow I deleted my review and I'm writing this one to let everyone know that this is a great screen protector.It has a very clear look to it and doesn't smudge like some other ones.And the customer service is awesome so if you do have some problems be sure to contact them.",5
"It's always good to have more than a few screen protectors to make up for how many times you mess up putting them on your phone....and these are a bargain for the amount you get. As for quality, these are about average, with good scratch protection and reasonable thickness for ease of application. Its kinda hard to find fault given how much you pay for these. Stock up and always have one ready when you need one.",5
"It works as expected. Seems to be pretty durable. Fit was excellent. I think some of the low ratings for screen protectors comes form the difficulty in applying them. It's tricky, but doable. This one is easy to clean and looks like it will last a long time.",5
Never actually got around to installing this since it recommended a very clean environment to avoid unsightly dust problems and the phone has been completely fine without it so I lost motivation.,2
I recieved defective products from seller.  And I've tried contacting the seller but the seller hasn't replied to my inquiry after a week.  The product is great aside from the fact that there is a constant bubble in my screen protector because it was sent to me dented.,1
"great fast shipping, my husband got me addicted to matt finish so love those more now, but this is still great and good price",5
This is the best screen protector that I have had for any phone.  It is completely invisible and has not scratched over the time that I have had it.  The directions even gave me some clues on how to prevent problems that typically occur with applying screen protectors.,5
"Very unhappy because the edges are air, the Samsung S3 have rounded edges, this makes it not a flat surface, it must take into account what the manufacturers screensavers, before I had good experience with the brand in another cell, and so I went back to buy this one, but with the S3 is air around the edge of the screen, the rest all good lens and touch.",1
"Just applied mine to my phone, it looks great, I can hardly tell it is there- BUT WOW was application a pain. Theres a tab 1 and a tab 2, anyone who has used a product like this before knows how this works, tab 1 is attached to a piece of plastic covering that protects the part of the screen that you will be touching later- tab 2 is attached to a second piece which when removed reveals the sticky part that attaches to your phone. However you will find that upon trying to peel away tab 2 (the backing), the sticker comes right off without taking the plastic covering with it.I had received this two pack and upon finding this on the first try, I figured it was a dud and moved on to the second- again the same thing. Finally I figured meh, whatever and started trying to see if that backing was there- and it was so I managed to get the two separated with my nail (I would recommend using thin tweezers however since those do not leave prints).Pros: Looks greatCons: Should not have been that tricky, the sticker for 'tab 2' should actually stay stuck onto the backing not peel off by itself.Advice: Let your shower run for a few minutes with the door closed to fill the room with steam to weigh down the dust in the air. Then apply this in the bathroom with the door closed once most of the moisture dissipates.",3
"The good: A night-and-day difference vs. the freebie protector the store put on when I bought the phone.  Display is every bit as bright and sharp as it is with a bare screen.  Touchscreen works well, although the buttons are still a bit less sensitive than without the protector.  Appears to be relatively fingerprint resistant so far.The bad: A tight and unforgiving fit.  If you're inexperienced in applying these things, expect to ruin one of the two protectors in the pack in the course of figuring out how to align it.  Also, _they are not kidding_ about the importance of applying this in an absolutely clean, dust-free environment: the plastic _attracts_ dust, and one speck on the 'tab 2' backside results in a bubble you can't rub out.  Fingerprints, likewise; you _cannot_ touch the backside, even at the edges.However, once I did get a perfectly clean protector lined up on a perfectly clean phone face, it went on quickly and smoothly with only a couple of bubbles along the edges, which quickly massaged out with the included card.The ugly: I've since read that the Galaxy S phones use a super-hard (and very expensive) glass face that allegedly does not even need a protector.  Perhaps.  This protector works well enough that I'm not inclined to find out.",5
"This product is absolutely perfect. I applied the protector after taking a shower and removed any lint on the phone with some tape and put on the screen protectors. After carefully ironing out the bubbles, I now have a perfect screen. There is no real 'feel' to the protector like the zagg products, and it feels almost glassy (which is a good thing). I'm not getting any loss of touch screen sensitivity either.Realook also has exceptional customer service. My package was bent because my mail carrier bent the package to fit it inside my box, I contacted Realook and they sent me some replacement screen protectors.All in all, I will only look towards Realook for screen protectors for any future phones.Edit 8/22/2011 -I am still on my first screen protector that I bought in February 2011, and it still feels and looks brand new without any scratches. I still have the second one that Realook sent packaged away safely whenever the one on my phone starts to look like crap (if it ever does).",5
"The name is true for this product. I bought this for my Sprint Samsung Epic 4G and it fits the screen perfectly. It is easy to install if you follow the instructions (be careful with dust or hair on the environment when applying it) and it is true, the screen looks as if you had no protector at all! So it is a 'Realook' of the phone screen which is quite important for the Samsung display quality (you don't want a cheap protector that takes away all the nice things of Samsung's impressive Super AMOLED display).Also, the seller (Realook, not Amazon) initially sent me the wrong protector for my phone (it was the wrong size) but in two days I got the right replacement with a prepaid envelop to return the incorrect one. Good service.",5
"I read a few reviews before purchasing the Verizon Samsung Fascinate Premium Screen Protector Crystal Clear 2 Pack by REALOOK. I had ordered a cheapo one previous to this order from a seller other than REALOOK, and it was terrible (Sold by Karen Deals). Unlike that first purchase, the Verizon Samsung Fascinate Premium Screen Protector Crystal Clear 2 Pack by REALOOK is great. It covers the entire front of the phone and protects not only the screen but where the 'home' 'menu' 'back' and 'search' icons are. I had some issues getting it on and with specks, dust, fuzz, fibers. I suppose you don't realize exactly what's floating around in the air around you until you attempt something like this. I took all necessary precautions and followed the directions exactly and still ended up spending 20 minutes adjusting and removing particles. Eventually, after a few choice words and my husband, realizing my frustration, moving to a safe distance ;) - I managed to get it on perfectly, without any specks. Now, I couldn't be happier.Pros:*Crystal Clear - The previous one I'd ordered from another company was an anti-glare/peek one. It was terrible because it magnified the pixels and I couldn't see the screen clearly. This one does not do that. It is completely clear and once applied is barely noticeable.*Size Accurate - I had some issues getting everything to line up just perfectly because of the cut out for the ear speaker. But, once I did that - it fit like a glove.*Package includes everything you need to clean your phone and apply the protector.Cons:It was darn hard to get on without specks, but they all are. 20 minutes of frustration is worth protecting the screen, though.",4
"The newer ones aren't what the old ones were.  I got one 18 months ago.  It was so easy to apply bubble-free, I never wanted to take it off - It lasted that long.  It did have a few very understandable scratches, so I took it off after my replacement came in the mail.  The new version is really thin, rubbery, and they don't have the light-bending that crisped up the display.  It's gone on very, very bubbly, and doesn't come with the liquid for application like it did.  I do believe the film is gass-permeable, so I'll wait a day and see if the bubbles go away (one did the last time I appliedI'm really disappointed.  I feel like gestures are pointless: it's so incredilbly rubbery-sticky.  I wont the old ones back!",1
"I LOVE this brand!! I have used it for 4 different devises. It goes on easy and you can't tell it's even there. MUCH better than other 'military grade' products. This doesn't do that 'orange peel' thing the others do (I've been there). Durability- fantastic! Dropped the phone, it would've damaged the screen if this wasn't on it. YA!!",5
"Pros:Cutouts: Cutouts are exactly where they need to be. The screen protector has been cut perfectly and fits the phone beautifully.Scratch proof: Wow, this is a pretty scratch proof screen protector. I did expect it to be this scratch proof. Pretty good if you drop your phone a lot or keep other things in your handbag/pocket.Application: There were almost no bubbles when I applied this. The only other company which I have seen no bubbles when applying is Splash. Application was very easy, only took a couple of minutes.No Dust: Does not attract any dust like those cheap screen protectors do.Cons:The roughness: When you apply a screen protector it is supposed to make your finger glide across the screen far more easily than the bare screen itself. However, it does exactly the opposite with this one. There is a lot of friction between my finger and the screen protector which shouldn't be there.Fingerprints: I have never in all my life seen a screen get this many fingerprints so quickly! With most other screen protectors I have used you can just wipe off the fingerprints as well as the natural oils from your fingers, but this one just spreads it around.The quality: This isn't a major issue, but the quality of the screen slightly degrades with this screen protector on. It adds a very slight tint which is noticible in very flashy videos, but it shouldn't be a huge issue to people who don't watch too many videos or play a lot of games.The instructions: Wow, the instructions included on how to apply the screen protector are A LOT more complex than they need to be... Seriously, there are like some steps which I don't even understand. The easiest way I found to apply it is to just remove sticker number to and align it correctly. Then use a credit card to remove bubbles.This screen protector is decent... But I wouldn't recommend using it for a long time. As soon as Splash comes out with their Galaxy S II screen protector (which is August 28th) I will be buying theirs at once. No, I am not advertising for them... I just like their protectors a lot because application is extremely simple and they are always precisely cut and have no 'friction' issues.",3
This is the best Facinate screen protector out there. It fits the front of the phone from edge to edge. Perfect fit. Tricky to get on but they all are. Can't even tell its on like the other ones that just cover the screen part. very clear I likey....,5
"I bought realook screen protectors almost a year and a half ago, put them on both of my phones from the first try, and never give them another thought, which should be a high praise.  And I would consider it a five-star product until today, when realook decided to send me a piece of spam hawking I-do-not-care-what.  You are not my friends guys, and I am most certainly not yours.  Off with two stars, and next time I shop for screen protectors I'll consider alternatives.",3
"I've been using this company on all my products for years. This screen protector is easy to clean and is crystal clear. Pre-cut to fit your phone so you know it will work all the time. The install is very reasonable, requires some patience, but is not impossible to do.What impressed me most if the level of customer service of this company. They care about your consumer experience and immediately correct any errors (if any).I highly recommend this product and other products in their store :)",4
"Product was offered as a bundle for my Skyrocket [which is Awesome - if not a bit cumbersome because of the size], so I figured what the heck, lets go for it since it claimed Crystal Clear, anti-glare, anti-fingerprints and easy to install.First the Good News:Yes... crystal clear!Now the Bad News:1. Forget about anti fingerprints - its worse than without the screen protector-major smudging and picks up everything.2. Because its 'Crystal Clear' glare is just as bad as no shield, my wife uses it for a mirror to check her lipstick.3. Installation is a Pain.  Since it is an 'Exact fit' and the Skyrocket has a minuscule raised edge from the case, getting the shield to sit right is a mammoth chore [at least for my aging fingers] Trying to keep it dust free is fun but just getting it to glide onto the screen is for a pro. I got a kink on one side from re-lifting and trying to center.  Took almost an hour to get it straight, no dust, bubble free but the kink shows up on the side.Final Judgement:Overall, if you can find a shield that 'Guarantees' no Glare or Fingerprints and easier installation get it... this one falls short.Update:Spent Double for 'iVisor AG' by MOSHI and got exactly what was promised.No GlareNo fingerprints or smudgesEasy application and perfect fit.Sorry Realook, but they got it right.",1
"I purchased two new T-Mobile Samsung Vibrants a month ago (a great phone, but that's another conversation) and have tried five different types of screen protectors and the Realook is by far the best screen protector.  Once applied you won't realize it's even there.  The screen protector is crystal clear like glass with no rainbow effects, orange peel, or screen clarity degradation issues found on many other screen protectors.  Since the Samsung Galaxy S series of phones come with one of the best screens available on the market today, a screen protector can degrade the excellent picture.  Therefore, beware of 'military grade' products which have a rubber feeling and orange peel texture and ruin the look and tactile feel of the screen. Also, stay away from products advertising 'privacy screens' which cut down viewing angle and more importantly degrade the beautiful AMOLED screen, creating a pixilated look.  There are also a few tricks which will help the application process.  After you clean the screen, cover the entire surface with scotch tape which will remove any dust particles before application.  Install the screen outside.  There are way more dust particles inside your home which can potentially land on the screen during application.  And do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied.  I do not understand why the directions state otherwise.  All other brands have a reverse application procedure which makes more sense by keeping the protective film rigid and thus easier to handle during application.  I hope this review helps your decision. I've spend way more money than intended trying to find a good screen protector and hopefully you won't have too.",5
"Excelente producto, solo que no viene completamente a la medida, hay que cortar un poco en una esquina y las instrucciones de instalacion no estan muy claras.",4
"I've bought and applied countless screen protectors and never have I ever come across a screen protector with such comprehensive packaging and fit as this one.  It comes with an alcohol wipe, a microfiber cloth (much higher quality than anything I've received before with screen protectors, this one has a hefty weight to it), pieces of scotch tape (to remove dust from the sticky side of the screen protector should any accumulate there during installation), and even two pieces of screen protector for the camera glass per screen protector (4 total camera pieces, 2 total front pieces).The front piece is hands down the best fitting screen protector I have ever seen.  Any time people say 'oh you can't tell there's a screen protector on, it's an exaggeration unless they are talking about THIS product.  The fit is ridiculously good and if you apply it bubble free and align it right, you actually cannot tell at all.  I have never seen a fit this good.Some reviews mention that the fit is so tight that a tight fitting case will actually interfere with it and push the edges up, but I can attest that the TPU case from diztronic is perfectly fine with this screen protector, no problems whatsoever.  It's a great combo.The only downside that I've encountered is that the camera piece doesn't stick very well for me, the edges tend to bubble up.  BUT it was an extra that I was not expecting in the first place AND this was my first piece so it's very likely that I didn't install it right in the first place.  Good thing I have 3 more to try with if I feel so inclined eh?Absolutely amazing product.  Recommended wholeheartedly.  For those screen protector nay-sayers that claim gorilla glass is unscratchable and thus does not require a screen protector, they are right in that metal has almost no chance of scratching it.  Keys, coins, knives, gorilla glass handles fine.  Dust, lint, sand in your pocket?  Hairline scratch galore.  Even gorilla glass can't stop that.  Buy a screen protector if you want to prevent hairline scratches.  Buy this one.",5
"Installation was very easy. If the product looks like it comes in a box, it doesn't. Its a folded piece of paper. A bit hard to move some bubbles out, but you really can't go wrong at all. I tried a key scratch test with barely any pressure, and it left marks and I had to take it off. I would give this a 3/5 for protection. I did drop my phone multiple times. Will continue to buy for the price. I also did not notice a screen color/brightness difference.",4
"Purchased the set of two for my boyfriend and I. We both have an epic and these protectors fit really well. Getting them on is a little tricky, but if you follow the directions exactly and take your time, it works great. I forget I even have a screen protector on because it looks so much like the original screen. I also love the cleaning cloth that came with the protectors and I use it everyday to clean my screen. I definitely recommend this product.",5
"After 3 months of use I am disappointed to say that I had to completely change my review from 4 stars to one star. When hurricane sandy hit the east coast I was relying on this as an emergency power supply for my iPhone since our power went out. When I plugged my iPhone in it would start charging then stop, start then stop, start and so on and so on. I tried every different battery combination and my iPhone 4 never got fully charged luckily my computer was fully charged so I plugged my iPhone into its USB port. Overall I was disappointed in how reliable it was. The first day I got it it worked and I only used it one other time after that before the storm and it worked then. I got a mophie powerstation duo instead just in case there is another power outage. Much more expensive but worth it to avoid another incident like that. :-(",1
"The emergency battery charger for my iPod is a great idea. I can charge my ipod or Kindle whenever I want even if I am out of the country. It takes two AA batteries and the USB cord from the iPod or Kindle. Plug the cord into the device and charger and it will charge the device. It does take overnight to fully charge the devices, but that it is worth it to have someway to charge my iPod when I am not near an electric outlet.",5
It came on time. You should know its only for the 1st generation iPod and iPhone!!!!! I ordered it for my iPhone 4 and it wouldn't work for mine or my sisters but it did work for my dads first generation iPod. I also looked it up and it said it was only for the first generation. It also eats your batteries up FAST. It has a light on it but it sucks and doesn't work well. I would've sent it back but I just gave it to my dad. Save your money! Get a better one!!!!!!,3
"I purchased this in the hopes of having an extra emergency boost for my phone.  It arrived timely, and I inserted fresh batteries and tried to give it a go.  No luck with my iphone, I got a message saying it was not compatible with my device.  I then tried the ipad, and could not even get it to register that it was plugged in.  I have a spare charge wire, so I tried changing the wire, and still got no response.  I contacted the seller, who was very responsive, and he quickly sent me another charger, but this one did not work either.  The little flashlight does work on it, but a flashlight is not what i bargained for.",1
"I purchased this device (Emergency Battery Charger w/Flashlight For iPhone 3G 3GS... ) even though I don't have an iPhone or i-anything. My main intention is to use it as a portable battery charger for various USB devices, including cell phone, MP3 player and tablets. In this aspect, the device works quite well - as long as you have a realistic expectation on its power capacity.The device takes its power from two AA batteries, and produces a 5V 500mA output at its USB port. The down-side of using AA batteries is that it has much lower energy density compared to rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack. The up-side is that you can quickly swap in another set of spare batteries (either alkaline or NiMH). This may be important during an extended power outage.I tried to use this device (powered by twoeneloop AAcells) to recharge myPolaroid PMID702Ctablet. After one hour of charging, the red indicator light on this device went out, and the battery status meter of the 702C moved from 38% to 68% during this period. That means a set of AA batteries can only replenish 30% of the energy in my 702C's battery pack (3000mAh). In other words, to full recharge my tablet from 0% to 100%, I will need to use up 3-4 sets of rechargeable AA cells.Although the above result looks discouraging, it actually makes perfect sense from energy conversion point of view:- Each eneloop AA cells contains around 1.25V * 2Ah = 2.5Wh of energy, so two cells contain 5Wh of energy- The combined voltage of two AA NiMH cells is only 2.5V, so it needs to be up-converted to 5V at the USB port- The receiving unit takes this 5V and down-converted to 3.7V to recharge the internal lithium-ion battery- Assuming each conversion is 85% efficient, we still lose 28% energy in the process.- 5Wh * 0.72 = 3.6Wh (that's the energy that actually went into the receiving lithium-ion battery pack)For a 3.7V lithium-ion battery, each 1000mAh corresponds to 3.7Wh of energy. So what the above means is that, after I dumped all 3.6Wh of energy into the battery, I can only increase its charge capacity by about 1000mAh. That's why my 702C tablet's 3000mAh battery pack was only charged up by less than 1/3. On the other hand, 3.6Wh of energy is sufficient to fully recharge my Motorola W755 cell phone's battery pack (940mAh).Given its low cost, this USB charger is still a good value. I just need to bring a few extra sets of eneloop AA cells during my next trip, if I want to fully recharge my tablet using this device.[Other Notes]- The sliding battery door is difficult to open if you grab on to the middle of the case. But if you pull from the bottom of the case, it slides off easily.- The LED light on this device is quite useless. It draws just 0.4mA when powered by two NiMH cells (2.6V). The current increases to 2.7mA when powered by two fresh alkaline cells (3.2V). So the LED's real purpose is to serve as a battery tester.- The output voltage is around 4.6V when delivering 500mA. Under heavy load the current can increase to 770mA, but the output voltage will fall below 4.4V and the receiving USB device may stop charging.",4
Works fine but some of the once i ordered did not work. I noticed right away because the light was not working when i put the batteries.,2
"i wish i could've returned this because it never worked. As soon as I plugged it up, it would give a short to my phone nor did it work at all, DISLIKE!",1
this is horrible i barley have used this product and its already breaking on me the light work but it wont charge now matter what i do i demand a full refund!!!!,1
"At a price of $.01, I figured I'd try it.  Of course, shipping was $4.99?!?  And you have to buy AA batteries for it.  This unit is supposed to charge a phone and has a built in light.  I tried the cable that came with another charger.  No go.  Then I tried the cable that came with the phone.  It charges, but slowly.  The built in light?  Pretty much useless.",1
killed 2 birds with 1 stone in this wallet. I can now hit the bars with my phone and id's in 1 spot and not have to worry about losing it.,5
"I ordered this case for my boyfriend for his Iphone 4.It came in within a couple days- pretty quickly as I remember. Good packaging.I'm very impressed with the product as it's very durable, sleek and a great utility. The phone fits snug into the compartment. It's made out of genuine leather which is an excellent touch. It's something you'll be happy to carry around. Usually these sort of cases are pretty dorky looking. But with this product, it's compact, great design and great quality.This is great for those that don't want to carry around both your phone and wallet. It has slits to stick in your cards, license, or cash.The biggest selling point for me was how sleek & compact it is. We've had it for over a year now and it's still in excellent condition.",4
"Loving this case, i use it with my white iphone 4s and i now dont need a wallet because what its holding for me is  my bank card, my debit card, my ID, my iPhone 4s, and $20 for going out, its almost perfect!, only downside to this case is the need to take the phone out EVERY TIME you need to use it , sometimes i try to use it as a sleeve and slip the phone in and out without opening but sometimes it wont go back in like that so yea, great item but if you get frequent texts and alers dont put the phone back in just yet!, itl get annoying!!(FYI, iphone 4s fits very well without a case, im suspecting a bumper wouldnt be bad but a whole case wont fir for sure.",5
"I ordered the Pink one on July 4, 2012 and received it on July 6, 2012. I have been using it for my HTC Evo 3D ever since it arrived. I have to say that I am very impressed with this case. The Pink is not a bright pink but light and very pretty. The case is very well made with not a stitch out of place and no dents as shown in the pictures posted above. The elastic is tight and holds my phone in place. It slides in easily without a protective case on. Because I don't feel comfortable about my phone being exposed on the corners, I had to see if my phone with a protective case on can fit while in the Bank Case. So far theSeidio ACTIVE Case with Kickstand for HTC EVO 3D - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - BlackandHtc Evo 3d Platinum Fusion Series Red Tpu+black Pc w/ Stand Case Cover Luxmocan be on my phone and fit inside the elastic. The slots for your credit cards can fit at least two per slot. If you're going to put any money in there, you can only put a few bills. I personally wouldn't suggest putting the money in there because it can easily be seen. You can put the money in back of the phone if you like. I was able to put all of those things inside the case and still able to close it. You do have to be careful and not stuff it because you can damage the clasp if you try to force it. Sometimes it wouldn't catch if I put too much in it. I would remove some things and then I was able to close it and hear the snap. The only thing I wish it had was a strap to attach to my wrist. Whenever I go somewhere, I am holding on to my wallet for dear life hoping I don't leave it on a table or something. Anyway, I am very satisfied with my Bank Case.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a multifunctional case for their phone when you feel like carrying light. It is also very affordable for $12.12. The price was $13.63 when I purchased mine last month. I suggest getting it now while it is at this price. Enjoy!",5
"Another example of a &#34;Designed in the USA&#34; made in Asia product, Very Poor Quality, cheaply made materials, a badly executed designed item.  The outside is of a Very Thin Fake Leather covered cardboard cover, that will get dirty immediately upon first use.  Then there is the inside pocket that holds your phone, the stitching was coming apart literally at the seams!  It will scratch the back, sides, and possibly even the front of your phone by just putting it into the stretch piece that holds your phone in place.  It was not tall enough or wide enough for any of the phones listed, nor mine.  I'm surprised that Amazon.com has not pulled this item from the shelf.",1
"No complaints......If you don't mind taking out your cell for everything, then this isn't a bad option. It's genuine leather, so you can stretch those pockets over time to fit more unnecessary receipts and credit cards that you rarely use. The cash flap is nice and holds a moderate amount.....Again, I can't stress this enough to everyone buying a leather product.....Leather will stretch over time, but it takes patience. The swiss leatherware bank did it's job, and will fit in your front pocket without making you look like a bank robber...It's holds a naked iPhone 4 very well, but loose enough that with enough finesse you can shake the phone out without opening it (by shake i mean this... a single snap of the wrist will dislodge the phone about an inch from it's secure position, exposing enough of the phone to pull the rest out). On a personal note, having already given this particular item away to an admirer, I will probably not purchase it again for one simple reason--You have to take out the bloody phone every time you need to use it. It's not a product problem, it's an owner problem. Apparently, when you think you only use your phone a couple times a day, subconsciously when you buy a fancy case, you feel the need to use it more. Go figure.",4
"The reviews so far seem to cover everything but the size.In MM it is Dimensions: 125mm(H) x 60mm(W) x 15mm(D)for Inches Dimensions: 4.7 x 0.9 x 2.5 inchesSo check your phone if it exceeds the case then it will probably not fit.Not for the larger phones, but the Bank II seems to be larger",3
"I needed a wallet and phone carrying combination for traveling and I thought the Swiss name would provide me with great ease and peace of mind. This was not the product that gave me this. It was cheaply made and did not have accurate measurements meaning it fit poorly for my phone and other necessities from my wallet.Pros: PricingCons: Cheaply made, not durable, did not fit many thingsDO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS. Spring for a little more in a better quality product. I did find it suspect that this product be so cheap and now I can see why.Pricing: 5/5Value: 1/5Quality and Durability: 1/5Possibility of having your wallet explode on you: 100/5",1
"When I got the package and opened it up it was already scratched; not too much so I decided to give it a try but once I put my cards and ID in along with my Evo Design, the case became so big I couldn't close it easily anymore. Mind you, I only had two credit cards, a mass transit card, ID and school ID.",1
"This is my second set of these headphones(one white and one black) so I decided to finally write a review on these.The design is great, the main body is shaped similar to the original ipod/iphone headphones that fit and lock in your ear tight and the ear buds themselves end up deeper in your ear. They sit nice and tight in your ear and don't fall out even if you run or jump and this also seals off most of the outside noise, as if you were using ear plugs. This is great for those of us who ride the subway to work or walk down noisy city streets. I have the sound between 25-35% depending on what I'm listening to, and all I hear is the music, no outside noise (just be careful if you're crossing the streets, its easy to just space out and not hear someone honking and what not).For example, before when using my regular iphone headphones, getting out at the Penn station next to the noisy train I could have the music blaring at 75% and still barely hear it, now its not a problem!One feature that I wish they added on this for iphone (3GS and up) users is volume control like the original headsetThe sound on these is decent. It has plenty of lows if you sit the earphone correctly in your ear, they sound much bigger than they are. Crank up the volume to 80 and you'll still hear pounding bass like you would from big headphones. The mids are pretty decent, voice quality is ok. The highs are so so out of the box. You MUST let these burn in for at least 24 hours before putting them on, it makes a big difference, again don't even put them on, take them out of the box, hook them up, turn on a nice song with lots of bass - or a bass test song if you have one or there's a burn in track made by THX you can download- and play it at 60-75 percent volume as long as you can before wearing them.They will get much better as you listen to them, especially the highs(treble) and the vocals.I never had issues with them falling apart like the others have mentioned but my last pair died because of the wiring coming lose right next to the 3.5mm jack and one of the headphones stopped working. Lasted me about 3-4 months, used 5 days a week, taken on and off 4-5 times during the day.This new pair I got, had it for less than a month and again, the sleeve already came off  next to the jack, I'm expecting to buy a replacement in a few months, but for this price I think I'm getting more than my money's worth.My last pair of Klipsch headphones ($80) sounded amazing but still only lasted me about 6 months and again same wire problem at the jack, and it hurt to throw them out.. these, for $13(with shipping) I couldn't care less, toss them in the trash and get new ones and they even sound pretty good. It's a win win. If you're looking for sub $20 headphones, it doesn't get any better than this.",4
"Just got the product, and started using it by pressing the single button on the device. It correctly automatically starts the music player on my Motorola Droid (original). I was a little worried because the right audio was not functioning at first, but it was the phone port not the player's fault. It then picked up the right audio and the sound quality is great.The headphones fit decently well with the standard earpiece, and it is nice to have additional earpieces as well. I shall be testing the other earpieces to see if one fits better, but so far I am pleased with the quality of the product.I have not tested the quality of the microphone sound yet, but it is picking up my voice using the headset, not the built in microphone.The only major downfall so far is the lack of an operating manual. I only discovered the button functionality by accident.",5
Both my partner and I purchased this product for our new HTC Evo's and are very very satisfied. The audio quality is great. Voice and music comes in  loud and clear. And when talking with each other on the phone the voice quality is better than when just using the phone by itself. It comes with 3 different sizes of soft silicon ear buds. I needed to change to the smaller size ones and it fits perfectly in my ears now. My partner uses the medium size ones that are on the headset and they stay in nicely. It even comes with a handy little clip to clip the wire to your clothing if you want to...and a soft pouch carrying case. Great price for what you get.,5
"The box says they're asymmetrical, but they ain't, unless they mean by some microscopic number in microns. Pain in the butt to return things that aren't marked correctly.",1
They hurt my ears and are super fragile. Chord broke easily.,2
"These worked very very well, but the cords were rather flimsy and started to bend and eventually fray after a somewhat disappointing 2 weeks. But the sound quality was still decent",4
"I did not like this immediately. The earbuds are angled and while that may be fine for some people, it is not for me. These would not stay in and the angle bothered me. I returned them one hour after I got them",1
"I read the Amazon reviews before buying this product and thought there was a pretty good chance that I would like the earphones; however, I was very disappointed when I received them.  I used the earphones with my iPhone 4 and they worked well for the first few calls. After that, the quality was abysmal.  I heard lots of crackling and the people that I spoke with also could hear the background noise.  Additionally, I found the silver pieces on the earphones to be awkward and did not help with fitting the earbuds in the ear.  Needless to say, I am returning my earphones and am glad that Amazon has such a good return policy.",1
"just can't get comfortable - they bother my ears. and they lose a star for lack of on/off button. despite that the sound is awesome for the price but comfort is an issue. tested for a few hours driving and various physical activities. sound good, compatible with mytouch 4g, good noise cancelling, stay in ears well. mic sounded better than more expensive pair I'm trying out to person on other end of phone call too. concerned about build quality based on other reviews but for $8 and free shipping they'd be a keeper except for the issues. will probably keep them as backup since the cost to ship back doesn't seem worth it.",3
"It's cheap, sounds good, and does a nice job incorporating the button in the mic assembly.  I'm using it with my HTC Evo 3D.",5
I use these headphones almost on a daily basis on my laptop either to skype w/ friends and family or to watch videos. They're great. I am super happy with the purchase and recommend them for other people. Enjoy. You'll be happy you bought them.,5
"The sound was fine, but the product quality was unimpressive.  The wires came out of the housing on the on/off button repeatedly and was difficult to fix.  stay away, even for the price.",2
"Note:  Used with the Iphone 3GS.  I really wanted to like these headphones (see below).  However, after a week of regular use, they literally fell apart in my hand.  Their appears to be a manufacturing defect in how the two molded pieces of plactic are bound together at the earpiece (I took a picture to upload with this review but I cannot find an option to upload).  I would send them back for a refund, but I discarded the packaging.The reason I really wanted to like the headphones is that the sound was simply incredible, even compared against headphones in the $20.00 range.  Since I am not an audiophile, I cannot provide technical comment on the acoustics.Until the headphones fell apart, they performed extremely well.  They fit in the ear perfectly and were weighted in a manner that helped retain the position of the earpiece in the ear.  When used with the phone to make and receive calls, the sound was fantastic and I actually felt as if the person I was listening to was right next to me. Everyone I spoke to using these headphones reported that I sounded crystal clear.If you do decide to buy these headphones to try out, KEEP THE PACKAGING for 30 days in case they fall apart.  It is possible I was simply unlucky.",1
I bought a set of these earphones back in sept. of last year.  The sound quality was good but the wire from one of the earplugs opened up at the Y point. I superglued it back into the Y point but now a few months later it's pulled loose again. I guess I got my monies worth but definitely won't recommend anyone else buying these!,1
These are very good headphones. When I first got them I really was not sure if they would fit in my ears but once I put them in my ear and they are some of the best headphones I have used. They are very comfortable in your ears and people can hear you very well. I would recommend them to my friends.,5
"If you have an HTC phone (and maybe other brands as well), you've probably had slow charging issues when using USB chargers built for the iPhone (and most of them are).  I have no idea why HTC has their ports set up like they are, but this cable will force it to see the charger as A/C and initiate the 1A fast charge.  This cable is a better solution that having to open and solder all of your chargers.",5
"I feel like I'm being generous by giving this over-priced cable 3 stars. I bought this cable, based on the strength of the reviews. I have a Galaxy Nexus, and the Amazon 2.1A car charger. I figured that with this cable and the amazon car charger, I would finally be able to charge my Galaxy Nexus at AC charge rate, instead of USB. I was wrong.This cable arrived in a very easy to open package, which was nice. I promptly took it out to my car, started the car up, plugged in my Amazon 2.1 amp adapter, plugged in the cable, plugged cable into my Nexus. I checked the charge status and it said 'Charging (USB)'. Tried the 2nd USB jack on the charger, only to get the same result.Lesson learned. Do not buy this cable. You are buying a really expensive data cable only.",3
"As the expression goes, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.  There are several different USB ends, enough that one can't tell by a seller's description which one it is.  In this case, I relied on the list of products it fits to be sure it was the right connection.  It was not.  The end of this wire fits a Kindle.  It does not fit an HTC phone or any other device with that kind of jack, like a Garmin GPS, for example.My advice:  If you need a USB charging cable, go down to your local electronics store.  This was cheap enough, but what is a good price for a useless product?",1
"I recently switched from an iPhone to a Samsung Galaxy Nexus. The Nexus relies on having some pins connected in the charger to enable high current charging; otherwise it only pulls 500 mA. In many cases (such as using GPS in the car), the phone will require more current than 500mA, which means the battery will still be used while charging.I have a high current output USB car charger, though it was designed for Apple devices. With this cable, the Nexus will draw as much current from the charger as it can provide, which actually allows me to use the phone in the car without using battery!The only real complaint I have is that the cable is a bit stiff when it's cold outside, but otherwise, it does what I need it to do!",5
"Perfect for the AT&T Mifi, which has the stupid annoying design that will shut off wireless when a data cable is connected.  Really--who comes up with these brain dead ideas?  This is perfect because I can power the Mifi from the USB port all day long.",5
"I have a Galaxy Nexus and this cable charges my phone in AC mode like I want it to. I did not receive a Naztech Cable though it did come packaged in a Naztech screen protector box. The cable I received is for ATT retail phones, however as it works I have no complaints there.",4
"This is the only tight fitting Micro USB Cable I have been able to find.Not sure why, but lately, all of my charging Micro USB cables have trouble making connection for a charge.Usually, I have to pull the connector to one side or the other to get the charging light on my smartphone to light.Of all the cable, this one is the one that I have to play with the least.Thus I purchased a couple of these for both the car and at home.My wall charger has no cable, just an USB Output connector...same with the cigarette lighter.",5
"My title is a little misleading unless you're familiar with the whole charging scenario surrounding Samsung'sGalaxy Nexusand probably other Android handsets.Many USB port car chargers, including theGriffin Powerjolt Dual Universal USB Micro, claim they are capable of putting out 1 Amp of power on each port. But when connected using a standard USB cable, the phone only allows itself to be charged at the slower USB charging rate of less than  Amp, that in many instances cannot keep up with the current demands of in-car navigation -- not to mention streaming audio and making phone calls. I've ended up at my destination with a nearly depleted battery.With this cable, my Powerjolt can charge my Nexus somewhere on the order of 10% per half hour WITH Navigation and Pandora apps running.This cable is used for charging only. It shorts the two data connections together (rendering them useless), so the Nexus only sees it as a power connection, and will accept the higher current of the charging source (1 Amp Powerjolt charger, in my case). This is confirmed on the Nexus About > Status screen (see my attached image on the main product page), where it indicates the phone is connected to a high-current AC power adapter.With a standard cable, the screen reads Charging (USB), instead of Charging (AC) as shown in the screen shot I posted with the product images.I have yet to connect a meter across the cord to check actual current (don't want to cut my cord open to measure this on my multimeter).The cord is about 4 feet in length, and is very thin and stiff in comparison to just about every other USB cable I own. I don't necessarily object to the thinness of it, but the kinks haven't worked themselves out over time, so it kind of sticks out in 10 different directions as it climbs from my 12v adapter to the phone mounted on my dash.Big shout out to the Galaxy Nexus crowd at AndroidForums who steered me to this cable.",5
I bought this because I had been charging my Galaxy Nexus with a regular usb cable through my PC at work.  It wasn't enough for the amount I use my phone(Way to much).  The standard usb cable couldn't keep up charging it completly and I could leave work with 50% battery even though it had been charging all day long while I was using it.  This cable keeps it at 100% all the time.  It's great.,5
"Purchased September 2012: This is specifically supposed to be a CHARGE ONLY cable but it is a standard micro USB cable which is Different from that advertised. I paid PREMIUM dollars for a CHARGE ONLY Cable. Very disappointed! Charges at USB speeds when connected to a computer.Also noticed doesn't plug into the micro USB well? Seems hard to plug in. Read other recent reviewers and see similar situation, and also thosewere not charge only cables. Appears manufacturer has changed the actual device to a poor quality regular micro USB instead of a Charge Only cable.",1
"I bought a Samsonite Luggage Universal Power Adapter, to use for a trip to Europe. I bought it largely because it has 2 USB outlets, so I thought I could use it (with the appropriate cables) to charge my Galaxy Nexus phone, and my Nexus 7 tablet, at the same time - save me carrying the two chargers for these items. The Samsonite charges the phone OK, but when I connected the Nexus 7 using a regular cable, it didn't charge it at all. To be sure that it wasn't a faulty cable, I tried it with the cable that comes with the Nexus 7 - when that cable is used with the tablet's own charger, it works fine, and the tablet shows that it is 'AC charging' (the higher of the 2 charging levels). So, using that same cable with the Samsonite travel adapter, I expected AT LEAST 'USB charging', but nope, the tablet indicated that it was not being charged at all.So I bought this Naztech cable,and tried it with the Samsonite adapter - bingo!  And not only is the Nexus 7 charging with this cable -- the tablet shows that it is 'AC charging', and it charges quickly. So, this cable is a bit more expensive than the regular cables - but it works!",5
"I ordered 3 of these cables on Sept 7 and they all do the fast charging with our Galaxy Nexus phones.I ordered 6 more of them on Sept 13, and all of them *DO NOT* do fast charging.The difference between the fast charging and the regular USB cables seems to be that the fast charging cables have a 'flag' sticker hanging off the cable where the regular USB cables do not have that sticker.  Otherwise, the packaging and labels on the product were exactly the same.  Though I did notice that the regular USB cable didn't really 'click' when plugged in at the phone end, it didn't fit nearly as well.If the shipper could guarantee that they would ship only the fast charging cables, I'd rate this as a 5 star, but since 2/3rds of the ones I've received did not fast charge, I'd be reluctant to order these again.",1
"I purchased this cable to helpMediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger For iPad and iPhone (3.1 Amp)to charge myLG Optimus Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)using higher powered AC charge mode.  The phone when charged with the cable that came with it by the Mediabridge charger charges in low powered USB charge mode.  But, when using this cable the same phone and charger the phone charges in AC mode rather than USB mode.  AC mode charges the phone more quickly than USB mode.  I charge the phone in the 1.0A slot of the charger.  Charging with fast AC mode allows me to use the phone for GPS while driving with the display at maximum brightness and maintain most of my battery charge.  The phone's battery discharges very quickly when using GPS even when charged by using slow USB charge mode.  This cable helps to take advantage of the optional AC charge mode of some devices.  I'm very happy with this cable.",5
"This cable, in conjunction with a 2.1 amp car adapter, is successfully increasing the battery meter of my Galaxy Nexus, even when the screen is on and gps is running!",5
"Really like the look of this adapter and the cool blue 'hologram' effect of the logo is unique and you know it is getting power. Nice product, quick shipment - well worth getting OEM quality.",5
i just love this charger ..works great have had no problems with it at all and would buy more stuff from this company in future,5
"Not too much one can say about a car charger. Either it works, or it doesn't, right? This does work just fine, and I like the slim and unobtrusive profile of the plugin. I also like the LED-lit glass circle that lets you know the charger is plugged into the socket properly. Other chargers I have tend to utilize a tiny and barely-visible LED, so this feature is appreciated - although I wonder if it may be a tad bright at night. Summary: for 5 bucks, this rocks!",5
"I've ordered more than (1) because of the cool blue light emitted when plugged into my car. They get the job done & look cool to boot, doesn't get much better than that!",5
Acquiring this charger from The OEM Shop saved me a lot of money and aggravation.  The product works as advertised and is one quarter the price of the original.  I certainly will shop with this company again.,4
"I can't believe what they're charging if you try to buy a charger from Verizon, when THIS option is out there!!  I received this on time and it was exactly what was described.  It works great and as far as some of the reviews about the LED light being too bright, I hardly notice it, I think it's fine.  This is definitely OEM, says it right on the product and works perfectly with my Motorola Droid X.",5
This is the original Motorola car charger for mini-USB phones. It works perfectly and has a M hologram glowing in blue in the center. Classic cool Motorola weirdness.,5
This is probably the best charger you can get for your Droid. I really like the nice blue glow from the ring. People ask me what that is under my dash. The price is good and it seems to charge quickly. I would buy again.,5
"It is made overseas of course, but about the least expensive, most protective 2-material case one can find for the price.",5
The item was what I was looking for and arrived exactly as described. I am very happy with this product that I purchased from Amazon.,5
"Thick rubber, very protective.  All factory functions are able to be accessed easily.  the home button is a bit hard to use because of the design of the unit but......  I love it!",5
"This was a poor attempt to duplicating the real OtterBox cover,  Would NOT recommend spending the money on this one. Spend a little more money and get the real thing!",1
Purchased by my daughter. She loves it and it provides just the needed protection for an expensive item that sometimes gets dropped.,5
This case was phone while it lasted. The bling falls off too fast for me so luckily not a lot of money was invested in this case.,4
"I had been searching for a 'bling-bling' Verizon iPhone 4 case and was excitied when I came across this item.  It was exactly what I was looking for and the price was right.  When I got it I quickly saw that it was covered in clear rhinestones all over the front, back and even the corners.  Seems like it is constructed of a very durable hard plastic.  Once I attached the case to my iPhone 4 it was obvious that it is not made for the Verizon iPhone 4G.  The only slot that lined up right was for the camera.  The power/volume and lock buttons did not line up right to the opening and there was even an extra slot on one side (I still don't know what it is for). Also, it sits quite high so all the buttons are sunken into the case.  I did not notice that the rhinestones interfered with the flash like another reviewer stated - maybe it was because it was the only slot that was correctly lined up for me.  This might work better with another generation, but it is not for the Verizon version.  I could keep on using it, but I would rather have a case that is made specifically made for the Verizon iPhone 4G.",2
beads fall off and it is junk regret making purchase as it is worthless in terms of protection and doesn't wear well,1
I love the sparkle on this case. It is super cute and I always get compliments on my case. I am able to change my case with my mood or my outfit and this case by far is the most versatile. :-),5
"I bought this case as a V-day gift for my mom and when it arrived, one of the gems had already fallen off. I think when you buy a phone case like these you know that the gems are likely to fall off the more you use the case. But when you take it out of the package, you don't expect gems to already be off. So I was slightly disappointed.",3
"These are great they cover the back and front, but I do reco getting these button bling. otherwise I got these for my neices and they really help protect the phone.",5
"I liked this case. Easy to add cabochons to, to make a fun cell case. It fit the phone good.",4
Love this case but after a couple of months on my iphone the stones started to fall of the front part of the cover so if you really find that you like it you should order several so you can replace it in a couple of month.,5
I am able to use the case but it does not snap on to the phone like I would like it to. Almost as if it's broken where it is supposed to clip...,3
"I like ths case.  It is very cute.  The larger stones are different and cool.  I have only used it a couple weeks, so not sure how the stones will hold up long-term, but it will look nice for a while either way.",4
"Purchased this case because of its fun design. Don't know how well it protects the phone as I haven't dropped it while it's been in this case. But I'm guessing it may shatter if dropped. Put the case on about two weeks ago, as Valentine's Day was approaching, and here it is Valentine's Day and many of the sparkly decorations have fallen off. Definitely not a case for the long haul.",3
if anybody ask me where i get all my cover from i tell them and you come out a whole lot easy shopping online.,5
"This is an ok case.  It is pretty in its own way. I was not too happy with it.  It is too plain for my taste, but it is pretty.",3
This is just what I expected after looking through the advertised information before I purchased it. My wife loves it.,5
"It looks a lot better than it does online. It also seemed to get tacky after a while. For the price of it, it does its job. Can't really complain about it.",4
"This case fits my phone perfectly! I love it so much, now I know that I don't have to buy expensive cases, this one is in a good price, it's pretty and it's in a good quality!",5
I so enjoy my new case. I love all of the combined colors. I get a lot of compliments. Love it,5
I Love the product. It is very beautiful. It looks exactly as shown and it is more durable than I would have thought!,5
Love the colors and so much better than the picture shows. The beads tend fall off but it's normal for these types of cases.,5
Yet another great case sold by EForcity! My wife got this to protect IPhone and it really is built well!,5
"Looked better in the picture, but fit perfectly.  It is still a good bling case, I received it as directed.",3
I love love love this new case ! It snaps on easily . It looks just like the picture. The colors are beautiful . Would recommend this to zebra print lovers !,5
"The case looked better online, than in hand. They basically took a case and bedazzled it. Lesson learned, the only bling should be on a girls finger ;-)",1
i loved this case until all my stones started falling off espicially around the conners so be careful case i didnt even drop the phone,5
"this cellphone case looks exactly as pictured, its very beautiful, looks amazing and durable! and arrived right on time i would recommend this to anyone!",5
"You get what you pay for, served me well. keep the phone clean and had no problem with it. had to replace after some time because got slick, would use again",4
Want a bumper? Don't get this one. I own about a dozen of different case/bumpers for the phone. This is the only one I would never trust.,1
"Rubber Quality is good, Fits on the phone but not to tight that the side rubber of the bumper is easily loose, rubber attracts dustand the iphone function buttons are not affected even its covered with rubber. Overall it protects the side of your iphone",3
"The bumper sent is not even close to the one pictured. I would not only say don't but this bumper, but don't buy from this seller period.",1
Do not buy this product. What's the point of a bumper that does not fit? Terrible. Just used it for the first time the other day and no wonder why no one in my home has taken out to use it. STAY AWAY!,1
Too soft. It can hold iphone tightly. If I bring it from my pocket. The bumper looks that it prefers to stay in it.,5
Its good and does the job of protecting a fall when the phone is dropped. It grips because of the rubber so on a surface with an angle it still stays put but from a pocket it grabs a little so it does stretch out which is why I had to get another one. but I like it the best of the bumpers used.,4
The case fit well BUT the side volume buttons don't work and the top power/sleep button is hard to access. The case is a total waste of money!,1
"this bumper was very cheap and flimsy. did not fit the phone properly.  howevery, for the price you cannot be picky.  it fulfilled it's purpose. it did roll off the phone if it was in my pocket or purse and i attempted to pull it out to use due to it's flimsyness",3
Needed a new case for my son's iphone and this is the one he had to have and he thinks it is great.,5
Just what I needed for my iphone 3gs. It keeps my phone very secure. I love it very very much.,5
"It isn't all too good of a case, I had an identical one for my iPod 4th gen. That one was fine but this one didn't clip together all to well on the right side. I replaced it shortly after",3
I like to mix it up so I have several colors to change them out.  Keeps my grandchildren entertained & makes me feel young!,5
Its a hard protective Case that was desent priced and is very helpfull in every day use of a active person,5
Just didn't work for me. Phone was too small. My hands are big I kept pushing the wrong buttons. Dont like using a stylus. But it was all wrong.,1
great phone! as advertised and it works perfectly!! also affordable and easy to use. very happy with this purchase! :),5
This is one of the worst phones I have ever owned. I would prefer to go back to my flip phone than ever use this phone again. It processed EVERYTHING way too slow. Often times the Android Operating system would just crash for no reason. Had trouble receiving calls because the processing was so slow. I ever upgraded the memory in it hoping that would solve it and it didn't. I was constantly hard-resetting it to see if clearing all it's memory and cache would help but that did not work either. It may be labeled a smartphone but there was nothing smart about it. This is one of those instances where you get what you pay for.,1
"Highly recommend...I needed a extra phone, just in case something happen to my current phone, at a price i could afford.Everything worked out just fine, it's a great phone.Don't delay...buy it.",5
"returned phone, was not compatible with Verizon contacts backup program, other than that the phone seemed to work okay for me",3
I read reviews after buying the phone and was disappointed but was certain it was the users.... not true. after starting up the phone it runs completely slow and i couldnt even slied through the pics i put on the memory card i had to buy. not worth the money!,1
Definitely paid a whole hell of a lot less for used than new and it came in looking like brand new.,5
"I bought it from Best Buy, and after a month or two, the bottom piece was loose, and shortly thereafter, the bottom bit cracked. It's unfortunate, as their iPod 3rd gen case was great, I put that thing through all sorts of horrible abuse, and it was scratched, but otherwise unharmed. I got theIncipio iPhone 4/4S SILICRYLIC Hard Shell Case with Silicone Core - 1 Pack - Carrying Case - Retail Packaging - Black/Blackand it offers more protection and is much more durable.",1
I always liked my iphone 3g incase and this one is just as great. I purchased the white one because I wanted a shiny finish. The matte ones are nice but don't slide in and out of your pocket as easy. Down side is it's slippery. Purchased from Amazon great 2 day shipping(from Turntable Lab) and they used 'Prestige' as the Shipping Carrier. No problems.,5
"This case is not slick hard plastic, it has a soft touch to it that keeps it from sliding off your lap in the car, but it still slides out of your pocket or purse very easily without flipping your pocket inside out or bringing out all the lint.  All chargers still plug in fine to the bottom through the opening in the case, there is no restrictions like on the Lifeproof cases.",5
"Easy to put on, I love the black color with my white iPhone 4s. i have drop my phone several times, so far the case has protected it very well.",5
"I'VE ALWAYS LIKED INCASE FOR MY iPHONES BUT THIS TIME INCASE HAD SOME FLOWS... THE IPHONE FITS IN THERE TOO TIGHT, YOU CAN'T HAVE A ZAGG FULL BODY PROTECTOR BECAUSE WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT THE IPHONE IN THERE THE PROTECTORS GO TO WASTE. PHONE FITS GREAT WITHOUT ANY PROTECTORS BUT WHO WOULD WANNA DO THIS. I HAD TO DO SOME ADJUSTMENTS ON THE CASE SO MY PHONE WOULD FIT IN THERE.",5
"The case cracked after a few weeks of use, one on the bottom by the connector and one on the top by the volume controls. I contacted Incase and they sent a new case out in about a week.",2
I used a white Incase with my iPhone 3G and loved it.  This case I love just as much.  Good fit and protects my iPhone4 just like it should.,5
"I am one of those guys who drops his phone a LOT. I tried the thinner snap cases, but they didn't offer enough protection. This case is a good balance between sleekness and protection. It's my favorite vase around.I've been through probably seven different types of iPhone cases over the past four years. But I keep coming back to this one.This case is very, very thin for a full coverage case. You don't notice it after just a few minutes. I consider that a plus. It's the slimmest &#34;full protection&#34; case I've found. My only complaint is that they occasionally break when dropped, and I'm now on my third one. But as I said, I drop my iPhone way more than average.",4
"This case will not fit the iphone 4s perfect it will be very snug, this case is made for the iphone 4g",3
"I had this case on iPhone 4S for nearly a year. It saved the phone few times but cracked on first fall. I had to glue it up few times after that (even without falls) but couple days ago I dropped phone again from the high about the knee on hardwood floor and case finally just felt in thousand pieces so nothing left to glue. I really liked the case as It sits tight and had excellent grip but it's too fragile to give it even 3 stars. I bought Case Crown instead, it feels more rubbish so hopefully will protect the phone from falls without falling apart.There is another disadvantage for those who use camera with flash as it severely 'milks' the picture because flash light reflects from case edges and gets back to the lens. Case Crown does not possess this effect -- I never thought that case could be the problem from that point of view until noticed it accidentally by taking picture without case. Used to blame iPhone 4S LED flash for this.P.S. I never use screen protectors as phone changes way before the screen could get scratched to useless state so I can not comment on this side.",2
"Since I got my first iPhone (3G) I guess 3 years ago now, I have always used Incase to protect my phones. I've dropped my phones a thousand times; concrete, pavement, tile, even in snow - you name it I probably have mistakenly had my iPhones interact with the given surface. These cases have always protected my iPhones of all models 5 Star service for sure, they come in lots of colors and options; shiny/matte.... Don't waste money else where this case will go above and beyond!",5
"This is the second InCase Slider Case I've owned for my iPhone 4 (I also had one on my 3G and 3GS). I do like the case, but for me, it's a no-go. You cannot use any kind of screen protection with the phone. I have been using one of these since I got my iPhone and I have yet to get a scratch on my phone luckily but I've talked to others that have (read the reviews, the inability to use a screen protector is a bit of an issue all-around).Also, I use the Griffin charging cable (10ft, I believe) and I can't use it with this case. If you move the phone after it's been plugged in, it will unplug because the cable doesn't snap in properly due to the case only being made to accept the smaller charging cables.However, my biggest complaint with these cases is that after some use, the two halves don't line up properly anymore and there's some play in one side of the case. This happened to the black one I had and now it's happened to the gray one. I dropped my phone with the black one on and that's when I noticed it, but the grey one that I have (purchased at BestBuy) was like that right off the bat. I exchanged it out and got a new one and within a month or so it was doing the same thing. This one has not been dropped, so I'm not sure what the issue is, but something is causing the cases to maybe stretch out or something. perhaps their manufacturing tolerances are a touch too tight.I still rate this case very highly because it looks nice, doesn't add a lot of bulk and does add some drop protection, although with no rubber padding or anything, I wouldn't recommend throwing the phone around or rough-housing with it.PROS:* Good, clean fit* Attractive design/color options* Doesn't add too much bulk or weight to the phoneCONS:* Too tight to add a screen protector* The glossy cases scratch easily and the soft touch/matte cases get gouges in them if they rub against keys, etc. (better the case than the phone though)* Doesn't allow for larger peripherals because of the tight tolerances",4
"It's a great looking case and I didn't have any problems except that I dropped it 3 times on concrete and it was toast. It did its job though, my phone was unscathed, but if you want rugged, this isn't what you need.",4
"This looks and works great.  However, I have one complaint.  They purposely make it so most screen protectors won't fit with this.  I'm sure this is a shady marketing attempt to force you to buy their compatible screen protectors.  Kind of annoying and really a turn off.  I use a privacy screen from another company that I like, so I had to buy a new screen protector and cut it down just so it would fit this case.  Unfortunately, I haven't found another case that I like so I'm kind of at Incase's mercy.  However, the moment I find another case I like, I'll quickly leave Incase's products behind.  Purely out of principle.  I just think it's shady to purposely make a case that's incompatible with other screen protectors.  Shame on you Incase.  That's why I'm giving this product 3 stars instead of 5.",3
"I love how the two pieces slide together to really, securely stay on the phone no matter what.  There's no other case worth checking out.  This is sturdy plastic that will not crack or break at the first fall. Get it.",5
"Incredible phone for the price, it's not WIFI capable but is Data plan ready, touch screen for dialing # only, texting is done on the key board, i'm happy with my purchased. This phone has alot of features for such a cheap price..",5
Got this for my 12 year old and its an he loves it because of the slider and easy to use keypad,5
"I have this as a backup phone, and it works good for the price. The touchscreen is a joke, though- it can only be used to dial phone numbers.Please note this uses a full-size SIM card, not a micro or nano. I had to get an adapter from my micro-SIM in my Galaxy S4.Do not buy this for a Verizon or Sprint service (or Cricket, Virgin Mobile, or Boost)- it will not work.",4
"To start with not such a good looking phone.Yes, it is unlocked. But all carrier features are not supported, which is a big inconvenience.The price is good, but I would advise researching the Amazon market for similarly priced phones with more features.2.4&#34; touchscreen too small for meAll in all a good buy, if you want to use it as a second phone.",3
"I gave this phone a 3 because of the size.  It is really really small.  I brought it for my husband and thought it would work as a second phone.  However, when I seen the size i was disappointed.  Just know it's a basic phone, but I guess ok for the price.",3
This is not an apple bumper case. It is a cheap knock off and doesn't work as well as other covers.,2
"Cheap plastic design, feels cheap too.You'll wonder why you put you expensive iPhone in such a cheap bumper.You can do better than this.",1
"It's probably the most unassuming bumper I've ever seen. It works, study yet flexible. For just a couple of bucks it's no-nonsense.",3
I do not like how it fits.. Not a great product.. I'm would suggest spending the extra money on an otterbox! At least it will last you longer than a couple of months! You get what you pay for!,1
i paid $3 for it and i got what i paid for. it's a temporary protection and definitely not for a long-term solution. it's too rubberly and so easy to be taken off and it looks cheap. but this is one of the best $3 bumpers out there.,2
does what a bumper does! not a whole lot more to say. it fits the iphone and offers the protection a bumper case offers!,4
"As I said this ear piece is very comfortable.  The price is great.  The plug is solid.  The device comes with a &#34;phone call answer and end button&#34; on-board.  However, the sound quality seems to be below what is required for consistent use.  I have never had anyone complain about my microphone (speaking) quality.  The issue is with the receiving ear speaker.  All calls are slightly muffled.  Because of this at times I find it almost impossible to understand the words of some calls.  This is probably the case when their microphone is of poor quality - so the combined result creates unintelligible audio.",4
Great headset.  Fits well over ear and good sounding.  Like that it doesn't shift much while using even though I have glasses on.,5
Can barely hear out of it and it doesn't fit phone needs adapter for my iPhone 4S. Don't recommend for iPhones!!!,1
"I am not the blue tooth kind of guy and wanted a cheap way to listen to podcasts and make/take calls on the way home from work.  I tried a number of products and this is best one we have found.It has a 3.5 mm plug so make sure your device supports this or plan to buy an adapterFits great over the ear and gives very good soundCan be reversed for left or right earsI get great feedback from my older parents on how clear I soundIt has a button on the earpiece that can be used to stop/start podcasts on my phone and hang up at the end of a call.I have an LG Droid with VerizonIn Albuquerque it is the law to be hands free and this is a great solution.  I bought a total of five of these so I have one in the office, home, car and spare.  The fifth is for my wife as she has taken it for herself and now won't go back to the poor reception and short battery life of the bluetooth.",4
"Do not buy, very uncomfortable and poor quality. It has been a waste of money. I guess you get what you pay for.",1
"Tried this case out since it was so cheap, and it seemed to work decently well. However, after removing the case a few times for battery pulls, the smaller top piece began to crack in the corner, and eventually cracked all the way through.  The pieces snapped together tightly, but never quite aligned quite right.  I picked up the tpu argyle flex gel skin at the same time, and that has worked out far more durably, even if it is a bit thicker.",2
I am used to my silicone rubber case that is easier to grip.  Not really what I wanted but my son loved it so it has a new home.,3
I received it on time. Actually sooner than expected. I no longer use the phn but am sure that it's a great case.,5
"Protects the phone great. Tight fit, so the phone does not fall out. Great grip to it and seems like it's one of the best.",5
This black rubberized case does not stay snapped on my phone. It have to continually snap the left side together. And it always comes unsnapped. The feel of the case is nice and it is attractive. It just doesn't stay snapped.,2
I have had a Droid for about two years now.  I had been looking for a case and couldn't find one for the right price.  As I came across  this one I was shocked by the good deal.  The case was well packaged and received quickly.,5
"I don't really know what to say about this.  It came in 2.5 days, it snapped together perfectly on my DroidX, the fit is perfect, it seems like it will provide the right amount of protection, the openings line up perfectly with all the push buttons (the power button is just slightly tricky) it looks great and I can still fit the phone in the belt pouch that came with the phone (it's tight but I'm sure will stretch a little).  This is really a great product!",5
"I noted the unit reviewed very highly in the various smartphone forums, and the price was right.  So, I gave the unit a try.I'm happy; it holds the phone securely and keeps it visible.  It allows either vertical or horizontal positioning, and the cord connection from the Droid X clears the mounting and holding ears perfectly.The unit rattles LOUDLY when the phone is out of the holder....but to stop it all you have to do is close the holding tabs (as if the phone was in the unit).  It quiets right down then.Spring release quickly and safely releases the phone.",5
"Great cell phone holder.  This company, while i've never heard of them deliver a quality product and you can tell they really thought things through. ie, they give you 2 alcohol pads to wipe down your dash or window for a better hold.  The base is heavy and sturdy and sticky and if that weren't enough, there's a little hook you can stick so it stays put.  Quality all around.",5
The suction pad has stopped working and it keep falling off the stand in the few months I've had it. I've stopped using it as I'm afraid my phone will break as it has fallen few times.,1
"Plainly simple, the title says it all. I've owned several universal docks from Walmart and other places, this thing is beyond perfect. It has a bottom friction fabric of sorts that holds the unit perfectly in place on the dashboard. It does vibrate without the phone in it, but its not an issue since my phone is always in it. 5 stars all the way, don't think about it just get it. I already convinced some of my friends to get one too.",5
"Live this mount! Works amazing with my GS3 (headphone port on top) but did not work as well with my galaxy nexus when both usb and headphone cable (both on bottom) were plugged in. It does however fit both phones with otterbox cases and smallerPros:Fits large smartphones (GS3,nexus)Dashmount doesn't slideCons:Slight rattle when emptyNot good with headphone outlets on bottom but do-able",4
"Drove around town with it today while using my Droid X to navigate using GPS. Did not use the tether, but probably will install it later as a precaution. The mount sits firmly on my dash, no slippage, and held my Droid X securely with its adjustable cushioned grips. Easy to orient phone in direction you're most comfortable with. Well worth the money in my opinion.",5
I replaced an adhesive windshield mount that had failed completely with this weighted dash mount and am very happy with it.  I did install the (tiny) adhesive hook on a flat spot on the dashboard but with that I have a solid and stable mount.  I coupled this with a 90 degree angle microUSB power adapter for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and I have a very nice in car GPS.  I also purchased the camera mount version of this and it's easy to detach the center portion (standard levered suction cup) and swap out my phone for a standard camera on the dash.,5
"I tried on of those green stick to the phone things on a recent trip and found it worthless for me so returned it.  There was 2 problems I had with it.  First, if you are renting a car, you don't want to glue the disc that mounts to the dash on a rental and without that and laws that prevent windshield suction use, most cars don't have a place to suction such a device.  Second, If you use almost any kind of case with your phone, that green stick to won't stay stuck to.  This item solves both those problems.  The weighted part can be used in almost any dash and is easily just lifted when done so can be used in multiple vehicles.  It ratchets closed on your phone so it will not fall off and releases with a button.  It also comes with one of those stick on disc that you can use in your on vehicle for a more permanent place to suction if you choose and just take the waited pad with you when you travel.  This is a great item.  I use it with a Note 2 so it will fit a large phone.",5
I was concerned the Note would be too big for these mounts but tried this model because the top part was unhindered.  The Note just about fits nicely in this mount. It actually can swivel to give you landscape making the Note a perfect navigation device. The base is very sturdy and firm (not moldable) but I have not had any issues with it moving around. I got this for under twenty and came back to buy another but price had gone up decreasing the value to price ratio :(,4
I bought this to hold a Galaxy S4 with an Otterbox case. I was concerned because I thought the phone case would not fit- but it does with room to spare! It sits firmly on the dash and securely hold the phone. Great for using you phone like a GPS.,5
dont' like the suction cup techology used to attach dock to the beanbag  Other than that is seems to be ok,2
"I wasn't expecting much at this price point so when I received the unit I was very pleasantly surprised with the robust quality and excellent function of this unit.  As others have stated it will hold the unit either vertically or horizontally and the ports are accessible on my Samsung Vibrant (aka Galaxy S).The spring loaded clamps that actually hold onto the phone are padded with a nice, thick and very compliant foam padding to keep the phone securely in place.  The 'sandbag' base is surprisingly and pleasantly heavy to give the unit some stability on the dashboard.Highly recommended.",5
"I Ordered it for my HTC EVO. It has a good grip on the dash, does not slide, but vibrate a little. If you already have a Garmin Dashboard Friction Mount for your GPS, do not expect the same, since that is specifically designed for such device. But for a universal dash friction stand, probably it is the best you can find. Be aware that the bottom of the friction stand is firm & does not shape to the surface of your dash, like Garmin that made like sand bag & molds to the shape of your dash. So you get the best out of this, if the surface of your dash is flat without any curves.",4
"Bought this for my Galaxy S (Vibrant) with hopes of using the phone in my car more for streaming music and GPS.This worked great in my wife's car, but not in mine, as I don't really have a flat surface on my dash.  The curves of the dash made the friction mount wobble a bit and not be as sturdy as I'd like.  Plus, the friction pad was a bit bigger than I was expecting (not that it's a bad thing, I guess I didn't expect it to be that substantial).The windshield mount, however, worked great on the windshield (it also stayed securely on the friction pad).  It has a bunch of different settings that allow you to easily change the angle/direction of your phone.  It fits the phone very snug and I never worried about its security.Overall I think this would work great for many people, but just didn't work out for me.  I've stopped using it in my car and now use the windshield mount as a phone dock in my office (attached to a window).",3
Very nice easy to use universal phone holder. Works with my very large Samsung Galaxy 3 and worked well with my smaller razr maxx,5
"Arkon Mount Bundle is a great mount. Suction cup is not so great, it regularly falls off, in hot or in cold. It easily holds any smart phone. I use it with iphone 4S. I mounted it on my old friction mount I bought a few years ago for my Garmin Nuvi. Garmin is practically dead, works only when plugged in, but the mount is perfect and its ball like handle fits into this Arkon holder. Works great for me, but if you try using it with a suction cup on a windshield or on different friction mounts it will fall off. Beware.",4
"I bought this for my boyfriend's Droid Incredible, and it fits great. It also fit my brother's Droid Razor perfectly. It is easy to attach, and seems pretty durable.My one complaint is that we put it in out old Jeep, which isn't the smoothest ride. The arms loosened their grip, and the phone fell out. I'm sure it would be fine in newer cars, rather than a '92 XJ driving over a dirt road with no sway bars...10/30/13:Update- he took it out of the Jeep to put in his other car, and it won't stick. :(",4
I bought this for my droid X. It is adjusting so new cells i get or friends phones will fit in it. Has two adjusting points that will position your phone where you need it. Highly recommended.,5
This is great. I bought this for my Galaxy S3 and it holds it with no problems (even with a case on the GS3)! This is a must if you have any smartphone and use it as a GPS.,5
WILL NOT FIT THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 1 OR 2 IN A CASE. I HAVE TO TAKE THE PHONE OUT OF THE CASE AND AT THAT IT JUST BARELY FITS. KEEPS HITTING THE VOLUME OR ON/OFF BUTTONS ALL THE TIME.,2
"I don't own a car yet, so I haven't permanently affixed this anywhere. I have, however, used it several times in rental cars on road trips and it's perfect for that. I just run an audio cable and a usb cable for power and it's good to go. Swivels whichever way you want, but I keep it in landscape for GPS.",4
"This didn't last... The joints came loose, the suction gave out and the whole thing turned to junk within just a few months.",1
"Overall I like this mount.  I use this for a Samsung Infuse, which is a fairly large phone at 5' long, 2.6' wide.  Since the top of the mount is open ended, the length isn't a problem.  The width opens up to about 4', which is more than wide enough for any phone.  Pushing the button on the side of the mount releases the padded arms to full width.  From there you squeeze the arms back in and they 'click' as they lock into place against your phone.  For a firm hold, make sure you give it an extra squeeze so the foam really sinks in against the phone.The suction cup seems to hold really well.  I have the suction cup mounted directly to my windshield, though there is an adhesive backed plastic disk you can use if you doubt the flatness of your mounting surface.  I've been zooming around town fairly aggressively with this thing on my windshield and it has held strong so far.  The flip lever design for the suction cup tends to work very well in my experience.The holdster for the phone is removable from the mount and while on the mount can rotate 360 degrees.  There is a spin-locking nut on the back to hold the given rotation in place.So overall this mount does everything it needs to do and I like it.  If I had to critique, I'd say that the entire thing is a bit of a contraption.  There are so many adjustments that it can come across as unwieldy until you get it set up just as you like it.  It's also a tad bit larger than I would like, but that is the price you pay for such a versatile device.  Overall, it's very good.",4
"The only car mount I've ever liked. Infinite positioning, never falls.Be aware that over time, if you are lazy and don't open and close the sides each time, it will begin to flake off little pieces of foam.",5
Great price for great functionality. I've used it with both iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 and it allows for maximum flexibility in connection types.,5
Super convienent for when im driving and looking at directions.  I have bought 2 more since purchasing this item.  One for my dads car and one for my moms car.,5
"The holder vibrates a lot and is almost imposible keep an eye on the screen. And it keep falling from the windshield and because one time my door was opened, the holder touched the street and broke in two.",1
"Arkon has really come a far way from the last few years. I have had 3 of their in car mounts and each new update they get better and better. I have had this mount in my car the last year and a half. Having both very hot summers and Extreme winter conditions I can tell you I have never had a mount stick so well to the window before. I have used in multiple cars and this mount does the job for all of my devices. it does fit the Moto M, S2, S3, s4. the best part is with the &#34;feet' on the bottom, they can be moved left and right on their track just in case you have a charging port at the bottom. Arkon thought of everything. Even the hooks on the side have an opening for power and volume buttons. This Arkon is spring loaded and is easy to place your phone in and lock the sides tight.  I would definitely purchase again.",5
"Almost any size cell phone fits into this holder.  It really makes a difference being able to place your cell phone up and out of the way while you are driving and makes using speaker phone easy.  My wife didn't want one at first, but after she saw how great it was I ended up getting one for her side of the car.  I'm now getting an Arkon holder for a 10&#34; tablet since I had such a positive experience with this holder.",5
not what i expected. the little pad you can stick on the dash is pretty good. the suction works fine. my problem is the feel of the mount is flimsy and cheap. feels like it will fall apart while handling it in your hands. lesson learned.,3
"I have tried just about every possible mounts out there for various cell phones I have. While each mount has its pros and cons, this one is by far the easiest to use and the most simple design.  Press the side arms to close, and press the button to release. Slide the feet below to accommodate for the power connection (if your phone has the usb connector on the bottom).  This mount fits even the large phone, and the one I use right now is the LG G2.  I don't think it will fit the Galaxy Note, however.",5
"Very happy with purchase, the last item i owed was cheaply made. This keeps my phone steady and it doesnt shake at all while driving, very impressed! Also, the suction is super strong, I am happy I brought it!!!",5
"This is by far the worst case out there for the iphone 4 but I did try giving it a chance.My first exolife was defective so I sent it back. It would not charge even when plugged into a usb charging adapter.Thankfully amazon understood and sent me another one with one day shipping no charge.My second exolife was working well. It charged as it was supposed to and it even synced on iTunes which most cases such as the mophie case do not do.I was pleasantly pleased with the case because it felt right and was thinner than it's competitions but then after two weeks.The case died. I tried to charge it by itself and it did not work.I also noticed that when charging, it will not charge your phone at the same time as other cases do. What you have to do is turn on the case then charge it with your phone plugged in.I feel like exogear just wants you to charge the case and phone separately which should not be the case..Also, once the phone is in the case, it is a pain to take out. The little notch it has to press to release the bumper does not help at all and unless you plan on keeping the phone in the case as I did until it broke, I do not suggest this case.I hate this case and it's thin profile is not worth the trouble, I would suggest the mophie air or phone suit(e)The only pro is that it sync with iTunes other than that it fails as it's intended design",1
"This is a great-looking product that works great until it breaks.Unfortunately, the battery pack is held on by a plastic band that goes around the outer edge of the phone.  This plastic is very thin in two places (over the 'mute' rocker switch).  Mine broke here within two  months of owning the battery pack (not dropped or abused in any way).I emailed the company at their warranty address three weeks ago with no response.I have tried to call multiple times and always get voice mail and no one returns my calls.This would be a great product except for this one design flaw, and except for the terrible warranty service.",2
The exolife iphone 4 battery case operates as suggested. I have found the battery MORE than doubles the duration of power to my iphone4.  The battery will come on automatically or you can power up the aux battery manually.  I suggest that you try it for yourself.  You can't bet the product or the PRICE.,5
"I have been looking for a battery case that does not add many bulk to my iPhone and found this one on engadget.com the review is between 3 battery case. I was really impressed to see this brand I never hear of before to win best battery case. So I tried it and I am content with the purchase.What I like;1. Good customer service. I had a little problem with bumper noise like other user here but exogear fixed problem right away!2. Clever transparent bumper to show the iPhone beautiful design by seeing through and continued design all around the case3. Changeable bumper color, I did not buy yet but I think later I have option to buy is attractive to me4. Slim and thin designWhat I don't like;1. A little hard to open the case (maybe I am not smart enough, but the box is hard to open!)2. The battery time is ok, I can get 75% usually, I was little disappointed but I saw other net reviewer say 70%3. Plastics, it feels like plastic but it is plastic, I don't know if this is possible to complain? I wanted more iPhone feeling like other reviewer say but maybe I am expecting too much4. Price is too high, now can buy 3G case for $50 why 4 case so much money! Is this price of new design? I feel it too high.I gave 3 star because the product is pretty good and because there customer service was really good to me. Even though my English is not good, they help me a lot and have patient to me. I wanted give more rating but I didn't because price was too high for me. So I feel like it to be 3 is best.-----------------------------------------------UPDATE FOR USING THIS PRODUCT ABOUT 3 MONTHI have been using this case everyday so far. I still like the sleek design much better than any other battery case design. I don't understand why people complain about things like not comfortable, feels cheap, doesn't charge 100% or less.. etc. For me, it fits perfectly in my hand and never feels bulky or feels cheap. What kind of quality do you expect? I don't see any quality difference from other cases for less than $100. Even the Samsung Galaxy S smart phone feels cheap and it's a $500 gadget. The bumper(or whatever they call) also fits snugly, exactly around the iphone without any gap (after they replaced my case). The bumper bends little bit, but I get the idea why because if it doesn't, it will cause to break the bumper when put it on the case or take it off. Another reason I like this case is that it is a snap-on style, not sliding style which causes to crack iPhone's glass.Yes, I agree it doesn't double the battery. But, what other battery cases this size does? With using same technology and similar price range, you shouldn't really expect or blame thing that are common in the same product market. When I do use it, which I do everyday, I go from 0% to 85% easily.Actually, I got replacement case for some issue without any trouble and still like their customer support. What I received back was a matte finish case which I didn't expect. What I had before is glossy one. I like both finish but, I like matte one better personally. It feels better in the hand, like more grip. I wanted get another color bumper for this battery case from Amazon but, couldn't find any. Only able to get it from their website. I am just waiting for it to buy on Amazon with expecting cheaper price.I think the company should update the information for the battery case not to confuse future consumers.I will see how long this battery case last and reliable.Other than that, I am very happy to use it so far, I even gave it an extra star.",4
"The reviews were real good so I bit the bullet and spent the money. It does the job BUT.....It's heavy, bulky, awkward to hold and I can't find a case big enough to wear it on a belt. If I had to do it all over again, I'd pass.",3
it works good if you have to use a micro in a reg sim but you have to tape it to the adapter it makes it harder to put it in and take it out,4
"works great,  been using for about a week.  from iphone4 to blackberry.  worth the buy mcant ever go wrong especially with my case when im waiting for a replacement iphone4 and my other phone is a bberry",5
I like these sim adapters so much I ordered a second set you can never have to many of a good thing !!,5
sometimes i travel abroad to my country.  and some phones i use there still require the old Sim Cards.  I use this to compensate for the short-commings! nyahahaha,5
"They're OK. But if you buy the SIM cutter, the cutter cuts a perforation through and you can use it as a SIM card adapter.",3
It came early but with only 1 adaptor insideIt seems ok but then inside was only one adaptorAnd now I can use only one sim while I need two,1
There isn't much to say about a power supply that just works.  I charge my HTC Thunderbolt and my HTC Nexus One as well.  It is good.,5
"Pluses and minuses (In order of importance)+ Works with my battery-draining HTC Thunderbolt- Doesn't come with cord, so you either use an extra cord that you have lying around, swap out one cord with multiple outlets, or you need to buy an extra cord that is sold separately.+ Came exactly as advertised- For 'Free shipping' Amazon Prime gurus: If you choose to buy an extra cord separately, there weren't any amazon prime vendors that have the cord available for free 2 day shipping when I ordered mine... Minor pain, but the split shipping was worth the cheaper overall cost.",5
"This is a nice and compact USB charger that outputs 1000 mA current good for most devices except iPad/iPad2/Amazon Kindle Fire.Its thin form factor means it won't block any adjacent power outlets when it is plugged into the wall or an extension power strip.Since the price difference between one with a micro USB cable and without is only 61 cents, I would suggest getting one with the cable.If you need an extra iPad charger (2100 mA output current), I would recommend AmazonBasicsAmazonBasics Wall Charger with USB Outlet( 2.1 Amp Output).",5
My family have 3 HTC Phones and I needed extras for traveling. I use one for work and use one for home. I needed few more when traveling and this was a bargain than having to pay for the Original OEM product. I am not sure if this is OEM but works great. for the price i have no complaint.  Charges my HTC phones and also my Google Nexus and Kindle fire Hd.  of course it takes a lot longer to charge the Tablet than the phones.. but charges them also  (Tablets take more time to charge using phone chargers .. its a given unless you buy the  the chargers meant for those tablets ie. more amps then charging time is drastically reduced),5

"Yeah, yeah, I know we're not supposed to review the seller with the product, but based on other reviews, I ordered this U250 from CCMAccessories. What arrived in OEM packaging (little nondescript corn starch bag) was a 79H00095 charger. Initial test with my HTC Amaze and HTC cable, this charger provided > 800mA of charge current, which other so-called 1000mA chargers do not. See my photo in the gallery to see what kind of smooth charge curve you should see.So for charging my HTC, this charger was what I needed, the correct HTC part that charges faster and more efficiently than third party brands that claim to be the same, but actually charge up my phone slower.",5
"A word of caution, when I ordered this I sent an all-in-one vehicle cigarette lighter charger for a vehicle with a USB Mini B jack, which is completely useless for an HTC Thunderbolt.",3
Don't waste your time. I guess I got what I payed for because it was very cheap. It looks like the real thing but it's garbage. It takes my phone at least 12 hours to charge everytime and it's not my battery...Never again...,1
"Didn't have any problems with this charger. It is durable, and does the job. No problems on my end! !",5
"Arrived as described & on time. Items could have been packed better. Ordered two, one was fine the other was scratched and marred. Both work normally.",4
"Nice smooth looking design, small footprint, can fit with other devices on one power strip... and bonus!  The output of this charger is pretty high.  It can charge my Kindle Fire, which requires 1 amp, most phone chargers can not do that.",5
"These are perfect and cheap enough to have a few on hand. Keep some at work, home and in your luggage.",5
"I have the original htc wall charger and order this one as well...the usb cable does goes completely in maybe a mm isnt in...it caused it to not charge at times. I dont know if this is a fake, but I am not using it again, i dont want some sort of shortage happening to my phone",2
"I really like this one - it's attractive, small, and it works. We have 3 Samsung Galaxy S3's and all in, I probably have about 6 of these and haven't had a bit of trouble. One reviewer mentioned that it charges slowly, and while I've not done a formal test, I can't tell a difference between this and the larger, less attractive OEM one I have, or my OEM car chargers, all of which seem to take forever. IE, I think the S3 just takes forever to charge, no matter what you use.",4
"This is a HTC oem product.  It is the exact same USB plug that comes with the HTC Evo.  It is clearly marked on the plug that it is HTC, rated at 5v 1A.I bought one just to have a spare plug in the office.  As you may know that the Evo is a bit of a battery hog so I wanted to make sure that I had a plug that was rated for my phone and of a quality build.I would gladly recommend this product as it is the exact OEM replacment for your Evo.  Note, you need to have the USB cable to plug into your phone and into this plug for charging.  Search Amazon and you'll see the cable too.",5
it worked for a little bit and then it stopped working out of no where. i probably used it for about two or 3 weeks,2
"I highly recommend this product to all Smart phone users. It is compact , light weight  and can be used to charge many phones like BLACK BERRY , Samsung, NOKIA and all HTCs",5
"I ordered this charger because I lost the original that came with my phone. I keep 2, one at home and one I carry with me all times. It arrived by the promised date and in perfect, new condition. No scratches or anything that would make me think it's used or fake. I've charged my telephone a couple of times and it works just fine. The only thing I can complain about is that doesn't include the USB cable. Other than that, its perfect for the price. I'll give it 4 stars because they didn't include the cable.",4
I needed a new plug and when I ordered this one I was surprised how soon I got it. Thank you,5
"I got this to use as a secondary charger for my Thunderbolt.  It works great, and I can't even tell which one was my original and which one I bought from Amazon. It works great!",5
"I picked this up because I needed a spare plug for travel. I also wanted to have an extra lying around since I have a tendency to lose things. This plug looks and functions exactly like the original that came with my phone from Sprint. No isses at all with charging. The plug feels solidly built, and not cheap in anyway. I would easily recommend this to anyone with an HTC Evo phone. I'm glad I made the purchase, as it has worked out really well for me.",5
"The classic sign of crappy power adapters is that your device screen locks up or nearly so. That's what my palm, my android, and my old motorola phone all did. If you put a scope on the power it's quite noisy - and thats what affects your device.For that reason I long ago stopped buying OEM clone stuff as while hit or miss the misses were just a PITA and it's had to tell.So I only buy genuine brand - usually Motorola or in this case HTC.This one looks great - but behaved poorly and locked up my HTC Android device when plugged in. Comparing it closely, the printing on the back is similar - but different. More Chinese characters - and some word issues - like 'Emerson' printed as 'Emer son'. Another sign was the packaging - just in foam wrap - not even in a sealed bulk OEM pack.It may well be that this seller is getting a mixed bag of good genuine and crappy (but good looking) clones. But I've lost faith in them. Hopefully I can find somebody that has genuine stuff at a decent price that's all confirmable.",1
"This plug is great to have in addition to the one that came with the phone, you can just plug it in in other locations around the house or work, good to have.",5
worked great my old one stopped working and i couldn't find a replacement so i came on here and found it,5
still alive and kicking. works for even iphone usb cords. love this thing. charges fast and lasts a while! thanks,5
I have used this all over and has never let me down. I believe it is an OEM product. Worth the price.,5
although I said 'new' my charger was shipped in a clear back and had scratches on it.  I am not hear to judge the seller so here's the review.  I love this charger because it doesn't run hot.  I can plug it anywhere and will fit on a power strip without clearance issue. I do wish it could rotate but thats ok. the charging seems to be faster with an Amazon USB cable.,5
Very helpful. I have bought four of these and it is nice to be able to carry  just a cord and already have these plugged in to the walls everywhere.,5
"This is the HTC model charger that comes with the Thunderbolt and as far as I know, other similar HTC phone models. For some reason, the Thunderbolt is very choosy on where it gets power. I have bought 3 of these now with high end USB cables and my t-bolt is actually lasting longer per charge then when I was charging it with the Verizon crap they sell.This is obviously an OEM product as it comes in a little plastic baggy that looks as though they got it from a device box. Either way, it's the real authentic charger and it works.",5
"The official chargers just seem to work best.needed a replacement for my old school EVO 4G, this hit the spot.",4
"Lately I have been noticing that my HTC Evo heats up whenever I use a generic charger on it...it also take three times as long to charge. So when I saw the price on this HTC Charger, I bought it and simply used a generic USB to Micro USB cable on it to connect it to my phone and now my phone no longer overheats and charges very quickly.",5
"Not much to say except this charger base works with no problems to mention. It is a good price too, its too bad others aren't getting the right or same product.",4
Thanks HTC for making a dual purpose charger! I can leave the plug in the socket and still use the cord in a USB adapter or slot.,5
"This car charger was a last minute check out buy, while I was purchasing some cell phone cases. The reviews on this product are definitely all over the place, with some people complaining of the poor quality of it. However, I've had no issues with this, but will admit that it does feel cheap and looks a bit cheap as well.Pros:- Very small, so it takes up less room in your glove box- The price can't be beat- Eliminates electrical spaghetti that most people have when you open their glove boxCons:- Cheap look and feel- Moving part that winds cord will probably stop working eventuallyOverall this is a decent product that does what it says and can easily be stored, however the cheap quality of it, combined with the moving internal part lead to a three star review.",3
"Captivate Car Charger / B003WNYMX8I bought this for use with my Samsung Captivate. The connection to the phone works fine. Nice and snug, with no problems either connecting or un-connecting. The connection to the car dock works well enough - the fit is just a little bit loose and can 'shake free' on bumpy car rides; fortunately, the charger has a light that goes out when the connection is lost, so it's easy to notice and fix if the charger does shake loose. The retractable cord is nice, although you do have to coax the last inch or two to retract - I guess they didn't want the connector to smack violently into the charger each time you retract.The charger itself seems to work well enough, but it definitely doesn't put out the same level of juice that you'll get from your wall charger. With the phone screen on and speaker phone going, the charger just barely manages to keep the battery level steady - I would imagine that heavy usage of the phone (music, video, etc. while driving) would be too much for the charger to handle. Still, I purchased the charger to help take the edge off the daily drain on my phone, so this charger works sufficiently well for my needs.~ Ana Mardoll",3
I love how this retracts! It has a little button and retracts really fast for easy storage. I also like the little blue light it has to show you it's ready to charge. The plug easily comes off that kinda sucks..but hey for the price it was well worth it. FYI: I bought charger for my Samsung Captivate and works great.,4
"For the life of me, I don't remember buying this product. And since it was for the Captivate, I can guarantee that I didn't buy this product for that phone. I'm beginning to wonder if Amazon's db has been corrupted, hacked or otherwise compromised. But the IDEA of having a retractable cord to charge the phone is a good one. I hate having cords dangle all over the place.",4
This is very convenient.  It is nice and compact and the cord does not get tangled up with any of my other cable devices in the car.Only thing is that sometimes I have to remove my cell phone cover in order to connect the cable.,4
"Love this contraction it's not all over my car's floor and the amount of cord allowed is just the perfect length with out it springing back pulling you towards the lighter in the middle lower part of the dashboard in the car, like others seem to do with the curly cord. After your done talking the easy spin button takes it in neatly and out of harms way for driving; which is a very important plus for me.",5
"This works great with my Samsung Captivate.I love the retractable feature because I don't have to worry about its cord getting tangled with my other chargers for other devices. And, of course, the price was great, too.",5
"Love this item, as the cord retracts, and I do not have to worry about snagging the cord on anything or closing the glove box on the cord. I love this item",5
I love the way this works.  It saves space by retracting its cord.  It work like any other charger but with the retractable cord.  I will continue using it.,5
This charger fit perfectly and was so handy and the retractable cord is great. The charger works great. I recommend this charger.,5
This is an amazing product! It took me a while to figure out how to retract it but it's great! It has a blue light to let you know it's on and working.,5
"This is much better than the charging cable that came with my Samsung Captivate. The charging cable that came with my phone is like one of those hard wire leashes that they use at the bank to tie down their pens at the teller window. This charger is flexible and retractable. Takes very little space in my glove box when not in use.  Also, no long cables making a spaghetti-like clutter all over the passenger seat or floor of the car. Just press the button and the charging cable retracts quickly. I love it!",5
I think it works fine. It does not charge as fast as an at home charger but I knew that before I bought it. It's a car charger that does what its supposed to.,4
This is an excellent S m a r t P h o n e at a reasonable cost . .,5
"excellent product! it came exactly as described! Perfect for international users like myself! I recomended to everyone, works just fine in the US, Latin America, Europe and Asia!",5
Bought this for a friend. They have not had any problems with it so far. Blackberry phones can be problematic at times if not maintained regularly by updating and cleaning up the phone system. This particular model is a good buy for the price if you want to BBM.,3
"It was all I asked.I think there is a small factory mistake with all the white blackberries, which is the keyboard get loose a little, and the central bottom get stucked a little.",4
"Disculpen la tardanza en la calificaci&oacute;n y comentarios... excelente producto, 100% nuevo y original! de regalo para mi esposa y quedo muy satisfecha con la compra",5
This product was so flimsy. It was made out of plastic ans broke within the first couple of days. I will not ever buy a case like this again. The item arrived the estimated day but that is why I rated this two stars. You get what you pay for!,2
This transaction was simple and fast. I ordered it i think on a weekend and it was there by thursday a week before estimated delivery. It was a great deal. The case itself wasn't white like it said it was going to be it was more clear and transparent but it fit my phone well and did what i needed it to. Over all i was very satisfied with the transaction. Just wish i would of known it wasn't white.,4
"With the price of this product, I had the mentality that I can afford to change out my screen protector with just the slightest scratch or smudge. But I've been using the same screen protector for months, and still no scratch, so there're no need to change it out. This 3 pack will last me the lifetime of my phone.",5
"It was only disappointing because I thought it would be white, based on the picture...I know it says 'transparent white' but the picture looked pretty solid so that was what I expected. It's more like a dried elmer's glue color. Not very pretty.",3
"This is a nice case that is easy to take on and off and which fits openings on Droid X2 fine.  And it is bright red, which I like.  But somehow it makes my phone look a tad plastic.  I dunno, maybe they needed to fiddle with the color a bit to take away the child's toy quality.",4
"Super cheap, but it does what it says it will and it protects your screen. No surprise here. Does the job.",4
i like the idea of protecting my droid but wish it had been a little thicker and the yellow color does not match what is advertised on the site but i will be able to spot it right off the bat!!!,3
the cover do what it made for.. cover my phone... and protect from getting damage... well by it if i need to.,5
Don't think your getting what the picture shows. This is a CLEAR transparent cover that does its job kind of. Rubber gets stretched and falls off.,1
"I purchased this case for my new droid and I love it.  It is a snug fit and never comes loose or fall off.  I have dropped it many times and it has been a life saver, not even allowing a scratch.",5
"The case works fine and fits the phone great. I was expecting the case to be more white though. The case I received was almost clear. I think the picture is a bit deceiving in that regard. Overall, the case works fine, and I received it within 4 days of ordering.",3
First tip if you are going to put a screen protector do it FIRST!The reason is because this case once you put it on it will be impossible to take off; well you either get lucky and it comes off or you break it.  As for the case it is built quite well and for that price it is very nice.  Only clear shell I have seen and I am quite happy with it.,5
"I got 2, one for mine and one for my husband, mine would not stay on my phone but my husbands works great",3
"The price cannot be argued; I saw one for sale for $6 and at an airport, for $15! The smoothness is great and with practice (twice for me), no air bubbles remain except a few persistent patches on the margins that refuse to go away. It does not dim the screen much at all, and feels nice to the touch. Three for the price here is a bargain.But, how do you remove the residue of the tab that shows you where to place the cover before laying it down over the phone screen? I tried one on, and the bit from the top-down portion had sticky residue from the 'remove before applying' section. I failed to remove it, so some stickiness remained that I found impossible to get rid of. I left the protector on, and it lasted a few weeks, but the small part that was dog-eared at the corner where the residue did not allow a clean fit over the Droid-X screen. The section that did not stick to the screen slowly grew into a flap and as this was where the finger swoops to open up e-mails and such from the top margin menu, it had to be discarded.Second time, with a second protector, I figured I'd remove the residue first and put the protector on the other direction, so the stickiness would be on the lower-right instead of top-left portion, a less important area of the screen. But, again, I could not eradicate the residue. Both times, the tab stuck on the plastic cover and could not be removed. I scraped it off with the mini-squeegee, but it left a blistered mess that puckers up, is an ugly white, and which obscures the screen for about 5% of the total, a mess on that corner.So, I have a protected screen, but with a compromise: a hideous whitened patch that puckers up and looks as if a big milk stain, or worse, boiled the corner of my phone. I have a snap-on plastic case to cover up the sides, so that helps a bit, but if the edges are not perfectly aligned, they will begin to fray and dog-ear. The second time, the protector glided on well, but both times, the stubbornness of the sticker residue, ironically, makes this a strange compromise between a better protected screen and a more ugly phone surface, given the blistering.",3
"Soft enough to be comforting and grippy. Hard enough to not get all stretched out and useless. Thin enough to not make you feel like you are ruining you phone by turning it into a brick, thick enough to protect your phone.And SO CHEAP",5
Are you kidding me? For a penny I bought 4 of them just in case I tear one. I actually gave one to a friend.,5
AWESOME!  Love it! Love the color.  It protects my phone perfectly.  Love the price. Ordering another colored one today. Thanks.,5
Fantastic product for the price. Just as good as any other hard case out there and a fraction of the price. Arrived on time.,4
"In general, I like them. They must, however, be trimmed.  They are too large.  They should only be large enough to fit the actual screen.  They are somewhat larger than that.  They are easy enough to trim.",3
"My granddaughter pointed me to these cases. I wanted the flexible case and not the rigid ones that I could get at the Verizon store. Not to mention these are a heck of lot cheaper than theirs.I like that I can sit it in the space behind the steering wheel & it doesn't slide all over. Easy access to all the buttons, camera & microphone. I think I'm going to order the rainbow of them so I can change the case when I'm in the mood.",5
really good screen saver hard to get all bubbles outr from undr these but does the job of protecting the phone,4
like the cover i have lots of themn where i order them all the time love to just change up on the colors,5
Fits the phome well. not quite up to the thickness of the Otterbox but at a way better price. I was not willing to spend a lot more to protect a 2 year old phone that was coming off contract soon. So this product worked well at a good price point,4
I like this holster because it keeps the phone and the holster thin and close to your side so if you have on a suit it will not show a phone bulk.,4
"This does just what You would expect from a rubber, slip over, cover.  If You need protection, and You dont want to spend alot.  This is it.",5
I would get one of these in a different color i love it it protects yet it is soft and forms to the phone,5
"It has been holding up well.  My autistic daughter uses it with my old Droid X  all the time.  It hasn't been damaged yet, which is saying something because she has managed to damage a number of (sibling) iPod touches, as well as other devices with much less time on them.  It also holds the batter cover on which is the only part of the device that isn't perfect.  This could be partially due to the construction of the Droid X, though, which was a fantastic phone in its time.",5
"THis cover works very well even with the extended battery pack (original cover).  The Body Glove cover I had compressed the screen too much and caused bubbles in the screen display.  Remove the cover and the bubble dissapeared.  This case does not do that.  Grip is good (slips in and out of my pocket easily but still offers a decent grip).  Color really looks good on the black phone.  I know these tend to get dirty and fade over time so I'm sure the color will eventually look not so nice, but right now I'm pleased.  The pattern does not show up as good as the picture shows, but that is no biggie to me.  All the port cut outs line up well except the rear speaker cutout.  It is WAY too big and offset.  I really like the covered rocker switchs.  My phone has a super sensitive on/ off button and this cover helps prevent the constant accidental/ battery draining screen turn on that occurs in my pocket.  The volume switch is a little harder to operate but not a huge deal as I usually use the software volume contols anyway.  Have not tried the camera button as again I use the software control. All in all I'm please with this cover.  It fits nice and snug, does not cause screen issues, and should offer some level of protection if the phone takes a tumble.",5
"It is flimsy, slips off my droid x, and sticks to my pocket. It doesn't really feel right on the droid. I was hoping for a silicone case like the one I had for my chocolate three that would stick to my dash and not slip. This on only sticks to my pocket.",3
"My wife loves it!  Easy to use, charging unit included!It includes a portable charging unit.Support two phones, easy to use!Battery has a long lifeSmall, confortable",5
"I won this Jabra Stone from a Jabra Facebook contest, so I cannot complain about it, but if I had purchased it, I would.Battery life is weak; it goes dead more rapidly than my Jabra Extreme.As far as the fit, it is not uncomfortable and does not dig on my ear, but it easily dislodges (also, it only fits the right ear).  If I adjust my headband or glasses, it falls off.Volume adjustment is easy, as is the on/off and bluetooth dialing, but if I had to purchase a new bluetooth headset, this would not be my choice.",2
The damn thing didn't work I was to busy to return it had a lot going on so now I wasted my money on this thing and I'm stuck with a worthless piece of plastic.,1
"When I say it is a bad design  the look and feel  of the headset is beautiful,  The comfort is the best I have ever worn,  it does not use different size earpieces which never seem to work, the ear piece goes in sideways which is unique and very comfortable.  The problems with it are as follows.  The entire side of the unit is your answer and hang up button.  If it starts to slip out of your ear and you push it back in,  you hang up on your call.  I got my wife one also and she hung up on someone three times, it is difficult to avoid.  The volume control is unique others had an issue with it hanging up their calls and I can see that happing since you have to gently glide your finger up and down the side to control the volume,  a little too much pressure and goodbye.  To charge the unit or turn it off you must return it to the stone holder, the USB charge is on that device only, if you forget the base at home you cannot charge it while on the road or turn it off.  The other problem I have with it taking it out of the stone base is supposed to turn it on and activate it, I had to place it back in the base and remove it three times to get it to turn on.  This has not been an uncommon problem for me, I called tech support and they told me to exchange it.  I would like to see Jabra take  the over all design and lose the stone piece place a usb connector and a real on off switch with a more pronounced answer key.  Not sure how they would design it but the comfort of this headset is better than any I have tried.  I also purchased the Jabra Extreme to try and that is a very good headset, I can write more about it later but the extreme like other headsets begins to hurt your ear after you have been wearing it for an extended time.  Bottom line I don't recommend the Jabra Stone.",2
"I purchased the Jabra Stone with the hope that I could enjoy a modern piece of equipment but after buying it, I regret having done so. This item is far from user friendly and pretty much uncomfortable to wear. for one thing it keeps slipping from the ear which makes it hard to listen during conversation especially if you wear Glasses. Not a crisp clear sound like they claim.  what is worse is that every time I went to push it back to continue my conversation, I would accidentally disconnect the caller. This is embarrassing when making a deal over the phone with my customers.  Battery life is also very bad, I think it was 30 mins before I heard the warning beep between charges.  The only feature I enjoy is that the unit is concealed and looks very high tech. Also the base to carry it on charges the unit which is convenient. The most important aspects of this unit, Not So Good.  It has not been a month since I purchased my Unit and regrettably I had an unfortunate incindent because as I mentioned it does not sit securely in the ear. I was watching my hands and when I went to remove my glasses to wipe the lens, inadvertently the Stone made a free fall into the sink....Yikes!  Bottomline, I would not recommend this to anyone. I wish I can get my money back....What a waste.",2
"Initially, I was thrilled with my Jabra Stone (bought one for my wife as well) but the thrill diminished with time as I continually had trouble keeping it from sliding out of my ear when in use. If in the middle of conversation when this happened, I had to become a one handed driver. I tried every ear plug provided and could not find one that worked well.More recently, my device has died. I am not sure if it is the charger or the earpiece. I have given up and have moved on to another device made by a competitor.",2
This is is probably the best cell phone holster that I have purchased. Well constructed and easy to get the phone in and out.,5
"that it would not fit a phone that has a case on it. I would have thought that it had some wiggle room - nope - but if you are ok without protecting your phone, go for it, it fits the phoen snug. If you have a case, find something else.",3
"Awesome, perfect fit and phone sits very secured and never falls out. Very snug fit and locks in perfectly the 360 degree turn allows for positioning when sitting or standing",5
The phone case was pretty good. I gave it as a gift and the person really likes it. I may buy another.,5
"Compact, easy to use. There is no shell for the iPhone, it just snaps into the holster. The clip grips well and I've not had a problem with it coming loose.",4
I did not receive them yet but I hope I could use it to plug my nose hair with my electric nose hair plugger,5
"does what is supposed to do, did not liked coiled cable, it pulls my phone when moving in car and drops it.",4
good item def came in handy for my dad who stays on the road and needs a charger def recommended,5
It works. It's small enough that it store easily in the car. I bought it as an extra to take with me for the rental cars. I put orange masking tape on it so I don't overlook it when I return my rental cars. It's big enough for the tape and small enough for easy transportation.,5
This product is exactly as described it does what it is supposed to do and I'm very pleased with it you cannot go wrong for the price so buy one for your phone today at a good price.,5
Such s great product. Spirals for longer cord if needed. Works with any phone basically aside from iPhone. I love it!!,5
I bought this phone charger on amazon & it workd great. I got it for a really great price & I didnt have to spend alot of money for a phone charger.,5
and then better so far a year later still works like new. havent had any problems with this car charger very pleased. i recommend it if your looking for a low cost car charger.,5
I ordered this case and it came broken. Got an other one and it was broken in more pieces. So be careful. The post office is not and its not shipped in a protected package.,1
I play basketball so this case was just for the looks and I still have it and still in good condition. For all the hoopers it's a must get!,5
This  is a great case for my son's Iphone 4.  It was a great price and shipping was a little faster than estimate. Case covers the entire back and sides of phone.,5
"By looking at the picture I thought this case was rubber such as a real basketball, read the reviews but none said if it was, it's a hard plastic with the details of a real basketball. Unfortunately the color started fading off from using it one day.",4
Got that for my brother in law he liked it and I'm glad it was a good price for it for him,5
"I bought this for my boyfriend, and he loves the case but the front design and the back design don't line up. If you are looking at the phone from the side, you can tell that this wasn't printed correctly. It's not too noticeable, and he still uses it and loves it! The cover fits the phone well and all the buttons are accessible, but the design doesn't align correctly on the sides.",3
Unfortunately it arrived damaged and had to send it back. Not sure if it would have listed if it had come one piece or not.,1
"I love this phone case.The design is to die for.A lot of people ask where I bought it, and they love it.",5
"Love my new case. It is really Cute!! Be careful though, i found it to be a little slick. Wasnt payin attention and my phone slipped right out of my hands. Freinds really like it lol. And for the price cant beat it.",4
"It's a great cable, especially for the price. I haven't had any trouble at all, and both cords I purchased seem to work perfectly.",5
"it's not the best cable out there, but it does what is has to do, charging takes longer, maybe cause it's skinny? i bought this because i lost my HTC cable, but found it. i can't tell you to buy it or not go off what i said.",4
"These cables are a crap shoot. I ordered one about 3 months, and was extremely pleased. It charged my phone as well as transferred data.I just ordered four more to leave in various locations. The cable that I got looked completely different than the first cable that I received. The only reason that this concerned me was it shows that the seller either switched suppliers or multi-sources under the same part number. I plugged the cable into my phone. The charging light illuminates, but does not charge. I left my phone overnight and it died on the cable plugged into a laptop. I have since tried several other USB ports. None have changed the issue. Data is transferred to and from the phone.I wound up cutting apart one of the cables. It looks like pin 4, the ID pin, is not tied to ground via a resistor or directly. I cannot find much on the subject, but my guess is that the EVO requires this pin tied to something to allow charging.7/12/11I was contacted by the seller, refunded, and told that the issue was resolved.",1
"This cable is okay, you get what you pay for but it didn't last very long, I remember it broke after a month of use.",2
"Blew out in 3 weeks and is now utterly useless.  Looked good enough when package arrived however, the durability was nonexistent.",1
"This case is a little hard to get on and off. It gets 3 stars because the quality is not great (a few drops on a hard floor would break the clasps that keep it together) and it doesn't look sleek enough to make up for that. It was a little bit cloudy, too. That being said, nothing about this product makes it a bad purchase - it's simply not the best.",3
"This has the partial front which covers the earphone area and button and the full back. It came with front and back screen protectors which was nice. This came from Hong Kong, so it took a LONG time to get here. (2 1/2 weeks) Worth the wait, this is a VERY nice case, which my son stole immediately. It's clear, so he can show off his white iPhone. It's HARD to get off, it took the 2 of us to pry it off my phone, but it went right on his and locked securely.",5
"Protected my iPhone from immeasurable drops! Until I took the case off and my best friend sat on it while I was cleaning my iPhone...Little difficult to take off, led to some gross marks when I used a screwdriver, but very durable.",5
"I bought two of these so I could DIY some cases on my own. They work. They fit, they're clear, they cover the phone...so five stars.",5
VERY GREAT PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY VERY NICE AND CLEAR AND USEFUL AND A GOOD PRICE FOR THE PRODUCT! BUY IT IF YA WANTS A CLEAR CASE,5
"For the price its alright. It came with scratches. If you use it on a white iphone, you really cant see the scratches. On a black iphone all u see is scratches. So the inside is sharp. I could see it scracthing your metal band.For the price though, its not that bad.  That being said I never use it.",3
"This is a great case and low price case, the only thing the back opening is very small, with flash the pictures are bad.",5
"Ordered 2, one for my wife's iPhone 4S and one for mine. It fits fine, but the plastic is so cheap that it looks great on day 1 but by day 5 looks scratched up just from normal use. Definitely provides no protection for iPhone, if anything it makes the iPhone more slippery when pulling it out of the pocket and bag and more susceptible to falls.The seller took 10 days to ship it and it came in a padded USPS envelope rather than a hard envelope, and as a result, was cracked and secondly, they shipped only 1 vs 2 that I ordered. After contacting them and waiting for 3 days they finally responded and said they would correct it. Another 10 days later only 1 came in the mail packaged the same way. No replacement for the broken one. Called them about return and no response. It was not even worth my time to deal with it, so I threw them both in the garbage and got bodyglove ones for us.",1
"Looks good, feels good, and makes my mums white iPhone look stellar.This was the exact case she was looking for and it fits snugly and feels good in her hand.Excellent case for the money.",4
The case isn't this BIG case that makes my iPhone look HUGE! It's simple and looks elegant :)(I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE WORDS AMAZON).,5
"Yesterday I wrote a review about the product and also emailed the seller with my issues. Received an email when I woke this morning to find they refunded my money to compensate me for the trouble. Though I didn't like the product that much because it didn't look like the picture, they were quick to find a resolution. I appreciate that they did that. so I would in the future buy from them again.",5
"The material's quality is exactly equivalent to what you pay for. But!!! Of course you wont buy this particular type of case to 'protect' your phone, if you get this get it to show off, not to protect it. Its so thin you barely tell is a case, the clear sides makes it even better because you really can't tell theres a case on the phone.I've got a black iphone and as long as its facing downward you'd say its a white one. I'll order some other colors and im confident they'll look as cool as this one.PS: I ordered this product on Oct/27  it was supposed to arrive by Nov/23 but it got to me (via Hong-Kong > USPS) by Nov/10",5
"great fit, good protective case, daughter added scrapbook paper under it for a cute look and it protects phone nicely",5
it was ok my nieces used it to make a home made case and it broke quickly. the front case prongs broke. was able to use for a few months,3
hard to push buttons but nice case.,3
Good for the price and for what I needed it for.  The home button is a &#34;U&#34; shape however.  I like the clear cases with the home button &#34;hole&#34; instead.,3
"This a great phone case for someone who wants their phone protected but doesn't like flashy cases. It's two pieces, front and back, and is easy to apply, but harder to remove. It came packed with great care and is pretty good quality. Definitely worth the great price!",5
THE CASE YOU ARE PURCHASING IS NOT THE CASE YOU RECEIVE DO NOT BUY. THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING AND WASTE OF MONEY!!!,1
This case was alright. The fit was fine but you can easily see the dirtiness on it. I want buy a case like this again. I am sure because its clear are the reason you can see when it get dirty. I should have thought about that before I brought it. But a great fit.,3
"I bought this item for my wife and she doesn't even use it. I thought it was the hard plastic jewell case but it turned out to be a more flexible plastic. It did arrive on time and in new condition as guranteed by the vendor although, it didn't have any packaging but more like an envelope with bubble wrap. It wasn't what I expected but the price was unbeatable...",3
"After a series of poor-quality cases purchased at the Verizon store, I picked this unit up.I wanted something that would protect the phone from a slight fall, but not be so thick as to keep it from being used with a belt pouch.  This is the case....it's high quality, nicely covered with a leather-like substance, and provides a full hard plastic cover for the vulnerable sides and back of the phone.I liked it so much that when I wore out the first one (I pull the phone in and out of the pouch a lot), I purchased two more....one to use, another as a spare.Good product!",5
"This case if purely for fashion and not for practicality. Don't expect this case to stay on after you dropped your phone. I've had two of these and neither one of them has managed to protect my phone from any damage. The leather case is a nice little fashion accessory and the stand, which is almost impossible to open for the first time, is perfect for watching videos on those lazy days when you just don't feel like holding your phone. Overall this was what I wanted, but wouldn't mind a case that doesn't snap apart every drop.",4
"The 'leather' coating feels like nothing more than hard plastic.  And, the kickstand is a bear to get out (I have to use an ink pen or something similar to pop it out -- it's so difficult to do that you're liable to break a nail).  Having said all that, it's a solid, hard plastic case with a leather look. Somewhat slippery to hold though.  And, once you get the kickstand actually out, it's pretty cool.Update:  Now that I've had the case on my Droid X for a bit, here are a couple more observations:  It actually begins to have more of a slight 'leather feel' the longer I've used it.  The kickstand is worthless when charging, as it is on the same side as the mini USB port, rendering it unusable for that purpose.  Looks good on the X, but beginning to wonder now how much I'll actually use the kickstand.",3
"The Amzer Limited Edition Elite Leather Snap On Hard Case is an exact clone of the case Verizon sells at its stores for $25. I've bought a couple of different style cases for my Droid X, and so far this one is the one I like most. It fits very well, even with the BH6X extended battery. It's not bulky, and weighs little. It's far from perfect though. The case is actually a plastic shell, with a thin leather skin glued onto it. I have my doubts that it will hold up for a long period of time. The kickstand while useful, is next to impossible to open without excessive force. It also rattles when closed, which annoys me. Phone protection is probably minimal too. For now it's my case of choice, but I'll keep looking for something better.Edit: I have to change my opinion on the protection the case provides. Yesterday, I accidentally dropped my phone on a concrete sidewalk. The phone hit on its top corner. Although there's a good sized gash in the case, the phone survived without a scratch. I'm pretty impressed now.",4
"This is a good protective case for the droid x. Works great love the kick stand, but wish it was on the other side of the phone thats why it only gets 4 stars.",4
"I bought one of these at the Verizon store and used it for a month. I wanted to switch to a case with a holster. When I took the Droid X out of this case, the sides of the droid had dozens of small scratches and places where the finish was scuffed off. I assume this is from dust and pocket grit getting in the case and rubbing between the phone and the case.",2
"The cover fits well and looks great to me.  Mine looks and feels like leather.  I agree the kick-stand is hard to open but I took a nailfile and filed the tab down some so it is much easier to use.  However, with the cable attached it is useless.  The cover snapped on just fine but I'm not sure I can get it off without destroying it.  It locks together real tight.  I would like to take it off from time to time to clean accumulated dust and dirt from it.  All in all I am very happy with the case as I just drop it in my pocket and don't like to use a holster.",4
"I'm surprised anyone would not give this 5 stars. I actually paid twenty dollars for this a few months ago. The texture is like hard leather- like a shoe- but textured. I have dropped my phone several times on concrete and no scratches on my phone. The case did snap off once, but only after being dropped. The only negative thing I can find about this is that it is difficult to remove if you need to pull the battery. However, that's my phone's fault. There should be no reason for me to pull the battery, but it freezes occasionally, and therefore need to pull the battery. I don't have a problem pulling out the kickstand. It is firm but I'm able to pop it out with fake nails as well as my soft real nails. The case looks nice, they kickstand is extremely useful when watching a youtube video or playing chess :)Update: After a couple of months and another few drops, one of the side tabs broke. It won't snap shut anymore. I went back to my old case that was a bejeweled case that attracted lint like crazy, and am now on the search for another. Yet here I am...eyeing this case again...the only one with a slim kickstand. The other commentor was right when he said the kickstand shouldve been on the other side; you can't charge the phone and use the kickstand simultaneously. Other than that, I'm thinking of buying it again. It protected my phone from several drops, and therefore worth it.",5
I received this item and snapped it around my Droid X and was instantly happy.  It protected the phone as I wanted it to and gave it a nice look.  It also feels good when I hold the phone.  The easel is great.  I can watch videos or read email while siting at a table or desk.  I don't like the silicone covers.  They tend to feel slimy and the phone will still slip out of my hand when my hand gets a little sweaty.  I highly recommend it!,5
"I just don't get the negative reviews of this case.  What are folks expecting?  Good grief.  It's a two-piece hard shell lined with leather.  Works great and feels nice.  Every access point to the device is open and it does protect it as much as any other stupid case would.  And for so cheap, it baffles me that people want total immunity from their peculiar challenges.  Just get it already...",5
"I bought this along with theSamsung Note2 Stand and Spare Battery Charger (3100mAh Battery Included)so that I could charge both the battery and the phone at the same time. If I plug one end into the spare battery charger only, then the charger works beautifully, but when I plug the other end into the phone, then the battery charger light flashes to indicate that it has stopped charging. It may work fine for other uses, but if you have the Samsung Note2 and battery charger, you'll need dedicated cords for the battery charger and the phone if you want to charge them both at the same time.",2
Just what I needed.  I have a spare battery charger and with this I can charge my spare battery and my phone at the same time. Its awesome,5
I was able to split my micro usb power wire to two devices. Was so useful when i was travelling this winter. whats not to like&#62;?,5
Excellent cable for my SIII is that in my country costs a lot to get something for this phone and the quality is very good I can charge the battery and the phone too.,5
I have 2 phones and one of them has a very bad battery life so I am always having to have it on the charger so I got this so I can always be charging my one phone and also charge my new one when need be. I would recommend this to other people.,5
I got this so I would not have so many charger connected to the outlets.  I tried to use this charging my Samsung Note 2 and Motorola Photon.  Well the Motorola Photon would not charge when connected.  I have tried to use it to charge my two extra batteries charger and it will not work with them either.  So I either have a defective splitter or it just does not work.  I can not charge two phones or battery chargers.  I tried to charge both my Samsung Note 2's and it will only charge one of them.,1
"This is a great product, cost is very low, this will help you to do more with your tablet or phone if you need  it for charging or whatever it help me a lot.",5
Don't buy it! It's bulky & it doesn't work! Anyone can see your conversation at any direction! I would not recommend this screen protector to anyone!,1
The screen is ok. Not exactly what I expected for the price. Not entirely sure if it was worth it or not.,4
"I had a privacy screen already but it got messed up so I order a new one. Surprisingly this time when I order it, it is not a privacy screen, it can still show what my display is on the side. it only faded my screen which I can do by lowering the brightness. I am disappointed that I did not get what I ordered before. The first one had ridges that block people from looking on the side but not this one I received. Oh well I'll probably look somewhere else. Once again it does not even block others from seeing your screen, just makes it tinted.",2
"This is a 2-way privacy screen protector (left and right angles).Pros:Perfect cutProvides left and right angles for privacyVery sturdy and solid screen protectorCons:Too Thick (screen becomes less responsive to touch)Small Diagonal lines across screenSeems to lower resolutionProne to small fine scratchesI've had this for a few days and for the most part, it sits in my pocket when I go out.  I never put anything else in the pocket with my iphone and the screen already picked up some scratches.  The BIGGEST issue is the thickness of the screen protector.  I know it may be necessary to be this thick to provide privacy, but sometimes my screen doesn't respond to my touch!  It can get very annoying trying to swipe over and over again.I would not recommend this product unless you absolutely MUST have privacy.",3
"I love this screen protector.Just know, these are thick, and if you have an Otterbox defender case I would suggest popping the built on plastic off from your case so the touch will work better.They also make the screen a tiny big pixelated and darker, but it does work for if you don't want someone peeping at your screen.",3
After having the screen protector on for a few days the top layer started to peel off. Was not satisfied,1
"I had already purchased one in the past, that's why I got another one. The first one was very good, but I was very disappointed with the second one. After only a week, it started peeling off and it really doesn't give privacy.  I liked the first one better",2
Looks cool on phone. Makes phone look very modern and slik.  I like how it protects iphone from getting scatched.,5
"Does work but you'll have to turn up the brightness somewhat to see whats on the screen, privacy is good though.",3
"it's the worst screen saver ever  it just hits you when i placed it on , as if i'm watching my screen behind a zibra ??? allot of diagonal lines that makes seeing the screen from the front imposible , privacy should make it hard for non direct viewer i know cause i've had alot but this is a scam , it can't be in anyway a genuine ax it's horrible",1
For the cost for this hard cover iphone case it definitely is worth it. It isnt the best quality but it works and looks nice.,4
"I really loved the case. The color was very beautiful, and I really enjoyed the colors that came with it. VERY NICE.",5
IT WAS PRETTY BUT AFTER A WHILE (AS WITH MOST WHITE CASES) IT STARTED TO GET BROWN FROM ALL THE HANDLING. PRETTY CASE THO AND CAME QUICKLY.,2
"I ordered this phone cover to protect my phone and to add to it's look as well. I read some other reviews that stated it was impossible to remove without breaking it which isn't true but I did have to take a nail file and pry it open,leaving a little gouge mark on that side. There should be few reasons to remove it unless you want to change it so be sure to out in your screen protectors first. But really,it is so inexpensive, I wouldn't mind replacing it if I had to. It snaps together snugly and seems to protect adequately. Have dropped phone once or twice with no ill effects. Very good quality for not much money!!!",4
I gave this as a gift and it was appreciated when given. I like mine so thought they would like one too.,3
this is really pretty! i love the white with the pink flowers i used this one a lot with my iphone4,5
This case arrived really early. I didn't know what to expect when I opened the package because I have received some bad cases in the past. This case is BEAUTIFUL. It has a nice smooth feel and it fits nicely on my phone. Yeah! Finally. This case is really different from any case that I have tried in the past. Please try it. You've gotta. This is not a sales pitch. But i'm saying this because these cases are the best things ever and everyone wants a good soft case.,5
broke the first time I try to change it. wasn't made very will. very thin plastic. just threw it away,1
"This is truly a Lovely Case at an inexpensive price. However I don't recommend it since after a few days of use it RUINED my iPhone! It scratched the corners of my screen.Edit 05/23/2013Just wanted to add that although this case scratched the corners of my iPhone 4. Even though I kept it in my junk drawer for a while it never lost it's beautiful flower designs or color. So after my iPhone 5 purchase I put my iPhone 4 back in this case, since I only use this phone now for playing my Story games. The case still looks like brand new so I'm giving it now 3 stars from 1 lol.",3
For an inexpensive case this one worked great. Fit the phone perfectly and was easy to put on. It also didn't let in debris inbetween it and the phone.,5
This item arrived cracked and would not snap on to the phone and stay.  It was not worth the cost of postage to return it.,1
"Soft, feminine, pretty looking case. A few different shades of pink, with small golden bees - again, very soft, feminine and pretty.  Nice hard case that fits iPhone 4 perfectly. Looks good on ugly white iPhone. I'm happy with the purchase.",5
"The product look exactly like in the picture. It provides a good grip, fits easily in my jeans pockets and looks good on my white i phone. I dropped it twice from a height of 2 and a half feet and it dint crack and held up well, the phone was not damaged either. The edges got a little dirty white over time but thats a given when you use a white cover often I guess. On the whole happy with the purchase and love the price.",5
"It's fine, but not as sturdy as I'd have liked. I have a similar one by Encase which is much better...but also more expensive. I guess for the price this isn't bad at all.",3
"I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this protection due to the bad reviews it had! I got it an it is a perfect fit, all my expectations were met! does not slide out as many others posted on their reviews.  Definitely recommend for all those ipad (first generation owners).",5
"This thing is awesome, all leather and provides a lot of protection for my iPad. I just wish that there was a small slot on the inside of the cover so that I could put my microfiber cloth in there. Other then that the iPad is very secure inside and I never once thought it was going to fall out.Compared to iPad cases that cost just a few dollars less, this is SO WORTH THE MONEY!!",5
"Looks Cheap, but appears to do the job. Very nice holds the product in place. The stand I like as these i pads are to heavy for the other kick stand idea, so this worked out just fine. Not too much pressure for the stand. I was a bit confused as to how to make it stand up, but turned out to be pretty simple,",5
i bought this for my iPad original and i gotta say i was a little hessadent on buying it because the price was so low and now that i have it i know that i made the right decision. the iPad itself is very secure with a snug fitting case and a security flap that tucks in the front. overall no drop protection but it is stylish and protects against scratches.,4
"If I had paid $40 for this, I would say it's an average case, but for $7.08 including 2 day shipping I have absolutely nothing substantial to complain about.  I doubt very much that this iPad was specifically designed for a Gen 1 ipad given the front camera hole in the case, but it fits snugly and overall is a decent sturdy case.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase a similar product for our mini iPad when needed.",5
"Elan Folio for Ipad Black- Considerably less expensive than the MSRP - great $$$ savings- high quality item- solid and very protective construction- should provide years of use, while protecting, and looking great- strongly recommended",5
&#34;It's to bulky!&#34; according to my kids who use it.  It [the iPad] tends to slip out of the case so the kids would prefer not to have it on the iPad at all.  But it does work okay.  We had to put duct tape on the tabs that have it stand up because they weren't working.,2
"I have an ipad first gen, and this folio thing fits it okay. Not perfectly, and if I set it up on its side, the tablet kinda slides down in the holder, so it's not as snug a fit as I would like.The tabs on the back that you tuck the front cover into in order to set this up on its side? Yeah, those tabs are really stiff and firm, so it's hard to put the ipad up in &#34;stand&#34; mode.The folder itself is of reasonably good quality material with good stitching. It will hold up to abuse for some time, I predict, and it didn't even have a funky smell or anything to it, as far as I could tell. It doesn't hold closed with magnets or velcro or anything, which is a bit of a bummer, but i may just get some hook-and-loop closures to make it do that.  At the price this thing cost, I'm pretty okay with it not working perfectly.If you want a very basic folder-cover for your ipad first gen, this will serve just fine.",4
This is a really good protective case that protect the entire iPad. The only problem is the flap that keeps the iPad in place is too loose. The iPad tends to slide down if I have it standing sideways. The way the front folding part is made with the edges makes a lot of possible positions of comfort no matter how I'm lying down or sitting.,4
Works good helps with protection only thins is its hides out very slowly u won't notice until you go to press the home button,4
I think for the price this is a great buy. I am glad it was available even though it is for the old ipad.,5
"most ipad users will want pad 3 or 4 pretty soon due to cameras,retina display,facetime,& other features.this product is not costly and will solidly protect yourpad1 which is great for email,music,videos,etc.it is a good choice for what u need.",4
looks nice and fits perfectly.  It does what it does very well.  I would buy another Elan Folio for Ipad in Black.,5
"For me, this was the perfect case. It protected my iPad as it should and wasn't too bulky at all. I've even dropped it a few times and it was completely protected. If you still have the original iPad, I would recommend this case. It's basic black and not too fancy.",5
"Excellent build quality, too bad it just doesn't function very well. The &#34;stand&#34; position constantly collapses and doesn't stay in place for very long. There is also very little flexibility since this is basically a one-position stand. The buttons are hard to access  just because of the thick construction around the access points.",1
"These are not worth the amount i paid. literally it does nothing,it is not sturdy enough to stand up your ipad, kick stand style, its beneficial if you plan to hold your ipad all the time or lay it flat on its back.",3
i bought a used ipad for a friend and had a terrible time trying to find a case and then i stumbled upon this one which was PERFECT! it was EXACTLY what was wanted and i had been looking for! protective AND functional and VERY quick shipping!!!!,5
"Get the Elan Passport Folio instead! It's better than this one but a bit more expensive.[...]I ordered this for about $7 shipped. It's a good case, of course it's not real leather but it's so good it's hard to tell.It does a good job of protecting the back but there are some hard plastic parts that might scratch your tablet if the folio is badly made. I have no problems with that on mine.However it's been a week and some stitching has already started to give and come loose. Not so happy about that. But it's in areas that are not as reinforced and not important areas, so it's good but it would be perfect if it weren't breaking on me...There's also nothing to keep the case shut, so it will open if you just hold it wrong. I wish it had magnets or a strap like it's brother. The Passport has a strap to keep the cover closed and not flopping around.Also to make it stand, it requires two hands. Not really easy, takes a little bit of effort, got to use both hands to ply up the folds and put cover in to make it stand. Would have been better if it were easier and a one hand job instead of 2.But for a few bucks, it's a cheap investment to protect your expensive purchase.",3
Love it! It is perfect for holding my iphone when Im cruising around on my beach cruiser listening to my music! Perfect!,5
Made for a Bicycle mainly.  Too weak for a motorcycle and my phone would drop.  Should say that on the description.,2
"I thought I was going to need to supplement this with velcro just to be sure I didn't lose my phone, but this things holds it tight. I am very pleased!",4
"I wouldn't trust just this to hold your fragile mobile device in since you can hit a lot of bumps and corners on your bike. I honestly haven't used it more than a couple of times because I didn't feel good about its safety. The few times I did use it I strapped it in better with some rubberbands. Since it's very sunny outside when I ride I can hardly see my screen anyway, I feel safer with my mobile device in my pocket.",3
"I've had about 4 rides with my iPhone, in Otterbox Defender, very securely held by this device, over pavement and on the beach. I've gone over uneven surfaces with no problems. Deducting a star because, as suggested by another reviewer, I'm using a fat rubber band to further secure the phone to the device.",4
"The moment this arrived I put it on my bike in all but 5 mintues then I and hit the road for a test ride. 2 long screws secures the base to my handlebar.The base mount separates from the top 360 degree swivel; and the phone sits on a soft foam rubber pad, there are three sides that clamps (also rubber padded) on and locks around the phone adequately.  I'm going to try the rubber band trick,The price fit my budget and it arrived just a few days after I ordered it.",4
"I bought this to use with my Droid Incredible and I also bought the OtterBox Defender case to go with it (OtterBox Defender-Series Shield for the HTC DROID Incredible (Black)).  The mount works great while I have the OtterBox on it...touchscreen works great, holds it securely, and I feel pretty comfortable with it on my bike.  Would probably but a rubber band or two around it if I was going on heavy off-road, but for light trails it holds it well and I trust the OtterBox to help keep it safe.It does NOT work well for a Droid Incredible with NO case.  It does not hold it tight enough on its tightest setting...so you must have a case on an Incredible to use with this mount.UPDATE 6/24/11: I recently bought a Thunderbolt and it fits fine without a case...holds it securely.  However, I think I would still put a rugged case on it if I was doing anything extreme ;-)",4
"I love my HTC  Evo, but battery life is an issue. I recently spent time on vacation, without charger or WiFi, and the battery rarely lasted the day. This charger comes to the rescue. Now I can have an extra battery charged and just pop it in if I run low. The battery charger also has a USB port so that I can charge the battery in the phone while charging the spare.",5
this battery charger is awesome I always have a spare battery fully charged whenever I need it and It saved me so much money from going down to buy it for some retail store that marks it up  about 500%.,5
"Unlike all the rest of the chargers, I feel great about this purchase.  In the past I always had to have a backup charger because they fall apart and this one puts the rest to shame.  I am confident this will beat the.routine of opening a new charger every few weeks.  Yay!",5
This is the perfect little gadget for people who always carry around a spare battery. I actually bought this for a friend and am a bit disappointed I was unable to find one for the Droid X.,5
The extra battery work great at the time but I've moved on to a bigger and better phone. It's something I might do again.,5
"I have placed several batteries into this contraption many times, on many different outlets and for many many hours and this thing doesn't freakin charge the freakin battery. I want my money back!Not only that, if you hook your phone up to this via usb, IT WILL FRY YOUR PHONE! My Evo 4g becomes unresponsive while plugged into this peace of crap! But it works fine when I take it out of this junk.But when I hook my evo up to other chargers and even computers, it works perfect and charges perfect. Please give me back my money!!!",1
Worked well when I couldn't plug my cord into my phone. I was pleased with this product and would use it again.,5
"This is one of the few chargers that can charge hi-capacity batteries, so that's definitely a plus.  It has fully charged every battery I've tried with it (OEM HTC EVO 4G battery, a cheap knock-off from here, and the Sprint hi-capacity battery), and it never took more than overnight to do so.  The indicator light even turned green when it was fully charged, and I've never noticed any overcharging at all, so I suspect it's turning off the charger when the battery is fully charged - something I was unsure if it'd actually do, given the price.I haven't tried the USB output, though, so I can't speak to how well that works or if it impacts the charging rate.In the end, if you carry a spare battery, this is an incredibly useful device to have for keeping the spare charged.",5
"I received the cell phone, but not arrived the Micro SD of 2GB.Could you help me, please as soon as possible?I await of your prompt responseAtte.Andres Oyola Garcia",3
"This is a very complete design, it have everything wifi, bluetooth and a very good 3G conectivity. The battery it's very good and it's a very strong design.",4
"I just received this phone today. I purchased it though a 'lightening deal' on Amazon.com over Christmas.  My reasons for purchasing this phone were two-fold. #1, I have a really old flip Samsung phone.  I have a prepaid plan with T-Mobile where I only pay $100 per year, and I always have 'leftover' minutes as I only use my cell phone for an emergency, so I wanted to 'update' my phone.  #2, I wanted to be able to use it when I go to Europe by simply using a different SIM card.I do not have a data plan, as I'm on a prepaid plan.  But the phone is supposed to have WiFi.  Note 'supposed to'.  I have an iPod Touch, which works GREAT on WiFi.  I was thinking that this phone would be similar to that. . . That I could use many of the features through WiFi.  That doesn't really work so well.Let me just go ahead and list all the horrible things about this phone. . . .* WiFi - It's a nightmare.  I have yet to find a way to tell it to connect to WiFi at my house and leave it on all the time.  There is no 'simple' way. . . that I have found. . . to connect to WiFi.  When you try and connect it will then ask you 'what you want to do with it' or 'how you want to connect'.  JUST CONNECT AND BE DONE WITH IT!  If you chose the wrong 'option' then it just doesn't connect at all.* I can't tell if WiFi is working or not.* Even if you know that WiFi is connected, when you try and do certain things, it will still try connecting through cell service. . . which it can't do, because I don't have a data plan, so you just receive an error.* The 'operating system' this phone uses is supposed to be used by more phones around the world than any other system. . . but. . . there is a reason why it's not used in the U.S. . . . IT STINKS!  On top of this, I recently read that even Nokia is going to stop using it and change to Windows!!!  Listen!  You REALLY want either an iPhone or an Android phone.  Something that is EASY and USER-FRIENDLY to use.  This operating system is NOT easy to use and STINKS!* How many apps are there for this phone?  I don't know. . . perhaps three?  Perhaps not even that many.  You're 'slumming' with this phone. . .* It's a pain to take the back panel off.  You have to press-in two buttons, but even then the panel does not pop-open.* If you want to open the USB port, you have to take something and 'gouge' it open.* No touchscreen* As a man with 'normal' fingers, the keypad is not great.  But then I've never seen one that really was on a phone this size.  Everyone wants tiny phones. . . but then the keys are also tiny.* Have I mentioned that NOTHING is easy about this phone??  It's an entire process you have to go through to do anything on this phone.There is only ONE good thing about this phone.  It looks good.  But otherwise . . . it STINKS!!There is really only one reason that I will probably keep this phone. . . .and it's a really bad reason to keep it. . . but. . . there is a camera on the phone.  My old phone doesn't have a camera, and my old phone is not going to last forever.  So. . .  I'll use this piece-of-junk for just a phone. . . and the camera ability.  Again, fortunately I got it as a 'lightening deal'.  Otherwise I would be returning it.PLEASE do yourself a favor and get an iPhone if you can. .  .if not. . . get an Android phone.  I think you'll be MUCH happier.  Again, even Nokia is not using this garbage operating system for their new phones.",1
"I love Nokia phones, and this is one of the best. i am not a person to text and drive or talk and drive. to many bad cincy drivers to not pay attention all the time.easy to use, easy to set up, Wifi",5
"This is a good product, very intuitive and by all means, the best in battery endurance. The screen is rather small and hence sometimes difficult to read. In any case, I would very much recommend it to anyone nor looking for something out of this world, operation is simple, sound is perfect and price is good.",4
"I own this same phone for over a year now, can say i have any issues with it. still works great even after i have drop it a dozen times. Also its very fast enough to check my mail, use it as a music player. best part battery last very long even up to know, i get around 3 to 5 days battery life. like that i can just quickly pull phone out of my pocket press space bar and bam the flash  light is on. takes great pictures at night for a camera phone not made to take professional pictures lol and  not far at night either.i Use Opera to browse the internet much faster.and palringo for all my chat services.would recommend.",5
"I migrated from Nokia E71, the best smartphone I have ever had so my review is compared to it.PROS:Great 680Mhz processor speed and multitasking.The QWERTY keyboard is a litle wider whitch is easier to type and it has better key distribution.Better menu organization.Faster WI-FI navigation.Easy Email setupGreat 5MP cameraGreat designInternal memory is 256MbExternal memory support up to 32GbExcelent video and sound playbackExcellent quality/price ratio.CONS (What I miss from Nokia E71):Hard plastic body compared to robust metal body of Nokia E71The TFT screen is hard to read at direct sunlightThe external memory is under the batteryThe volume button is TOO HARD.Overall the Nokia E5 is an excelent phone for the price I am very satisfied with it even I miss the points mentioned from the Nokia E71 (Reason I rated it with 4 stars)",4
i loved this phone the only downfall is the memory ..... i would have kept this phone but it was unlocked therefor when i did the soft reset i lost my unlock status and all my info boooo lol but graet phone pixs an all i loved it...,5
"This is a good example of why Nokia is losing market share. If you are use to their convolted user interface and way of doing things then it's ok. Everything works for the most part. The web browser and other web app sucks compared to the other phones. Compared to it's chief rival Blackberry...the BB OS 6 is way better in every respect.  Can't imagine a single reason I would get this phone over an iPhone, Andriod, or BB and I have owned and used all of them.",3
"I have owned and loved Nokia phones forever it seems. After my N8 purchase, I was tired of many bugs, and mad at Nokia for waiting ages for Anna update to see it later fail every installation with useless help from their technical support - I had to install all components manually based on Nokia blog tips. However, My wife's old Nokia 5800 died and she wanted a new phone. Since I only buy unlocked phones (we use them a lot overseas with different SIM cards) I did not have too many inexpensive choices. She needed a phone that would give her GPS, free maps and voice guidance without data access, and for than Nokias are the only game in town. When she got this phone something was not installed properly and her contacts would not even start up. After a lot of struggle I decided to do a hard reset (not a soft factory reset, which did not work) and it started working fine. Since then she has loved it. She does a lot of texting and keyboard works great for her (I hate it). She likes the white version that sets it apart from all the blackberries.  I take one star off for getting brand new phone with one of the main apps not starting up.",4
"Worked right out of the box with AT&T;, both with the pay-as-you go internet on my phone and the $15/month unlimited plan on my wife's.The phone is nice.  Great screen (albeit small compared to the I-Phone for example) and reasonably fast speed.  Many of the menus are not as logical as other Nokia phones, and so much time is spent with trial-and-error figuring out where things are.  My wife misses her 'happy monkey' dynamic wallpaper from her 6700 classic, which shows him with a full belly when charged etc, in fact I haven't found any dynamic wallpaper at all yet (but I'm still working on it!)The OVI software is sort of a dumbed-down version of PC Suite, which was simple and elegant - what were they thinking with OVI?  Nokia users - do drop Nokia a line about how bad OVI is!Battery life is pretty good, and much better I understand than the I-Phone.To me, it seems that the bottom line on this phone is that it's really nice if sending/receiving emails are a priority (because typing is easier with a keyboard than with a touch-screen) and media is secondary.  If you primarily use the phone for surfing and media playback, the the I-Phone or Android is a better choice (I-Phone if you like to be locked in to a carrier!)",4
"I bought this mobile for my sis back home and she loves it. All her friends love it too. The fact that its such a light weight, easy qwerty keyboard (big enough to punch effortlessly), nice quality make (not cheap plastic) and got pretty much all the features a business woman needs in a mobile. Quite satisfied with it.",5
"if you need a simple and durable basic function phone, i would highly recommend this product. its got tough internal and external hardware for heavy users.",5

"First, you're wrong and I know you never spoke to Verizon.  I have more times than you need know. Let me tell you that verizon isn't also the problem.  If it is, tell me how?  You can't.  But I knew that.  You're being disrespectful to fact. even if I don't know this person and can't endorse him as a seller myself I can prove to you I sell unlocked phones of this and the 9650 around world.  Anyone else here has no idea what they're talking about.  Why not read up, and get some information so I can explain if you want to further bash this.  But it's only so that you'll know that you need to stop being ignorant about facts, lying, and also slandering.  If you're able to I'll gladly tell you how I can prove you wrong and hope you can learn from this.",4
"First off,just to be fair,I did not buy my phone from Amazon but direct from Verizon nearly 2 1/2 years ago,along with my wifes.NEVER had a problem with either phone,EVER,some people have had problems with the wheel freezing,in the years I have owned this,havent ever had that issue,nor my wife,and we use these ALOT,one of the first things I liked is that ALL Blackberry phones have PIN #'s so you can pin eachother at NO cost,nice little feature,not that it matters these days as pretty much everything is included in a contract.I actually,(about 2 years ago) purchased a FULL gold case for mine,thats full front incl keyboard and full back incl battery door just to look unique and it certainly does,coupled with the chrome hard case supplied by Verizon,looks great.Features of the phone are great RIM support is awesome too,only thing I ever noticed that was an irritant.....on occasion couldnt get calls or emails,so looking in Service Status it would show emergency only and no service on Blackberry!!!!Each time fixed by simply turning off connections then turning them on again fixed instantly,now this happened rarely but happened.Easy fix.Cant remember how many times I have dropped this phone and it still works fine,never broke the screen either,(most often was in the Blackberry holster,but not always),my point being,have had this phone ALONG time and is STILL going strong,bought a battery from Amazon ($5)other than that,nothing and still go days without re charging.Cant answer for refurbished phones as bought these new,and have been very impressed with them.Am not going to belabor the point and hope this review helps give an informed decision as reviews on ANY phone are checkered,we owned these phones a considerable amount of time and have both been issue free.Just an fyi,Blackbery tablets sync with these too via bluetooth and work fine.To me,this is a 5 star phone that has given me trouble free service,works seamlessly with my Jensen stand alone bluetooth in the car and seamlessly with my wifes phone(send videos to eachothers phone via bluetooth too)just a cool trouble free phone.ALSO,you can buy a new screen on its own,new wheel IF it stops working,cool outer case(not a protector case) as i didfor a few dollars and videos on youtube on how to install..............again,just options.......wheels are pretty much any color you want as are cases,gold,silver,chrome,blue,yellow,red etc.",5
"This smart phone is very good, because it suits my communication needs, is easy to use, you hear very well. My only problem is that the signal going into the house, only comes in some area. But I recommend it for its multiple functions and easy to program.",5
"As other reviewers say, this is not truly as pictured, as it is a Verizon phone. That said, it works pretty well -- with one major exception: where I am (in Tanzania) the data portion is not unlocked. The handset will not enable data access at all. The cel phone company rep here (Airtel)told me they have had this problem with many Verizon BBerries, and despite their request, RIM has not come back with a solution for unlocking the phones for data.And now Amazon won't let me return it as the 30 days are up. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. This is the first time I am very unhappy with my Amazon purchase.",1
"AWFULL I GOT THIS FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW, CUZ SHE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THOSE NEW PHONES, BUT GEEZ, THIS THING THAT SAYS UNLOCK WAS  LIKE REFURBISHED, AND DOESNT TAKE THE SIGNAL AS WELL, PIECE OF CRAP.",1
"Good team though at present fails to reach the receiver, I live far away so I had to repair on my own to avoid problems and the need for equipment for the job., Who brought the charger was not original and arrived damaged module ac / dc. It is not the first time I buy a phone like this however is the first sim that I get bad",2
This was a gift for someone who loves the Blackberry.  He was very happy and these old models are quite durable!,3
"I love this phone but I cant get access to the internet...maybe the props is the setting. It is a sprint product,i was scared its not gonna work with sim card but it did. I just pray that it will work perfectly in Nigeria. I hvnt send it yet. but I like it.",4
Easy to apply especially with tabs attached to surface telling you what to peel when. Nice slippery surface for your finger to glide on. No problems. Only need to be [very] careful when you apply these. You CAN mess them up if you don't do it slowly and carefully. Use the included cloth to clean phone surface first and the scraper to get bubbles out if you get any. Would buy again. (and it did - for other phones),5
The item was as described. I am completely satisfied. The protector does what it is supposed to. I would reccommend this product to anyone.,5
"After two months of waiting, we finally received the screen protector.  BUT it does not fit the DroidX.  It is way too small to cover the screen.  I guess if you order cheap, you get cheap.",1
This screen cover goes on easy and looks good.  My only issue with it is that it has a shiny surface and produces alot of glare.  I forgot to make sure what I was ordering had a satin finish to cut the glare.,3
This one works as expected and is worth the money than others you end up paying $10 or $20 - really not worth at all IMO...I screwed up the first one with air bubbles - totally my fault - I tried to take it out and reapply which didnt work since it picked up a lot of dust by that time - so I had to throw it...The next one I applied easily and without any air bubbles :),5
"These are top quality screen protectors, as god as the otterbox or seidio screen covers.  Much cheaper though, and you get 3!",5
it has a sticker that can not be remove. Even using GooGome is not the answer. I have given up on them,1
"Not sure of all of the problems.  Of course the 'sticky' side goes toward the screen.They take a bit to get them aligned because the tolerance in the cut is so perfect.  Probably less than 0.1 mm overall.Screen looks great, no bubbles whatsoever, and it only took a minute or two to smooth it out.  You just have to be sure there is NOTHING on the screen when you install it.  Wash your hands too.",5
"Fits my Droid X2 even though advertised for Droid X. Just have to be patient in installing, also have really steady hands. Ruined one but it's my fault since I've never installed one before.",4
"is not a flimsy saran-wrap product , but instead a firm protective shield that will stand straight up on it's own.  Easy to apply, and the air just comes out from under it on your own.  You don't want to spend a lot of money - esp on a product where you only get ONE protector. Get this - you get three protectors in case you mess one up.Does not interfere with the view, brightness, nor function of the touch screen on the Droid X2.Just GET THIS !",5
"These things are useless. Previous reviews mention that the screen protector is sandwiched between two pieces of plastic but there is no way to separate the protector from the second piece, if there is one. I tried and tried and it just kept peeling off the whole thing. Pure crap.",1
"First off, if you are in a rush you are gonna blow it BIIIG TIME BRO! These things rock. The clear sheet isn't quite the size of the screen on the X which is actually good in a way. I'm sure if they were exactly the size of the glass, it would be much more difficult to install. There's about an 16th of an inch gap if that. Make sure you are in a room with ample light so that you can get the phone screen really clean using reflections as your guide.These things aren't that hard to figure out. The side with the tab to pull off BEFORE application has a little bit of sticky on it obviously. I recommend NOT pulling the first strip completely off but doing what other reviewers have said and sliding it about halfway down, then using the supplied 'squeegee' to get it flat on your screen. One thing, I was glad there were three in the pack. I cleaned my screen off with the non-stick cloth and then used the first one to actually pick up more dust and invisible particles. This worked really well. The second one I used is actually on the phone right now and the third acts as a backup.Overall, if you have a little patience, these things work awesome. There is NO WAY you should spend anymore than a buck on these things. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND the higher priced ones available.PROS: EVERYTHING.CONS: NOTHING.",5
Great screen protector. protect my phone from dirt and sand. I zip tied this phone with these screen protectors on it to my dirt bike. I rode some laps around the track while video taping. Wrecked ones and it was good to go!,5
dont let the price fool you. these are a steal!!! 3 of them for 49 cents?! its cheap! i stuck one on and its stayed and protected my screen.,5
"scratches easily, thinner screen protector. I think i will buy a heavier duty one next time. They peel off over time pretty easily.",3
"Yes, these are a pain to get on and I find it troubling that there are no directions provided, but they are a cheap way to offer great protection for your phone. Good purchase.",4
this is a perfect fit for my droid x. Keeps the screen protected and is bubble free. great deal compared to store prices,5
"After reading several reviews I decided to order these for the Droid X. I was hesitant because so many people said it took them several tries to install them and they didn't come with instructions. Well the second part is true, they don't come with instructions because they don't need instructions. A monkey could put these on. Like all screen protectors they have a protective backing on each side of the 'real' screen protector. There are pull tabs to remove the clear backing from the screen protector and they are labeled with a '1' and '2'. Now I don't know, maybe I'm just a genius, but it would seem to me that is self explanatory. You simply remove the backing that has the '1' on it first, duh, and discard it. Then you stick the side that you just removed the first backing piece from face down to the screen. Then you smooth out the bubbles. Second, you pull the tab labeled '2' (what a coincidence) and voila. You're left with a nice crystal clear new screen protector. If that doesn't make since then perhaps the big words printed on the tab that state 'remove this first, and remove this last' will help. I read that some people were complaining about the sticky residue being left behind after they removed the labeled stickers from the backing. Well, that's because the pieces that are labeled are to be thrown away. They are not part of the screen protector! They are simply protecting the real screen protector until you put them on. This is a very simple task and anyone over 4 years old that doesn't still pee themselves should be able to do it. These protectors are very nice and cover the entire screen. You get three in a pack for under a dollar so buy some extra's.",5
This product arrived on time and was incredibly easy to install. Came with all necessary products to install and works great.,5
"The product arrived on time in the condition promised and as promised.  What i do not like is the email I got from the seller afterwards.  It provided a link to click to leave feedback, apparently it left 5 stars.  I would have done this anyways, but I find the practice deceptive.  But as far a a seller goes, top notch, would not hesitate to buy from again.  Putting the screen protector on, takes a bit of work, there are videos out there though.  I went with the dry technique and it's worked out find.",5
Bought these for Droid X. Shipping was fast and easy AND FREE!! I would recommend them to anyone looking for phone specific screen protectors. BEST screen protectors on the market!!!,5
"I was one of the few that didn't think I needed the screen protectors.  Was I wrong! After I got these, and applied it, I wasn't that happy with what I saw. Air bubbles.  But my son schooled me and showed me how to rub out the bubbles without scratching the screen.  Glad I bought them!",5
These work - my GF uses them on her droid - and almost never has to replace them - - she keep hers in her purse. I use these kind for a droid X - but those are a little  different.,5
These are worth the money.  They are not too cheap but they are not the best.  I would recommend them to a friend.,4
"Yes, these screen protectors are a bit thinner than others but they fit my husband's phone perfectly and there's three for under a dollar.  Seriously, you just can't beat that.  (I bet he loses the remaining two before he wants to replace the first one.)",5
Great product. These protectors were awesome and lasted a great time! Would buy again! Didn't hinder the screen or view or the touch screen.,5
"Exactly what I wanted for a great price! Just like every other screen protector, they are difficult to apply to the phone. It takes practice and patience.",5
"These screen protectors work very well, I can't even tell it's on. Definitely better than paying Verizon $15 for one.",5
"These protectors work, but not without difficulty. Not an easy install, but work fine when you get it right. Oh yeah...did I mention they were cheap :) thats always a plus.",3
I needed to use all three to get a perfect installation. Very frustrating but not really avoidable. there are other types of screen protectors that you apply with water that avoid the dust problems but they have their own issues.,4
These are the worst screen protectors.  I tried all 3 pcs and none of them would stick even after cleaning the phone.  Also they were a little too wide to even fit on my Droid X.  Spend a little more and get a quality item.,1
This is a must buy I am seeing that when I applied it to my phone I could not see my finger prints and I must admit I am happy with the timing (For some people it was rocket science but it was very easy to apply)I am happy that I did decide to buy looking forward to continued business with this company.,5
I wanted a screen protector for my phone and this one worked just fine.  It is easy to use and doesn't peel off easy once installed,5
"This is a great investment for anyone's droid x!! They provide idiot-proof instructions on how to best 'install' your screen protector, and I love how *each* screen protector comes with its own cleaning cloth! I got the package within a few days of ordering it, and I'm happy with my purchase.",5
you can't even tell this is on the screen once afixed.  I love this product and was a great price.,5
"There is not much to say about this screen protector.  It's the right size for the droid X, it work as it should, and it was cheap!",5
"I was skeptical about these since they were so inexpensive, however once I got I was able to put one on pretty fast.  It didn't come with a tool to take out the bubbles but found that a credit card work just fine.  Supposedly they can be reused if you take them off, but I would rather use a new one as the only reason I would remove it was cause it was to scratched or something like that.  Plus they were so inexpensive, I'd buy more if I ran out.  Good product.",4
"In spite of other reviews, I absolutely love this product. It went on easily, stays on wonderfully and is VERY durable. Buy it today to protect your investment.",5
"First off the price is RIGHT.  I ordered 3 packs of 3 because of the installation issues of others AND we have 3 Droid X's on our plan.  I was afraid I would have issue installing, but did not.  I placed a screen protector on each phone successfully the 1st try.  What's the mystery?Seems very simple to me.1.  Clean your screen w cloth provided2.  Peel off film with #1 tab marked on it3.  Place protector FACE DOWN (you know...the tab you just removed) on screen4.  Squeegee out any air bubbles with plastic piece provided5.  Peel off tab with #2 marked on itWhat's the fuss guys?  Lol, it couldn't get any easier than that!The screen protectors are super HIGH quality.  We paid $19.99 for one at the Verizon Store that was a total POS!  Can't believe they sell 3 for less than a dollar.Doesn't inhibit sensitivity of the capacitive screen in any way.10 star product!!!",5
"I read the reviews to learn how to apply the screen protector correctly.  It wasn't difficult at all, and fit my Droid X fine.",4
"I bought this screen protector along with purchasing the Splash screen protector for my Droid X at the same time. Since they looked similar, I wanted to compare the two. I had previously used Zagg shield but became frustrated with it because after awhile, noticed the scratch marks that healed left stretch marks. After I removed it, I noticed it had yellowed significantly-although the main purpose was to protect my screen, which it did. I applied this screen protector first. Application was very easy compared to others. I applied it and put it in my purse in a separate compartment. I took it out and boom! there was a big old scratch mark on it. It didn't go through the protector, and therefore did protect my screen, although I doubt whatever it was(I think it was my fake nail) that scratched the plastic  would have actually marred my screen, but nevertheless, it provided it's service for it's price.",3
"I decided to replace the original Verizon matte, non-glare protector that I'd had on the phone since I got it almost 2 years ago. I wanted a clear (non-matte) protector because I got tired of the 'pixelation' that it caused.  I could not be happier with this crystal clear product.  The colors are more vivid, and everything is more crisp.  It's easy to apply.  Really, it is.  There were no bubbles and no trapped dust particles.  It's not like I'm some kind of professional screen protector applier either!  There's a protective sheet on each side of the actual screen protector.  Just peel off part of the one that says to remove it first and line up the protector.  Peel the rest off as you apply it to the phone.  Smooth it out if needed, then peel off the top protector sheet, and there you have it!",5
"Really good quality and was easy to install. Not like most that I've used before. Also, got more than one so when this one gets crappy I have another 2 to work with. Great price, great quality.",5
"This is a VERY glossy skin. But I don't mind that at all. I primarily want it for protection, and the glare-resistant screen protector sold by Motorola (for $12) completely washed out the screen colors. Yuck! This one is highly transparent, but it is about 1/16th to 1/8 of an inch TOO SMALL for the Droid X. Ridiculous! I had trouble getting it on with zero bubbles. Have a couple of small ones I can't smooth out, but they are invisible when the unit is on, and I don't care that much when it is off, since the too-small screen is a much worse problem. Now lint is catching all along the edges, and that's worse than the glare and fingerprints.",2
Received product on time and was very happy with the packaging.  The product worked great on my droid x.  Highly recommend it to others.,5
Haven't had any real issues for price and protects have had mine for a couple of month.(ordered 6 still have 3 left) Can't beat it,5
"I like how they include multiple protectors to give you a little comfort when installing them. I recommend getting a nice amount of humidity in a bathroom with your shower before installing. Clean the screen with a lint free cloth then carefully lower it down, squaring it up against the top of the screen edge and it'll go on perfectly straight.",5
"I had a brand new Droid X and actually ordered 6 of these based on the generally positive reviews.  They arrived a few days later, packaged neatly.I watched the online video of how to put on a screen and went to work.  It was easy to line up and eliminate the air bubbles.  Using a great card helped tremendously.Me being a bit aloof, I tried to scrape off the #2 sticker and got a little frustrated.  I didn't realize that it was yet another layer that needed to be peeled off.  Once I did this, everything was gravy.Since then, I've used the same screen for a few weeks with frequent use.  I'm thinking the six screens will last years - at this great price!  Order with confidence.",5
I've tried a few of those wet applications and they never seem to work. This just goes on and it works. It may show smudges a little more than the glass but they are easily wiped off. Not bad for the price - actually a bargain.,4
these worked out great they were easy to put on and covered all of my screen on the phone that i had,5
"The ship time was very fast and I found these to be very easy to apply.  Before buying these I read some bad reviews.  Yes, Screen protectors can be a little tricky but all I did was clean my DroidX screen with a little windex, then I used the supplied micro fiber cloth to further remove dust.  I started at the bottom of the phone and slowly let the screen almost suck up the protector.  It went on very smoothly with no air bubbles.  Now, I did have one little bubble, I wouldn't call it an air bubble because while inspecting it in the glare of a light I noticed an extremely small dust particle right in the middle of it.  Fortunately, it was on the edge and was covered by the phone hard case.  So, make sure there is NO dust on the phone before trying to apply the protector.  This is only the second time I've applied a protector and other then the one tiny dust particle issue it went on perfectly.  Oh, and the fit was perfect too.  And the best part...I have 2 SPARES!",5
Works well for the price! sticks well once you know how to do it exactly without any 'bubble' on the screen.,5
Its not that these didnt work. They just didnt work great. None of the three became a hundred flush with the phone. They worked for a few days but then started to come off. For less than a dollar shipped i knew i shouldnt have expected much.,2
I have used several screen protectors and these seem to be the best quality. They are very durable and thick enough to really protect your screen yet not hinder the visibility by being cloudy or discolored. They apply easily without any air bubbles if you do it right and last a long time. Great stuff!,5
"I spent over an hour applying the screen protector.  Thought I was close on the 1st one but could not get rid of a major air bubble.  Spent waaay too much time applying the 2nd one and still cannot get a perfect fit in all four corners.  I wonder over time how much dust and dirt will accumulate and break the adhesion of the protector.  Oh wait, five minutes after applying one of the corners is detaching itself.Yes, the cost of the product is minimal but the product does not properly fit the device for which it is made (has anyone heard of the Motorola Droid X ?).  If your hourly rate is more than $1/hour this product is not worth your time.  And only time will tell if/how well the protector stays adhered.  It seems the manufacturer missed a quality check or two and user experience feedback.  Hard to believe they took this to market!",1
I had to take it to my phone peeps and let them do it. Its worth letting someone that knows what they are doing put it on.,5
Took me 2 tries to place it but I got it figured out after the first placing. It was easy to get on just had issues with dust specs. It is smooth and seems like a second skin it's not even there!,4
"Just what the Doctor ordered. You can not go wrong with this product.  Very cheap, and good quality for the money. I will be using them again. Thanks",5
"Received the item with no problem, however the screen protectors suck. Hard to put on and get the bubbles out, yes, I did clean the screen very, very well. But for .90 cents I didn't really expect much. Honestly, I got them because I was a dollar short for free shipping.",1
"Thankfully this was a 3 pack.  These are a real hassle to install.Let me say that I am by no means new to installing screen protectors, I have had them on my phones for a few years now.  These ones seem to be high quality once installed.The problem I had was that once your apply them, even partially, they cannot be reapplied.  If you start the process of laying it on the screen and have to lift it off even partially, it will no longer stick where you previously applied it.  Thankfully, this was a 3 pack, so on the 3rd attempt I got one installed correctly.  For the price, even after losing the first 2 during installation, it is still cheaper than many of the other brands.I cant give this item 5 stars due to the non-reusable aspect.  But when looked at in a price vs performance basis these are hard to beat.",4
"When you buy this you will receive the instructions via email.  I would recommend you NOT follow the video instructions, because my experience was that using a credit card to smooth the product leaves many permanent scratches.  I interpret this as a sign of what is to come through normal use.  The product is cheap enough, so no big loss to try it.  I did get a couple bubbles under it.  Upon close inspection I can see that it was because of tiny pieces of lint.  I cleaned the phone several times with a lint free cloth before installing, but it's pretty difficult to not have ANY lint on something I guess [at least in my house :-) ].  I do like that my finger slides across the product better than on the screen, so using swype is easier.  Overall, it's not very attractive with the bubbles and scratches, so I'm trying to decide if I should just remove it.  Motorola Milestone X)",3
"This protector replaced the Splash protector on my droid.  The new protector was much easier to apply than other protectors that I have tried.  The screen appears brighter and with better clarity, even in sunlight.  This protector has a matte finish.My suggestion is to clean screen with a cloth, then use the included cloth, then blow some air to remove any latent dust particles.  I also found that using a nitrile glove made installation a snap.I will definitely purchase again from this seller.",5
It comes in packages of three because it takes a few tries to get it on without bubbles!  Works quite well.,4
Cheap case. Protected my phone well even after I dropped it. Gets grimy and shows dirt is the only down side.,3
i purchased this and loved it.. its so pretty on my phone and i am glad i brought it. i will buy this again.,5
"Purple is one of my favorite colors.  I have enjoyed with case.  The case is great, colorful and eye catching.  This fit right into my wardrobe.",5
"I bought this because it's so cute & feels peaceful. I love it and it's so soft, girly and protective",5
"I really like this cover. Its super cute and fits great on my iphone 4. It came REALLY early too, which was amazing! The only downfall is, on the bottom right corner its has a little broken part. Pretty sure its broken. It looks like that in the picture too, but; to me.. it looks broke. Over all it protects the phone and gets the job done!",4
"I'm sure I left this feedback already but anyway here we go.. I love this item, a must have with the exception of photos... the photos taken comes back gray in color, must take case off if you want to have beautiful photos...However I do love it!",5
I love this cover. It feels good in the hand.  Easy to grip. Protects The glass From minor drops and bumps.,4
"I really enjoyed this case, because the colors were fantastic. It is a beautiful case. I really enjoyed it.Very Nice",5
"just as you see it, the colors were awesome. I had purchased this for my mother, she was very happy.",5
"I ordered my case on a Saturday and had it by Friday which was really nice. Case is a hard plastic and seems pretty durable but I haven't used it yet so I can't say for sure, but it really feels sturdy, not like some cases that are really flimsy. Case looks like picture except purple is a little deeper, not quite as bright as advertized. It's a beautiful case and has front protection too. It snaps into place and fits verizon Iphone perfectly!! But the case is hard to get off after it's snapped into place. Camera cutout looks small but does not block view at all. Front cover goes up to screen bottom and only the home button is exposed. Looks great with white or black Iphone.",5
I like this case a lot. It's very cute and makes me feel nice but it's not very good in the protective area. But it works none the less.,4
This case is really pretty. The colors are vibrant. It does not include the screen protector so be sure an purchase that. It is hard to remove so be aware that it would not be good for someone who has trouble with their hands.,5
I ordered this case because of how it looks. I don't really do well with hard only cases though because they don't last long after being dropped a couple times.,3
I use this one every day. I like the way it feels and it isn't too heavy.  I like the change,5
"I GOT THIS FOR MY SISTER IPHONE AND IT WAS SO EASY TO SNAPON AND HARD TO REMOVE WHICH IS GREATAND WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS AND THE DROP YOUR PHONE THIS CASE WILL PROTECT ITFOR SUREIF YOU LOOK AT THE PIC IT WILL PRETTY MUCH COVERS ALL THE PHONE EDGES, AND MOREAND I DO RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU HAVE KIDDOS HAHAHAFAST SHIPPING W/IN 2 DAYS IT WAS GREAT THANK YOU GREAT SERVICE",5
I love the design on this cover. The cover itself is really thick. It makes it hard to push any of the buttons on the side or top of my phone. Other than it being really thick plastic the cover fits perfect. It also makes the phone kind of bulky.,2
"Again, these cases are priced right, ($3)and fit perfectly. Offer good corner protection and a variety of color combinations for the girls different moods.",5
This is a fabulous case!  I love the color and the print has an Asian screen painting feel about it.  It has been dropped a few times and has held up perfectly. The 2 part construction feels good in your hand and will put your mind at ease. Your phone is protected without a lot of additional bulk.,5
she loved it told all her friends where she got it said she would buy another one when she needs one,5
"If you like the colors, then this is a great choice for a hard case. The price was good and the case can take the wear of daily usage.",5
Wonderful case.  This was the first cheap case for my wife and lasted a year through all the ups and downs and replaced it based off of the picture was finally wearing away.,5
Love the bright color and the texture of this case. I receive lots a compliments from others. Others want to know where I got it I don't want to tell them so they cannot copy me.,5
got this case for my sister. She says the paint is chipping off and that the case covers her ear sensor so sometimes her calls will hang up when she puts the phone to her face. its a good hard case if you're not worried about that stuff though.,3
Love to have lots of cases to change weekly:) they fit well on my iPhone 4S. Colors are sooo nice ! Amazon has everything!!!!,5
"I purchased these creen protectors for my niece. Seemed to take forever to get here, but she really likes them, and is happy with the purchase",5
It looks awesome but didnt like to stay snapped together. It was a good case but i could be made better.,4
I like hard cases because its easy to take out of my pocket so this case is nice for me and the flowers are cute,4
Love the case - pretty flowers - no complaints - I'm using it right now. Love it because it covers the front of iPhone too!!! Awesome!!!,5
I bought it for my mom and she liked it. The only down side is it fades pretty quickly over time. But it's still very durable.,4
"The phone has a very nice print and I received alot of compliments, however, the print started to peel off too soon and after a couple of months the cover was practical white...no more print.  I was dissappointed.",3
"This is an inexpensive product, works well and if you aren't rough with your electric devices, you shouldn't have any problems. I haven't had any problems at all.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is this: it will barely hold onto the charger. Unless I'm using the stand-up charger in the front room, I can't get the phone to charge. The way the cover is shaped causes the charger to be pushed out, and I'm constantly pushing it back in. I've waken up to a dead phone and a long commute and no way to keep it charged. That is my one and only complaint. I just make sure that I don't touch it during the nighttime when it's charging for fear that the case will cause it to disconnect.",4
I really liked the design and color of this cover and liked how it snapped on the phone. We definitely recommend this product!,5
"I placed my order on Jan 4th from Seller1ON1. I received it today (9th).  The Snap-on Protector Hard Case Image Cover 'Artistic Purple Flowers' Design' for Apple iPhone 4 & 4S did not come as shown in the picture. In the picture It cover the top speaker as well as, the bottom, but the one I received does not have that. In the picture its white case with design, the one I received is gray with the design. I KNOW I SHOULD B DISAPPOINTED RIGHT, but I like the one I received looks better than the one in the picture, so it worked out for me.",4
I love this covet it covers the entire phone it's smooth and fits perfect oh and ou can't beat this deal.,5
Nice case with a nice design. I like how it wraps around the front of the phone. Seems to protect it more.,5
We love this case it hugs your iPhone giving the illusion of safety. I would buy it again in the future.,5
"Very pretty case, but I don't care for the two piece case. It's harder to get to the button on the top.",5
I bought this one for my cousin and she absolutely loves it. She loves that it covers the front of the phone besides the screen.,5
"I love this case. Sturdy, attractive and inexpensive. Fits iPhone 4 perfectly. Very happy with this case because it makes my ugly white iPhone 4 look good.",5
This is one of my favorites... It didnt take long to recieve and it protects my phone perfectly. I love it,5
I currently have this case on my Iphone and love it. Everyone that sees it inquires where I got it. I've been telling everyone about Amazon.com.,5
This wasn't what I expected. It was okay but does not look like the lecture to me. Not sure if its very durable?,2
"It's very pretty :) I'm happy I bought it. It seems pretty durable as well. The white isn't dirty yet. It did come with the paint a little scratched though, but I assumed I'd get some of that anyways through wear and tear. I like that it protects my phone with out being overly bulky.It is a PAIN to get off though, and it took quite a while to come in the mail.",4
Shows dirt very easily. If you are a busy mom always on the go with little grubby hands touching your phone all the time you may want to get something that is a darker color.,2
Went to snap it on and it broke. We ordered like 20 so I cannot complain that 3-4 broke.Others were fine!Some did not fit the i-pod 4,1
thank u .. loved it .. same as pic.. happy with that xx xx xx xx xx xxx xx xx,5
This case is my all time favorite case ! It covers and protects my iPhone beautifully ! I would recommend this to anyone . It does cover the phone on the front side more than others ! I wish I could find this design more ! Love it !,5
"I received my case yesterday I have to say that Really like the case. It covers who phone, the design is nice.",5
This is wonderful in color. I coordinate my cases with my outfits as I need to. Very fun and very affordable.,4
This is a really good case my mom and i both love it and keeps the phone from getting dirty and fits snug!,5
My granddaughter is very happy with the quality.  Friends want to know where she got it from.  She loves it.,5
"The case is exactly as shown and I appreciate the little extra plastic around the front control button. Not many cases have that option but I think it protects the face of the phone better with it. The only downside is the case is very slippery. My former case was a hard plastic that had a rubberized type of film on it so it wasn't so smooth and shiny. Just wish it had a little more grip so the phone didn't slide out of my hand. The design is nice though and overall a great case, especially for the price.",4
"the protector hard case, fit just right, I have acces to all my buttons in my iphone 4s, Have not had any issues with it.",5
"Yes, it seems a bit steep in price, but I think its worth it. This is a very high quality screen protector -- noticeably thicker than those cheapos from ebay. It has 2 protectors, one for the front and one for the back. And let's face it. With an iphone 4, you need all the protection you can get!  Oh, it also comes with a HUGE microfiber cloth about 6' x 4',which alone will set you back almost as much as this whole kit costs if you bought the cloth seperately. And it's a *real* microfiber cloth, not one of those fake, crappy ones that you get with the crapy ebay screen protectors. Well worth the money!",5
This product is awesome and the price is even better. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. It was easy to apply and much less expensive than purchasing this at the kiosk stands in the mall.,5
"First off, I ordered from Abe-123 and received it in a speedy amount of time and they were great. It came with a back and 2 fronts. They are all antiglare even though they dont look like it from the outside. The screen protecter does not affect the quality of the retina and are the best ones on amazon. Trust me, I've ordered at least 5 screen protecters and these were the only ones as advertised and good quality. Most of the ones I ordered claimed to be antiglare and weren't.Applying the screen protecter was easy. Just be sure to use the blue thing that comes with it before applying. You just put the blue thing on te screen and take it off. It removes the lint which causes less bubbles. I put it on wrong at first but I just took it off and moved it and nothing bad happened. If you need screen protecters, get these!!",5
"I have tried several different film coverings for the iPhone 4, and this is by far the best.  It is extremely easy to place on the surfaces and you are given plenty of material to clean off smudges.  They also give you adhesives to clear away lint.  After placement, there were virtually no air bubbles, and the texture is fantastic to the feel and for excellent vision even on sunny days.  I highly recommend this product.",5
Protector doesn't stick to the screen. Used the two protectors that came in a package without success . A waste.,1
I love this type of case and have several! They fit perfect.  Occasionally you get one that one snap won't stay closed but the vendor will send you a new one.,5
I found this case for a pennie.  To bad i went on a trip and the phone got stolen so good thing i dident buy one that was more.,5
i really liked this case cover at first but then after a using it a few days it just started to fade and turn yellowish. plus not to mention how easy dirt shows up on it!,3
Everything was great till the white on it started turning yellow and no I dont smoke and was not around smokers so dont know how that happen. other then that it worked.,3
"Works well.  It took over a year, but began to showing rib marks on the corners revealing a white color.  Easy fix is a black marker to bring it back to black.  This has to be done again over time but I don't mind.  It protects my phone and the case is taking the wear and not the phone which is the way it should be, so it is doing its job.  It is easy to take on and off and doesn't add alot of extra weight to the phone, feels nice in my hand and doesn't attract lint.  Overall a good simple snap-on shield.  I always use a screensaver though because it is necessary.",4
"Fast shipping, good quality, especially for the price. Super tight fit, have to really squish it on though or one corner pops open. No matter, it stays on once extra pressure is applied. Great price too!",5
"I needed a temporary case for protection until i found one I liked. It served it's purpose. The white began to rub off after a week and the case became dirty quickly. I didn't expect anything different though because I paid 1 cent for it. If you are planning on using this long term, that might not be a good idea.",3
I ordered the black case previously and it worked out well. Sturdy made to protect the beauty of your phone and does its job as a plain phone case.,4
I suggest that you go to your nearest mall and find a kiosk that sells phone cases to purchases these screen protectors because the ones on Amazon are entirely too thick.,2
"Does everything its says it should do, not much to say but its a good product for a really good price",5
I dumped all 3 screen protectors in the trash bin. The stuff in the package are fancy but in reality they are good for nothing ...,1
"Great product for the price! A little bit of rainbow effect on the screen but nothing too major. Good protection, low price.",4
"Worked great, cheap price, screen fit the way it was suppose to, wouldn't recommend to reuse, but you can pull it off and reapply once or twice. Good product.",5
It was hard to put on but when I finally got it on it was an amazing experience ! It's like it's not even there ! I would love to come back and buy some more on here if I need to.,5
"For the price, it was a great deal. It was as expected for a screen protector but DEFINITELY not reusable. once they were taken off, they were not sticky enough to put back on, and it was all bubbly when you did manage to get it to stay on.",3
"I just got these, and I actually really like them! The first time I didn't get the protector on well, so I had to get to the second one (which apart from lint that somehow wound it's way on my screen), went on well, the back one did too!They do attract my finger prints like crazy but I just wipe them off and its fine.They are cut pretty accuratelyThey are solid and seem to be working fine so i'm happy, that I won't have to spend a ton of money on super expensive plastic, when these do the job just as well :)",5
"I wanted something that was going to protect my phone, not only the front, but the back too. I have been thoroughly pleased with how these have protected my phone from scratches. Excellent buy!",5
"Still learning to love these even when they get the annoying little bubbles, but they do their job and protect your screen from getting dirty.",5
"Screen protectors that also cover the back of iPhones are hard to come by, the protectors work wonders if you have the iPhone's bumper style cases where the back is exposed.",4
You get what you pay for I guess. As soon as you put this screen protector on it automatically bubbles.,1
"I still have them, they last forever than you for being so generous with them and the price. Buying them in the store would have made a dent in my pocket if I got as many as you sold me.",5
These screen protectors aren't the best but will do for some people. They have a tendency to bubble even when you are really careful.,3
For the price-this is great! Had no problem applying it on the phone and now I can take my phone out from the bulky cover I have and not to be afraid to scratch it. Looks like there is nothing! Good product!,5
I buy a couple of these a month and they are awesome. They are good quality and they get here pretty quickly.,5
otter box better includes screen protector holder clip for belt nice colors  fall protection and so on . get this product if u just want to keep it small hidden or plain,1
"Their ok, the protective cover keeps scratches off.  Has several bubbles but does the job.  Its clear and glossy. Not a bad buy.",3
Works well. used it for three months straight. Sometimes i forgot it was on there it looked so great. Corners didnt peel or anything. I reccommend.,4
The screen protectors they sent me were a little stiffeither from age or the materials used.  They work as well as the ones that costway too much.,3
"You can't beat the price of these screen protectors. I originally paid $30 for a screen protector from another company. These screen protectors aren't the best quality, but really after a while ALL screen protectors become discolored and peel off around the edges. I recommend getting a whole bunch of these protecters and just replace when needed. They're so cheap you don't feel bad using a new one.",4
THESE PROTECTERS ARE GREAT TO HAVE BECAUSE THEY CAN PROTECT THE FRONT AND BACK OF YOUR PHONE AND YOU NEVER REALIZE HOW DIRTY AND SCRATCHED UP THE BACK CAN GET EVEN IN A CASE WITHOUT ONE OF THESE,5
Fit as good as factory at a fraction of the price. Did a great job as it was designed. Very nice,5
I bought these for my daughter. Has expected a little hard to position but the fit is good. Does what I expected.,4
Pretty much this looks like a what you get for trying to cheap out.  This seller basically just cut these out himself and burned holes to fit the camera and home button.  All 3 of the protective screens all have a yellow tint on them and have those bumps that plastic materials get when you burn them.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT.,1
"That is a good case, clear and thin, good for iphone4, I bought it for my girlfriend, she like it",5
"I'm all for inexpensive things... but I still appreciate quality. Don't trust the picture--these are super thin. They create air bubbles like crazy. Even if you think you've removed every trace of dust from your phone surface, as soon as you put the screen on, the screen will find any spec of dust within a 15 foot radius and create a huge air bubble around it--preferably right in the middle of your screen--that will annoy you daily as you use your phone. You can try to push the air bubbles out to the edge, but these screen protectors don't work that way and your efforts will be futile.These screen protectors are also magnets for fingerprints and the natural oils that our skin produces. They love it. They love to give you a nice, smeary look on your otherwise impeccable iPhone screen.These is a reason why you get three in this pack for such a low price: THE COMPANY IS GIVING THEM AWAY.You know what I do like though? I like that there is a protector for the back of the phone as well. Even when I replace the front one--which I absolutely will because these air bubbles and fingerprints are the bane of my existence--I will probably keep the back one. It has the same issues with the air bubbles and fingerprints, but at least I don't look at the back side nearly as much as I do the front.",1
i order my screen protector last week and it said it would not be till September and it i just received my screen protector about 3 weeks early. that is why i rate a 3.,3
I have not received this item yet.  I will evaluate the item once I receive it and can check it out.,4
eso es lo mejor que ay para los rayasos de y de otros cosas es muy bueno y me encanta,5
well lets start off by saying i love the fact that i had one for the front and one for the back. its amaizing the the back one didnt come off,3
"Just like any other screen cover I have gotten. Went on smooth, I didn't have any problems with it. It's nice to have the back screen protector with is for sure.",5
"The product is as pictured and as described. The protector is as difficult to put on as all screen-protectors in this style are. Don't complain, just take it to best buy and pay $10 to have them put it on for you. The product does its job and fits the iPhone 4 (and thus the 4S) as it's supposed to. It is nice that you get front and back. If you are interested in the pictured and described screen protectors, I would recommend them to you.",5
Very clear but didn't stick to well.  I will not order another one though. I'll try another brand. These things are trial and error anyhow.,3
"i put this on my iphone the other day, and they didn't want to stay on. the other day the front came off, and i put it back on. but it looks bad, they wont stick to the screen at all the back one is doing the same thing.",1
"I wasn't expecting it to come with three of each, but it's a good thing it did. It took all three on the back for it to even look half way decent. I think the covers are kind of old because it seems like bad quality. It also scratches very easy. I wouldn't recommend it.",2
"This screen protector was decent, but got stratched easily, so I had to replace it within a couple of months. I recommend spending more money and getting a military-grade protector, which has more clarity and resistance to damage.",4
"The screen protector are good, however the instruction are fall short in what is front and back and how to apply. I may or may not buy more.",3
I ordered 3 front & 3 back screen protectors and only received one front & one back protector. I give 3 stars because the product shipped and got to me incredibly fast and the screen protectors I did get were good quality for the price. Just wish I would have gotten all 3 that I ordered.,3
I rate it to 5 cause It's perfect for my iphone 4 and I don't have to worry about my kids messing it's up.,5
"Cheaper quality than Body Guardz or similiar, but what could you expect for the price. Easy scratches and gouges. But highly recommended in desperately needed.",3
These were a purchase I was somewhat neutral on. They provided adequate protection but they seemed to hinder the touch screen functions.Any screen protector damages your ability to interact with what it's protecting isn't serving its purpose.The back screen protector is why I've rated this 4/5 stars--- i love that it protects that back.,4
"I love this product because you get front and back protectors,But I can't see how it is reusable when it goes on like all the other screen Protectors,Anyway the price you can't beat.",4
One can never have enough of these. It covered my screen and back perfectly (when applied correctly). There was/is no bubbles whatsover.You can't tell there's a cover on my phone at all.,5
it Keep my safe and i love it alot i cant wait to order some more screen protector this week yeah,5
its good i like that it protects welli sticks on the phone well and i might buy extras for my family,3
"Its very good but first time there was not any instruction for installation so I messed up, but company send me another packet without any cost and its work very well.",5
"No way you can put this on without unsightly air pockets. They are badly undersized and not square. Impossible to match up the cut outs where they belong. The little cleaning square of cloth is so rough it will scratch the front glass of your iPhone. Generally a piece of cheap junk. I guess if you buy junk, you get junk. No instructions of any kind came with this item. Another candidate for the garbage.",1
This screen protector is absolutely horrible! I could never get the bubbles out.  Made the phone look dirty.  Do not order!,1
"Item was as described, And works perfect; the only missing things is that dont come with easy steps, beside that is just the protection  than you need.",5
This works like it is supposed to.  Easy to install and has a low profile.  Every phone needs one for protection.,5
"these are wonderful, not too think so they get caught and pulled up easy and they are scratch resistant even if not advertized that way",5
Won't get any better for the price. At first is a bit of a pain and the corners don't seem to stick too well. Other than that it is a good product.,3
"cheaply made, not much else to say. You get what ya pay for. Very much like other cases available here",1
SO HARD TO INSTALL NO INSTRUCTION U NEED TO BE I LIKE A DUST FREE AREA IN ORDER TO THIS I DONT LIKE IT DONT GET IT OR GO TO SOME ONE THAT CAN INSTALL IT FOR U,1
worked great would order more next time came real fast even though some product coming from china other places in the world,5
"It does help protecting the back and front for the iPhone, totally recommended.  So cheap as well very good quality.",4
was exactly what they said. you get 2 sets of front and back which is nice and easy application for anyone,5
I am sorry to rate this with one star. But the truth is it doesn't even fit iphone. it's useless.,1
To this day I still have the same protectors on my phone. Work great and very easy to apply when you do it right. Great price and I'm very happy with the purchase.,5
I've never seen any reason as to why I should spend $20 on screen protectors and these are a perfect example as to why. They're perfect!,5
you can't beat it for the price. a little hard to put on bubble take a while to go away.,3
"Super easy to install. No bubbles if you&#8217;re careful and precise.  Great fit on my SPRINT 4s, and super clear.  I love having a back protector in addition to the traditional front.",5
I purchased this and it filled my expectations the shipping was fast. i can recommend it since they came as described.,4
"good plastic, I bought a phone for my daughter, thank you for a good buy buy another one for my son-in short, very satisfied with the quality and price.",5
"Once your phone is heated, skin temperature on a hot day/battery heating, screen heating, the protect itself will displace and 'slide' off the screen. I have experience it quite a few time during the use of the GPS and leaving it in my pocket while driving. The screen just slide off like 1/4 of the screen and I can use force to push it back but it got dust on it by then.Future buyer might consider paying a bit more to get a more reliable screen protector.",2
"You get what you pay for...sometimes. Pretty good to have if you know how to place it properly, its not the best you can buy but its also not the greatest.",4
"it is really fast and good quality. and also, it is really beautiful and easy to use. i like it.",5
just no. seriously do not buy. the guy at the apple store couldnt even get it on without bubbles and he had to give me a new one.,1
it does the trick....i dont know if its supposed to do more than what they show here....i dont even know how to review this item....its cheap get it.,3
I love how quickly it arrived. I did not need it right away but really was surprised how quick it arrived! AWESOME!,5
"I've installed quite a few screen protectors and I could NOT get these ones to install without bubbles!  The glass was clean, but I could not get them to install properly.",1
"These do a decent job for the money, but don't expect professional results. There is a bit of a rainbow glare in direct sun, but that is usually countered by using the Auto-Brightness feature. I switched from these to an anti-glare b/c fingerprint oils tend to accumulate in the most touched spots.Application is a little tricky. Read through this, but know it will make more sense in the moment.The protector comes in three layers: two peel-off coverings labeled by pull tabs marked '1' and '2' and the third layer in the middle being the protector itself. One tab exposes the side that will be placed onto the phone screen and the other exposes the side that you will touch. The directions indicate to remove the layer that exposes the side to the phone screen, place onto the phone and smooth out, then remove the layer that exposes the &#34;touching&#34; side. If you aren't careful, you can pull the protector off the phone when you try to remove the layer for the &#34;touching&#34; side, thus exposing the screen to dust and more bubbles.  Your finished result will most likely be bubbly and unusable.I prefer to remove the layer for the touching side first, clean the phone screen, then remove the phone screen layer, apply quickly, then smooth out bubbles. Inevitably you will get some dust trapped in and have a few bubble spots, but they should be minor. Don't use a credit card or anything abrasive to remove bubbles - you will make marks on the protector. A softer piece of plastic works better (think a key ring card - cvs card, kroger plus, etc).",3
was perfect with having the front and back screen protector. very easy to put on and does prevent scratches :),5
"Both protectors apply easily. The plastic is smooth, feels good, and doesn't scratch or pick up fingerprints as easily as other cheap protectors I've used. And with both front and back protected, the phone is pretty much guaranteed to always look brand new if taken care of.",5
"It really helps protect the phones from scratches. Instructions are easy to follow, anyone can put them on. they last a long time.",5
Took a long time to get but it really is a lot cheaper than buying them in the store so if you have some time to spare and want to save the green this is a good option,3
Great protectors. I used them throughout the life of my iPhone and sold it for top dollar without a single scratch on the screen. They work very well,5
"I use a stylus and I'm rough on screens. Theseare cheap enough and I mainly bought thesefor the screens for the back of the phone. Back4S screens are hard to find these days, retailthinks everyone has 5S so don't carry them.",5
I bought 3 of these for everyone's phone in my household and I have to say its great! It was very easy to apply and it did not cause much air bubbles on the screen.,5
"It works fine, and its easy to clean off, keeps the screen from scratches. What more can I say, thanks JG",5
I Love the price and love how well they work on my iphones! Def recommended if your interested in front and back covers as I am!,5
This item is a good thing to have to protect the screen. It's a little difficult to apply it on your phone without any air bubbles.,4
"Ok let's be realistic, this stuff isn't the same extreme quality as the $20 stuff that is scratch proof even when using your keys on it... BUT it is still very durable and protects your phone very well. This I know from experience as these screen savers have saved me many deep scratches from dropping my phone on concrete and asphault (i'm a klutz!). Again, you get 3 SETS OF FRONT AND BACK for only $1.20!!! The average life span of these screen protectors under heavy use is about 4-6 months before they have noticeable scuffs and scratches on them which you can see while your iphone is turned off (you can still clearly see the screen when it is on). So for $0.40 cents each set of front and back, you got your phone covered for over a year! And if you're not very good at applying these things on your phone like I wasn't at first, you have 3 TO PRACTICE WITH! I have gotten good at applying these and now can do so without having EVEN A SINGLE air bubble or piece of dust underneath.INSTRUCTIONS:The key is to wipe the phone clean, go to a non-dusty environment, take off the step one screen. Next, hold the protector from the edges (DO NOT GRAB THEM OTHERWISE YOU WILL LEAVE YOUR FINGERPRINT AND SKIN OIL UNDER THE SCREEN PROTECTOR, DUH!).After you line the protector up with the push button and speaker/front camera area, bend the protector (convex shape facing the phone screen) and apply it to the phone from the center first, then release and allow the rest of the protector to make contact with the screen. This process makes sure that no air gets trapped in the center of the protector. Next, use an old credit card or something similar to work the air bubbles at the edge of the protector out from under the protector in an OUTWARD motion from the center of the phone to the edges. And presto, protected phone screens for everyone!",5
It works and its cheap. It goes on easilly and stays on with a perfect fit. What else do you want? Im just gonna add these other words because amazon wont let me submit this review with so little to say. But hey. What else is there to say?,5
they work good but they start to fade away after a while. it does protect the phone pretty good but it does fade away fast.,3
"great screen protector, have recommended to others. clear and no problems installing.don't have phone anymore but gave extra's to new owner.Juan",5
"this came on time. the material isn't those thick ones, but the thin ones that just right onto the screen. I have use the mirror ones for my 3G Iphone and it was thick. but i like this one!",4
Came very early way before the time it said it would. Just update the picture because I was expecting to get thee but then realized its just one. :) So that's why I gave it 4 starts since the picture says three and that's what I was expecting,4
"Well it came on time and I even got an extra front cover! But the sticker on the front of one of my front covers, that help you peel it off so you can put it on your phone wouldn't come off. Made it look pretty bad, but the rest of my covers didn't do that.",2
"The back protectors are great and do the job well. For the front protectors, the holes are not aligned well and are a bit off. The hole for the home button is too big. You have to align the protector based on the hole for the camera so that it doesn't interfere with your pictures, but by doing so, it makes the screen protector not completely adhere to the glass at the bottom. You'd have to cut the screen protector yourself by a hairline to make it stick flat. These protectors scratch a bit easily as I can see some hairline scratches after having them for a couple months.Overall, they're okay screen protectors being at less than a dollar. Be sure to take your time applying them and use one piece of tape to lift the screen protector and another to remove the dust that gets trapped underneath while you're applying it. You really don't need to use another film if you mess up. It takes me around 20 minutes to get a screen protector on perfectly without bubbles or dust.",3
I used 3 screen protectors but I could not apply them without bubbles or pealing shortly thereafter.  May be my fault and not the product BUT I could not apply them correctly,2
"It helps to protect you Iphone from any scratches ,damages or anythingWe'll recommend this itemThank you!Kiddy Hamman",4
I feel like I ordered these and they came the next day even though they really didn't they came so fast but they came really quick. It is of great quality and deff worth the price,5
Nice,4
Took me a few tries to get the screen protector on it didn't matter what I did it still got air bubbles. Eventually I gave up and ordered a different product.,1
"this screen product cannot stick to iphone screen perfect, there are so many bubbles and looks ugly, don't buy it",1
"My back protector is coming off, and for a phone that stays in a case for 80% of the time it doesnt speak to highly of the product. but it still works and for my needs I cant complain.I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn't plan on also using a case.",3
I got exactly what is in the picture. They are very good on my iphone and i would buy more.,5
Great protector and it was a nice price and quanity for what was paid for them and came on schedule.,4
"The actual screen protectors themselves were great. They provided good coverage for my phone, and no whines there. But the thing was that in the description it promises 3 of them and it thought that meant 3 front and 3 back, but they actually mean 1 back and 2 front. So they're great, I loved them, just make sure you are aware of this little detail.",4
"I purchased this item even with all the bad reviews. So when I received it I expected the worst. But it was the total opposite. It covers my iPhone 4 really good & I can't even tell the cover is there. It was delivered before the date, which is really great. I really recommend this item it's cheap & has good quality.",5
"These are great for protecting the screen but need to be replaced regularly, especially when debris gets in-between. The back screen protector is great for use with a bumper but isn't really needed with a regular case.",4
Well it's does the job protects the phone some small scratches its good for a temporarily protection but not for long protection for the back of the phone it works great .,5
"This product is not exactly as advertised.  It comes in 3 pieces, not 2 as shown in their ad.  It is hard to put on, and you certainly can't reuse the product as they advertise.  Additionally, I don't know if it is me or not, but I can't get the screen protector on without any bubbles under it.  If you are looking for something cheap that will work, and don't care about the bubbles, then this one is for you.  If you want something that is easy to put on and you can't tell that it's there, then buy something else.",2
"Great protection, but I have a hard time getting it on with no bubbles. Even at that you can text and use phone without any problem.",5
I loved that there was more than 1 in each package. They went on easy and look great! Great buy!,5
"So the picture shows x3 which to me means i get 3 of them. I only got a front and back piece. they work fine, i just thought there would be more of them.",3
these screen protector are pretty good.can't complain about them.i would recommend someone to buy these.i would again if i had an iphone 4,4
This product was not good.  I expected that for 1.15 including shipping it wouldn't be great but I have ordered this product before for pretty cheap and it worked great.  It would not seal completely to my phone even without any dust on the phone.  None of them worked.,1
"WOW - this arrived faster than I thought. The protectors are great, got a couple for back up, becuase its nice to switch them out once in awhile. Easy to place on phone and have no problems. If seller sales other stuff, I will order from them again - Because shipping was FAST.Thanks!",5
this is a great product i share it with my aunt why i buy so many and a lot in one pack,4
went on great for the first time. I did not need to flatten for the air bubble. it just went on clear and great.,5
better and faster than I expected. same quality as the one I paid $15 dollars  for.very happy with the purchase.,4
When I first went to put it on I had fuzzies on the screen so I just took the protector off and cleaned it then put it back on and now I have maybe one air bubble from it. Its nice and smooth and barely noticeable. Super cheap but good quality.,5
i recommend it. it protects both your screen and the back of the phone from scratches and falls which we all would like to prevent.,4
"These cover my iPhone 4 nicely. They went on easily without bubbling.  I am able to put my iPhone in a flip case holder without any problems, and in the charging stand as well.",5
I love these.  I keep these on hand because we have 6 kids who all have iphone 4's and you never know when someone is going to need a new screen protector.  I will be ordering these again in the new future.,5
Going through all my purchased items to review and realized I never did receive this !  Ordered a bunch of things and got everything else.  Just not this!,1
"I'm so glad they fit perfectly. It was really easy to install as well. Make sure you are in a dust free environment. However you want to get that, its up to you. Pricewise or not... its worth it.If the 'oil' film effect affects you, well... honestly, go spend ... on another protector that is 20 times the cost and does the exact same thing.",5
"It messed up as soon as I got it and put it on my phone.. and the shipping was way to high.If I wouldn't known that, I would not have ordered it.I work at a post office so I know that The shipping price was OUTRAGEOUS!!Other than that.. I'll still use it, but I probably won't buy again.",2
"The protective film is nice, easy to apply, however it is easily susceptible to scratches.  I've used it for a few weeks now, and I already have a bunch of scratches on the front... however it's still protecting my phone, so not bad for what I paid for.",2
Really difficult to attach. it does not come with the bubble card to get air bubbles out of the way. It is nearly impossible to have it put on the screen.  I used ANKER Screen Protectors before and they are awesome. Hopefully they have one for the iPhone 4.,1
They sop your phone from showing wear and tear.  Makes it easier for a resale.  It also sustain damages that might have effect your screen,5
I've purchased these inexpensive screen protectors in the past and am yet to be dissapointed. It truly doesn't matter how much you pay for one of these the difficulty of install is about the same. Key points are make sure your screen is extremely clean and dust free. Align screen protector and use credit card to smooth out. It took me exactly 5 minutes to do each side. I had 2 air bubbles in the back due to dust and one small one in the front. Would definitely purchase again. Mine was shipped out from Abe-123.,5
"Really good quality, protects the screen and the back. &#34;Reusable&#34;? I don't know about that.. But it is okay for the price",5
"Fits good but it is too hard to stick, bubbles everywhere. There must be instruction how to do it easy, or something to help. Could not use them",3
"This product is great, exactly as described. The only reason for 4 stars, is that it did take a little while to ship. Other then that i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great screen protector.",4
"works awesome, no finger smuges on screen. arrived sooner then expected. will deffently order more when need them , ,",5
worked like a charm and protected my case.  def a must buy and great for the price.  thank you !,5
"I have been using this product since I purchased my Iphone in the beginning of the year. If you are deciding to use a protector such as these, I recommend purchasing a case such as:  Otterbox Impact Series Silicone Case for iPhone 4 & 4S.",5
"These protectors fit perfectly and the cutouts are clean and accurate. the downside is that they scratch easily, but with quantity, you lose quality. Overall it is a great deal.",3
"they fell off pretty quickly and there were sooo many bubbles even though i used a credit card to apply it with. plus the color of the plastic changed colors, i honestly bought the same product from someone else and got 6 for the same price and theyre much better quality",1
"These are decent screen protectors but there are a few drawbacks about them. First, don't bother applying a snug fitting case. No matter how well you have affixed the protectors to the screen, they will be dug up by the case and fall off. Second, install them quickly. They attract lint at an alarming rate. I won't be buying these again.",2
"excellent item and very inexpensive ,easy to install, ( just follow the instructions as indicated and  you will be fine).",4
"Cheap, good quality, Bought 6 of them, for 2 iphones. Still have 2 left. Doing everything screen protector suppose to do.",5
The screen protector doesn't stick very well over a couple of spots over the screen + it really shows finger marks.,3
considering the fast i still have my back screen protector on since i bought this this thus far may be the best product,5
I was wanting protection on both sides of my phone. This product does its job and yet affordable. Very nice to have on your phone.,5
Although this product has beautiful crystal clear transparent protection it leaves bubbles and they're not reusable unless you want bubbles every time you reuse them... also the screen protector is so think that my cases can push up the sides & conners,1
"this lasted me foreverrrrr i loved it! it was cheap, came fast, and lasted a long time. i was pleased",5
"I feel like I got rippoff. It did not last very long. It actually fell form my phone. Very disapointed. Not getting cheap screen cover from now on. Also getting the damn sticker off is such a pain, and it leaves all the glue on.",2
"don't buy poor quality, yeah yeah i know u will think quality will come with its price. if you want waste ur money, go head!",1
"You cannot beat the price. Moreover, the quality is also fairly good. Easy to install. Just make sure that you clean your phone with lint free cloth and there are no dust particles on the phone.",4
"This product fit better than a screen protector purchased at the ATT store, and I like the 3 front and back screen protectors with microfibre cloths, very handy...  The back protector doesn't seem like something that would be used, but is really nice to have for reassurance that the back of the phone will not be scratched.  I would recommend and order again when I need them.",4
was a good buy if you wanna protect you phone rather then buying a whole case for your iPhone def worth getting,5
"I purchased this from SF Planet - was cheap. Works well, have to be super careful putting it on the phone since its only one. I doubt I would use this again so am not sure what they mean by reusable. Since they are cheap they should really be in at least a double pack in case you mess one up. Overall good buy.",4
These are great screen protecters and look very nice. Easy to put on and don't add any bulk to the size if the phone.,5
"Worked good. Didn't have any problems with them, just a little hard to remove the air bubbles after I installed it.",3
"This iPhone 4s screen protector is really good for the price. It does scratch rather easy, but so worth it instead of the screen of the phone being scratched.",5
I bought this for my iPhone 4 GSM and it fits perfectly on it. The product was brand new and it's a really goot material. The delivery was ok and the package was in almost perfect condition. Totally recommended to the comunity. Thanks.,5
"These worked well, they came quickly and were packaged safely! Loved it so much. They were cheap and easy to use",4
Great. The screen is perfect fit for the Iphone4S. It is very well recommended. I haven't used any other screen protector before this.,5
"The protector went on like any other and it was nice to have the one for the back as well since I am running the phone without a case right now.  It was a BONUS that it ended up being a 3 pack.  I'm not sure if I read that or what, but was surprised when they arrived.",5
"Having purchased VERY inexpensive screen protectors in the past, and having had very good luck with them, I thought I'd try it again with this product. Shipping was over two weeks - I was notified  that the order had been damaged in shipping. When it did finally arrive, there was no packaging. I suspect that the shipping 'damage' is what caused the delivered sheets to be curved, rather than flat, and that may be part of the cause of the issue noted below. But that's not the product's fault.Installing was simple, having done this many times before, but there was not enough 'adhesive' or 'magic' or whatever it is that holds down the edges, so there is a cosmetic problem right off. Again, that might be due to the curvature cause during the shipping damage. I know that the interior bubbles may vanish after several weeks, but the edges simply won't stay down. The product is cut exactly to fit, so you must take time to adjust the fit, but that is a plus as it doesn't leave unprotected glass around the perimeter.As this is my first iPhone, and part of my reason for getting one is the fit and finish of the Apple product [Don't start... I use Android's too!], I am not happy with these screen protectors, at all.Thanks again for playing. Good luck.",2
this is as good as you can get for a dollar less screen protector. definitely no brainer... it protects both front and back. used it for a month now and it doesnt look to fade or worn out like the normal >dollar ones do. good product,5
"Had I read all the other reviews,I would have not made this purchase. First the Product took a month to arrive.There not worth the money or the time it takes to arrive.",2
"This is by far the worst screen protector I have ever purchased. It boasts that it is fingerprint proof and it is the complete OPPOSITE. I think it more-so collects fingerprints and they are very difficult to wipe off instead they just smear across the screen, as if the screen cover is constantly greasy. When the screen is off, you can definitely tell that there is some sort of plastic covering on it as it gives it a very weird sheen. This screen was also much more difficult to apply to my phone than other screen protectors I've used. I usually don't have any problems putting these on and I never get any bubbles but with these it was almost impossible to do it without at least some bubbles. I won't be buying this brand/kind again, complete waste of money/effort.",1
"I hate to be a downer, but this is a pretty bad offering for screen protection.Note: This is my second iPhone - one 3GS and this 4G - and I am very comfortable with all 'accessories'.Here is the breakdown:- By far the hardest glass protector to get 'into place'- Even after the protector is in place, it is impossible to get rid of air bubbles, especially on the rear protector- The material itself is actually quite good - I think it may be the adhesive the manufacturer used- The back protector is worse and is 'puckered' everywhere- Yes, I thoroughly cleaned all surfaces with a high-quality eye glass cleaner - the same one I for my glasses and iPhones reguarlyI had to remove the the front cover because of the bubbles PLUS the fact that two cases were causing the protector to come off:One is the original 'Argyle Lux case' and the other is the 'OtterBox Commuter' case.Don't waste you money on this one, no matter the cost.",2
"These do the job alright, but I also got bubbles under the screen, no matter how careful I was and they seemed to be difficult to get rid of, some I couldnt.",3
Works great. Just as described. I need to buy more. My kid scratches them to quick but this one seems a little more scratch proof than others I've had.,5
"These were so cheap and I absolutely love how they look and feel on my phone. I originally had the zagg screen protector on my phone before, but I hated how it made my screen feel rubbery, and would much rather have no screen protector on. These make my phone feel like it does not have one on at all. There is a pack of three front and three back, so if you mess up it is no big deal. One of them ripped after I had it on for a while, and I do not know what happened, because it was sitting on my lap. But I had two more, so it didn't bother me too much. The first one I had one had a sort of rainbow showing if I held the phone up to the light at a certain angle. But none of the others had that. These are great and so cheap. I will never go back to the zagg's after having these.",5
Needed screen protectors for my iPhone & these did a great job. Easy to apply and protect my screen & back.,5
"I received these covers in the mail yesterday and so far they are working pretty well. I only used the front screen because with the case that I bought, the back screen wouldn't work well with the case that I just purchased. It's not the fault of the screen protector, the case is just tighter. So far I don't see any scratches on the protector, which is what I had a big problem with concerning my older protectors. The air bubbles basically take loads of patience to deal with but that happens with every protector (I suppose). Good product.",4
I ordered these for my husband and I for back up we alread have one.  For the price I highly recommend,4
"These are the cheap kind where if you even have a piece of lint in the air, a giant bubble will from.  So be aware.",3
I bought these for my work phone after I threw the Otterbox my company bought in the trash. It's great for preventing scratches to the front and back of the phone without breaking the wallet.,3
"Of course these thing are hard to put on but, the thing is I thought it was a great Idea to have a front and back screen protector.Yeah, if you don't use a case, why? because from many time of changing my case the back screen protector stop fitting so well. The front one is still intact to this day. The back one just didn't stay that well..OTHERWISE! EXTREMELY GREAT PRICE COMPARED TO STORES.Did take a while to get here simply because it shipped from I think Hong Kong, It was worth it. Very durable!",4
Did not stick and was useless do not recommend  tried everything and still did not work. As they say you get what you pay for junk,1
these are just ok. i love to have them on my phone but could not make them stay on when i used bumpers.,3
yeah ah ah aha ah ah ahaah ahaha ah a ahah aha ah ah aha ah aha ah aha ah,5
"I know a little, how to put screen protector on but this one is not good quality product. You have to work real hard to put it on.",3
"these things just keep slipping off my phone, idk what the problem is but they do not like to stay on at all",3
"It did the job, and really protected my device.  Eventually, I had to replace it, but for the cost and how long I was able to keep it on, it is worth the money spent.",3
"I have a many things to say about this, and one of them is DO NOT BUY THIS, i buy this and never came, so ba carefull, do not buy it",1
Installed with NO bubbles. I'm happy! I had to wait a while for delivery but am very happy with the result-perfectly aligned and bubble free. Combined with an Otterbox 'Commuter' phone case has my new Iphone totally protected.,5
"these were great. i barely opened the 2nd one and it's working just fine. short, sweet, and to the point. i like this (:",4
"These are top quality protection for your investment. And they are simple to put on, I change mine about every 3 months, and my iPhone is VERY high use.",5
"Good screen protection. Takes patience to patience to  correctly on phone screen.  Bubbles were difficult to remove, but I was able to get rid of most of the bubbles.",3
Would get this. I liked it. I would get it. This did do its job till I needed a new one get it.,5
I love that this bring a screen protector for the back of the phone! My case recently broke and I have had to use my phone and this has saved it from getting the back all nasty and scrathed up. Highly recommend.,5
"so i ordered it and ended up not needing it, but oh well guess i now have plenty of back ups for when the one i currently have gets messed up.",3
I love this product. this is really cheap and good quality screen protectors. I use this almost for a month,5
"I love it, It's totally keeps my phone from finger smuges and scratches I can't beleiev I got it for this price!!!",5
it works well...i have a iphone 4s an need to put my sim in another phone for work...so i dont damage my iphone 4s...an it does the job well,4
I like to have something that will fit the standard smartphone with standard SIM CARD.  Excellent but I lost it - very tiny.,5
"This is too soft, destroyed the pins in my Infuse. luckily I have new phones.I don't know what else I can do. I feel so helpless and stupid when this wouldn'trelease without bending the pins.",1
"gets stuck in your sim tray when the sim pops out of the adapter while trying to remove the sim w/adapter from your phone/device and you are screwed unless you know how to remove it without damaging the sim tray and prongs.this is crap and will only cause problems. I had to carefully using a utility knife to carefully lift the sim tray cover and coax this horrible piece of junk out of my phone and threw it right into the garbage, couldn't be bothered returning it.get yourself a noosy sim cutter and use the outer part of your sim cards housing the noosy kept inside after popping out the micro sim and use the housing left over as its natural adapter,. (see my uploaded pictures on howI used the noosy and my sim cards outer trim as its natural adapter)this adapter is horrible quality....bottom line.if you already have a micro sim and dont have to go from standard sim to micro, what ever you do stay away from this crap.This junk and almost ruined my sim tray prongs.WILL RUIN YOUR SIM TRAY, STAY AWAY",1
I wish I had bought more of these. Work great for turning your MicroSIM into a regular or normal sized SIM,5
I bought this to put my micro SIM card in a full size sim slot. My adaptor was supple and not brittle.,4
works great and fits both iphone and regular! i love it and will get another soon! easy set up...and works worldwide!,5
I was expecting that the chip does have a number but with that I got the update off ios5 so it was fine.,3
"The actually card itself did not work, but I went to at&t and got a new card for free. It wasn't that big of a deal.",3
"The item worked perfectly and came before it was scheduled to arrive!! Would recommend to anyone!! There were a few different chips, just read which one would be perfect for the phone I had!",5
We will definetly purchase again. Everything was quick and easy to set up no problem. Thanks so much!..Love it!! Love  it!!,5
i can use this as soon as i get another cell phoneand so am going to be useing this soon.,5
Bought the micro sim card and activated it with AT&T; and added $15 credit so I could make calls. Once the micro sim card had been activated by AT&T; plus the $15 credit on my Unlocked Iphone 4g which read Sim Failure & Invalid Sim.They would not reimburse the $15 AT&T; credit or send a new micro sim card. A BIG RIP OFF!!!,1
"does not work on iphone 4s, reads sim failure, no sim. went to the at&t store and they cant even get it to work. dont waste your time, go directly to at&t and get one thru them.",1
I always wanted an iphone but i did not want to be on a two year contract so i bought the iphone off of amazon and ordered this sim card. the sim card came before my phone so i was able to activate and I selected the $25 a month plan on my phone. The only thing that i had to do was trim it a little bit but everything turned out great.,5
This was a piece of junk. I ended up going to AT&T to purchase SIM card. Which cost me nothing!,1
Works great with a gophone plan for iPhone.  I popped it right into my iPhone 4 and registered with gophone and BAM!  It works.  It's a great way to use a pre-paid plan for an iPhone.,5
I bought this for my son's iphone4 and work perfect from the begining. Just remember to activate using 15 &#34;zero&#34; where asking for IMEI of the phone.,5
"Works fine... card was new as promised, no problem with activation. Fits in  my unlocked Iphone. Just wish more money was on initial load.",4
If you are using this to try and change APN settings on an iPhone it works perfectly. By the way this works with locked iPhones as well you just have to be quick to get to the apn section.,5
"I have had success with the full size SIM card. These are a great value for folks looking to move to T-Mobile. I specifically used this for the Monthly 4G pre-paid service that T-Mobile offers. It's a great value.Activation was really easy, although I did have to call in to have my number ported over, as the activation process didn't allow for a port-in request. No problem though. I just called them and they took care of it.*FYI* if you are trying to port in your Google Voice number, it will take anywhere from 3-5 business days to get your number ported since it is considered a 'land-line' and has to go through a different dept, than typical mobile number port-ins do.",5
I bought this for my mom and it works great. She needed it for a t mobile phone I gave her. It isn the fastest phone but it is a touch phone It works great. Price was cheap!,5
"(Note:  I edited the review after I used the SIM for a while.  I had initially thought it would connect to 3G but the fact that it won't is noted in the product description.  Sorry about that.)Hey folks, I ordered this SIM card in the hopes of using it at Bonnaroo, a huge music festival held near my hometown every year.  Thousands of people take their AT&T; IPhones to this festival, causing the cell towers to overload so badly they won't work.  I've learned to bring a phone with a prepaid SIM card along for texting my friends to coordinate plans.  So far this one's had its ups and downs...* The card arrived quickly and without incident.  Activating the card was fairly easy.  I was able to do that online using only the card's ID number, the phone number, and my phone's serial number.  However, I couldn't place calls right away because I can't get a signal on it at my house (about ten miles outside downtown Nashville, TN).  It seems to work in downtown Nashville, with the Edge network on my unlocked IPhone 3G.* I was unable to register for an online account in order to manage my minutes or find out details about my rate plan.  As a condition to create the account, T-Mobile sends a text message with a temporary password to your phone and you're required to enter this password.  Since I can't get a signal at all at my home, I'm unable to receive text messages.  I called T-Mobile to ask to have this temporary password emailed instead (I was required to provide an email address and received an email confirming my registration of the SIM card, so I know they have my email address associated with my account.)  However, the account rep insisted they don't have the ability to email me a password.  I wound up grabbing the password the next time I went downtown, but it seems sort of absurd that they can't just email you the darn thing.Upshot:  This is a fairly cheap option if you need a SIM card for a one-off, like a trip to another city.  I was able to get a signal pretty easily near Nashville but it didn't do so well in rural areas.  Also, I couldn't get it to work either at Bonnaroo or at another 50,000 person concert in June, so don't rely on it for that purpose.  But basically you can hear well using T-Mobile, it's easy to change your service plan once you're able to log into your account and I think the price tiers are fairly reasonable.  I'd probably buy this again.",3
Great back up to have in case u want to go abroad and not pay ur carriers ridiculous roaming Fees!!! Get this alas well as the sim cutter and the 'Gevey Ultra Sim adapter' u can unlock ur phone in a blink of an eye. I used apple&berry and they were perfect fast shipping and not the Rey one. :he ultra one. That way you don't gave to flip airplane mode on and the Orr and dia a bunch of numbers. Just pop in the Gevey ultra tray with ur tmobile sim or fodaphone etc and reboot and ur unlocked!!,5
"Was ok.  You only get 2g with most phones on the tmobile network as I have found out.  I don't think this was a good deal or bad deal.  Provides you with 10 free minutes of calling.  May be good to keep in the car if your other plan doesn't work, but it does have an expiration date on it (like 2 years).",3
this sim card refers to a prepaid credit of less than $4 and you are then switched to their postpaid plan which requires a call to cancel or you will be charge after you quit using your phone/plan,1
"Purchased from ABE-123. Sim & activation card arrived in a timely manner.I was able to sign up for T-Mobile's so-called 'Wal-Mart' plan in just a few minutes.Very good.There was no problem with the product I got from ABE-123 whatsoever.Now, whether T-Mobile is a good data operator is another story.;)",5
This T-mobile prepaid sim was my perfect travel companion during our vacation with my family.....I would buy more for future trips!!!,5
"I have an unlocked iPhone 3G and while the minutes are more expensive than with a contract, and because I don't use the phone for a great number of calls or texts, this is a terrific money-saver for me.  I have a number of sim cards from all over the US and Europe, and I just have to pop one into the phone and I'm good to go.  What could be better?",5
"I picked this up because it was dirt cheap compared to other outlets, and in particular I picked it up in hopes of being able to use it for the web exclusive of the 30$ plan. Of which other sites like Walmart said you had to use there specific sim which was bull.Bought this kit which was more than half off from other retailers went to Tmobile and signed up with new non contract web exclusive and popped it into my galaxy nexus and works great, no issues and no troubles.I would recommend using this. Really worthitFast delivery too",5
"after i activated my sim card i made about 50 Cent,  so i made money buying this sim card. i will be buy more of these activation kit.  delivered very fast, may 4 days from time i order item.",5
"Easy to setup via their website. Easy to add time to account- credit/debit cards, checking account or pre-purchased refill cards from retails stores (i.e. Walmart) and even the option of recurring payment.The downside is that it automatically signs you up for marketing phone calls, which I think costs you money!!! What's up with that?When I created a T-Mobile account (not needed to get it going initially), I found an option to opt out of it, but that it might take 10 days to take place.That is very bad business practice on T-Mobile's account!Otherwise, they work as advertised.I'm only in the states for the summer, so they work for us.",4
I NEED ED THIS FOR MY PREPAID CELL PHONE AND TO SEE IF I COULD GET THE SAME PHONE NUMBER OR A DIFFERENT CELL PHONE NUMBER.,5
It was the wrong SIM card for the phone. The phone has an embedded SIM card in it that is wired to the phone so you cannot use another carier. The carrier who had the phone made this way is Virgin Mobile.,4
This is exactly what you would get directly from T-Mobile but for a whole lot less money.  Well worth the cost and ships quick.  Obviously price has gone up since I bought this though but still a pretty good value.,5
It is just what I needed. It will work with my new smart phone. The price is great also .,5
My t mobile phone dont read the sim card it dose not work i guess so i wouldn't suggest buying this,1
I recently converted both my phones from ATT to TMobile Prepaid service. Instead of paying ATT $120+ my bill has reduced dramatically and call quality is just awesome. TMobile has several plans ranging from just data to just minutes and you can change as you wish. My number porting from ATT was automatic and done through their website. TMobile is really coming up back from ashes. I was using them during 2003-2008 and then moved to ATT. Now I am back to Tmobile thanks to their great prepaid plans.I had cut a regular SIM for microSIM purpose and have done the reverse also. There are regular SIM card adapters to put micro SIM in.,5
"Ported my number from Quest Landline>------>T-Mobile Prepaid>-------->Google VoiceThe entire process was very easy! I had a spare unlocked phone on hand and used this sim card with it. If you want to do the same just 'Google Port Landline to Google voice'. Now I don't have to pay $30/month to have incoming calls, because I never used my landline to make outgoing calls at all. I get to keep my number and save money.",5
I received a micro-SIM card when what I ordered was a regular SIM card. My seller was Beetree Marketing. I'm not going to initiate a return for a $7.75 purchase - it's not worth my time. There was also no 'starter credit' as stated in the item photo.,1
"I was outside of the T-Mobile signal area, so I had to go into town to activate this sim card.  It worked as described and $3.34 was automatically added to it as soon as it was activated.  My card had an &#34;activate by date&#34; of April 2013.  I haven't added a funding card on it yet, and will probably do a pay as you go day to day plan while traveling.  I have no issues with this card, and would recommend it.  I know some folks get this Sim Card from the T-Mobile website for free sometimes, but I could never get any of my credit cards to work on that site, so I just purchased it from here frustration free.",5
I would recommend this for anyone with an unlocked GSM smartphone that doesn't talk very much on the phone and has decent T-Mobile coverage in their area. Does that describe you? Then get one of these and go to the walmart online shop! Quit asking questions and quit wondering if it'll work!,5
"I just needed the activation code so I could activate my iphone 5 online and get the T-Mobile $30 a month plan (people, this plan is awesome). I'm happy and it came early.",5
I ordered this sim card for my Blackberry because I didn't want a two year contract with a phone company anymore.  It arrived promptly.  I waited a couple of weeks because I wanted to port my telephone number from my old phone.  When I was ready to use it I followed the directions that came with the card and went to the website to activate it and the product worked as stated.  I was disappointed that they assigned me a telephone number and I wasn't allowed to port my old number but I can live with that.  I thought I would be able to pay $50 and get the unlimited plan but you must use a credit card or your checking account for that and that was not an option for me.  I selected the $30 plan for 1500 minutes or texts.  This way I can buy a top up card when my minutes run out.  I will make this my back up phone because I still want to port my old telephone number so I guess I will buy a StraitTalk phone from Walmart.  They allow you to  keep your old telephone number if you want to.T-Mobile just likes to make things difficult.  Thats just my opinion. The sim card worked as expected but I am not giving it a five star simply because the options you get from T-Mobile limited my choices of plans.,3
"With this prepaid account. I bought a iPhone 5S and used for more than 40 days. When I tried to call them to unlock my iPhone 5s, their customer service from the Philippines told me that I have to use the phone for 40 days to unlock it. So I waited and called in again yesterday, the guy told me that I met all the criteria and will submit the request again. So today I received the email saying that they still cannot unlock because I do not meet their criteria.I called them, their s-called customer service from the philippines spend almost an hour on the phone.",1
"So what more is there to say? It is a battery, and it works just as if i would have bought it from the cell company.",5
it's working fine...it's not swelling up like my last battery did and it holds a decent charge so I'm pleased with the product.,3
"The battery I recieved had 0 volts and would not take a charge.The price was excellent but these are old shelved battery bargains sometimes, and once a lithium battery gets below a certain voltage it chemically changes progressively from much less capacity all the way down to no capacity like mine was.I gave the battery a 3 because I'm sure that like the one already in my phone it does a fine job, when it still is chemically viable.I just wanted to warn that it's better to pay a few bucks more and get one that has been made within the last 3 years or so. I think mine was probably the better part of 5-7 years to have achieved 0 voltage and 0 performance.I don't mind Companies buying lots of older batteries and selling them at bargain prices, but they should test them to make sure they have not degraded.Yes, I know I am reviewing the battery not the Company, but I must say even the battery in my phone seems hungry all the time although it may just be my phones nanny software being over-protective.",3
Happy. Always keep them charged and already help when original battery went dead on the brush. Luckly I had battery as back up and was able to still make contact with people around the area for communication and directions. Very happy with battery and for the price compared at $45 at retail.,5
Ordered this battery for my son's Samsung Replenish.  Worked great right out of the package!.  Price was just a bit over $6 and the shipping was fast! 3 days earlier than the promised date range on the order confirmation. There was a bit cheaper priced battery on Amazon but the project delivery was 4 weeks from the order date.  I received this in 3 days via USPS.  Glad I paid a few more pennies for a much quicker delivery.  I will buy more seeing that I have 3 other phones using the same battery.,5
I don't have these batteries no more or the phones. the Batteries worked well in the phones without a problem. Great product,5
I bought this to fit a us cellular samsung galaxy. It wouldn't work with the phone. They may have been my fault though.,1
"It works great , takes charge wellIt is a great back up time to have.Works great on phone",3
"When I received this battery it came in packaging as if someone just sold me some old battery they didn't want anymore.  It looks a little different from the battery that came with my phone as well (Epic 4G) despite many of the similarities.  After fully charging the battery, it didn't take very long to drain it to critical (about 3 hours or so) which was the very reason why I decided to get a &#34;new&#34; battery.  Whether this is an issue with my phone, I cannot be sure.  What I DO know, is that it did not perform the way I would expect a new battery to perform.  Coupled with my suspicions as to whether or not the battery is truly an authentic Samsung product, I might consider buying this particular battery elsewhere if possible.",2
This battery replacement is perfect. it lasts long and does what it's supposed to do as I expected. Very cool.,5
"You don't have to spend a fortune on batteries for your phone! Almost free compared to retail stores! Thank you, 'The Battery Eater'",5
"I got this battery to replace the one in my Samsung Captivate SGH-I897. I ordered it from BTO, Inc from Amazon.com, with free shipping.The battery I received from BTO, Inc looks almost identical to the one that came with my phone, but there were subtle differences in the case. After examining the label, I noticed the one from BTO was Made in China. The one that came with my phone was Made in Korea. Since this battery is listed as OEM, I expected it to be identical to the one that came with my phone. Not sure if there's much of a quality difference between the original and this one, as both seem to hold a similar amount of charge. I've been using it for a couple of months with no problems so far.For the price, the battery is fine. It holds a much better charge than a third party generic battery I purchased.",3
I needed a new battery and never thought to look on here. I a so glad someone told me to look here. This keeps my phone charged so much longer then my old battery.,5
I bought this for my Epic 4G. It fits and works. Not really much to say about that.Why I'm writing this review: This battery also works in the Epic 4G Touch. It does have slightly less power than the one that ships with the Epic 4G Touch and it's a tight fit unless you remove the plastic cap from the bottom side opposite the terminals.,5
The battery I received must have been on the shelf for a while because it would only hold a charge for 3 to 4 hours or so.  I have a newer phone now that doesn't suck battery power...but I bought this battery to carry as an extra because the Samsung Epic 4g had horrible battery life.,1
battery was very handy. fit my phone and keeps better charge. looking for battery is hard but was very pleased with it,5
Received battery. It was exactly what i ordered. I will use it as my back-up battery.You can not go wrong with such a good price,4
"Let me first start off by reviewing this battery.  In my Samsung Captivate with Serendipity 7 custom rom installed I have plenty of widgets but the battery will last a full day plus some.  Since i have had my phone for around 5 months, the battery now last around 10 hours.  So I am replacing my old battery (i currently have two, a new one and one that came with a Samsung charger stand I purchased) that originally came with my phone.Like another reviewer stated, I received a EB575152VU instead of a EB575152VA.  It was packaged in a plastic bag, and it had a newer date on the battery (May 2011). The battery looked like a real samsung battery, just the wrong model number. The battery's white water damage indicator was showing xxxxx across the top indicating that the battery was damaged due to water.  However i figured that it was re-manufactured so I tried out the battery and it does work on my captivate, however the battery will not charge through the phone!  the phone will shutoff if you even try to charge it.  Since i can't charge it, ended up returning the battery.My order was through Alpha INC. who has recently changed their names to Emerald LLC.  It was fulfilled through Amazon so please do NOT buy from Alpha or Emerald!  Amazon of course was helpful in getting a refund.  Their advice for finding a real samsung battery was to try out another seller... lol.  I ended up just getting this off ebay, but these batteries are only $30 from Samsung's official store.Conclusion: Be careful who you order from, and make sure it is NOT Alpha INC. or Emerald LLC.  Good luck!",4
"The product came to me late, had some charge on it . Charged but it easily goes down with talk time",3
"Samsung Epic 4G SPH-D700 Captivate i897 i9000 Galaxy Vibrant T959 Focus I917 Cetus EB575152VA BSTD Li-Ion OEM Cell Phone Battery (1500 mAh)this is not the item you will recieve if you order this product. the item number in the description & picture is accurate but the seller i ordered from does not ship this item out. they &lt;majicmobile>(along with numerous other sellers on amazon & ebay) are shipping a similar, cheaper battery that is a different part number and is known for having reliability issues. you want the battery with the 'a' at the end, not a 'u' in the part number. also notice in the picture the battery has 'g9' (wich is original manufacturer), yet the one shipped is 'g7'. this is the HK version with a samsung sticker on it. it is NOT an OEM Samsung Vibrant (along with other models) battery. it fits but performs terribly & does not last long. its an honest shame this practice has moved to amazon.com, as its very common on ebay. please research your items, be sure your getting exactly what you order! youll find the shipping is higher than the actual item price so when you return it you end up loosing the larger portion of your cost making the return an unfortunate loss of you hard earned money!",1
"AWFUL, Would have given it a ZERO, but that is not an option... the label looks like a pre-schooler put it on with elmers glue as a class project.  The batteries are practically falling apart, the ends and top flexing away the the cheap crap cell... they will NOT charge in the Epic phone - gives a 'Battery Not Compatible' error if plugged with the USB into a computer - so it will not charge or allow connection to the phone on the computer... they will only charge in a separate wall charger I have and the charge last only a few hours and drops from what looks like 80% to 'Please replace battery' in a matter of minutes... DO NOT PURCHASE THESE CHEAP AFTER MARKET PIECES OF CRAP... should have known this from the price, but I have bought other batteries for other phones from here and had reasonable success - they may not have been as good as the original in the phone, but they did charge and were of high quality... I have batteries for my son's EVO, my daughters LG Optimus and my old Palm Pre and was satisfied... BUT THESE SAMSUNG BATTERIES WITH THERE FAKE SAMSUNG LABELS ARE CHEAP KNOCK OFFS AND DO NOT PERFORM... SAVE YOUR TIME AND GO ORDER A REAL SAMSUNG BATTERY FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE.  I found a genuine Samsung standard battery for $29.99 including free shipping which was a great deal comparged to the regular price and worth the price because it actually works.",1
This battery performs as good if not better than the one that came with my Captivate.  Always good to have a spare battery as a phone that can do everything needs a lot of power.  Glad it was a real Samsung battery and not a cheaply made knock off.,5
"Based on the many reviews for this product, it might be difficult to decide if you want to buy it or not.  I took the risk and went for it.  The battery fit my Samsung Focus perfectly.  It charged right up and has been going for four strong months now.  Mine was purchased through Amazon (and not a fulfillment).  Those giving poor reviews need to provide additional information, because clearly there are good batteries being sold.",5
Ok replacement battery for my daughters Galaxy S phone. Works and charges fine. Haven't had any issues with it at all.,4
I used it for quite some time and it's pretty good.  HOwever it does take a lot longer to charge it than my original phone one.,4
Bought this battery as it appeared to be an orginal.got it in and put in my wife's Samsung Vibrant.Plugged it into charger and then I noticed the phone was off.tried to turn the phone on and it would NOT turn on.Pulled out the charger and THEN the phone would turn on.Put the old ORIGINAL battery back in and it all worked fine (phone would come on when on charger) so clearly the replacement battery is defunct.Repeated this process several times just to be sure and each and every time the phone would not come on when the battery was in and the charger was on.Returned item.,1
This battery works very well.  The original battery was not holding a charge and it was either get a new battery or a new phone.  She liked the phone so we got a battery and now she is very happy.,5
I could not afford a new phone but this battery was a breath of freshness to my Samsung Galaxy after 2.5years of use.  It is like new now!,5
"Purchased two batteries, one for my phone and one for my wife's.  Over the past two months they have worked just as good if not better then our year old original Samsung batteries.  The only difference that I noticed was the sticker that wraps the battery, on the original batteries the bottom portion of the sticker is black, where on these it is all silver...nothing that really matters.  If either of the batteries decides to crap out on us I'll update my review but I've held off this long to make sure, and so far so good.  Mine were purchased through amazon, sold by: Justwirelessoutlet",5
I purchased two of these batteries because I like to have all my settings set to the max. I like my screen set to the brightest because the Super AMOLED shows off at its best in the brightest settings. Having a couple of these to back up my indulgences makes being a show off easy while on the go.,5
"This OEM battery can perform as good as the original battery coming with Captivate, providing uninterrupt power for the phone more than 1 day, it would be perfect if coming with a battery charger.Beware of another seller's '2 battery + charger combo', the battery only provide 6 hrs 'standby' power for Cativate.I got both items in one week.",5
"Aside from a little rattle when empty and fully open, I'm pleased with the functionality and ease of use for this product. The slight rattle is easily abated by clicking the sides in one or two notches when the phone is not in the cradle. Nice product for the money and works very well with phones that are in cases.",4
"This is basically a perfect design.Don't trust the sticky tape.use the screws.Pre-drill the holes, and you will have a long lasting mount.",5
"I owned this a month before part of the mount disintegrated.  Keep in mind that the phone basically sat in this cradle untouched, other than removing and placing it back in the mount.  It barely survived the trip down to South Carolina and back.What's worse is the warranty--90 days, and you have to basically pay them an unusually high fee to return and replace it.  In essence, you are buying a new one at cost.  This is NOT standing behind the sale--this is IMHO a bit dishonest for something that can't stand up to normal usage in a car.  While it worked, it worked great...but the plastic is not durable.Product fail.  One star.",1
"I originally bought this to mount my HTC EVO 4G to the dash of my Peterbilt. Now it secures my Samsung Galaxy Note 2, with a massive extended battery that doubles the weight and thickness of the phone. I've noticed that one or more reviewers have complained that the adjusting mechanism eventually failed. I haven't had that problem at all, and I have to squeeze the jaws very tight to keep my very large and very heavy phone from bouncing out while driving down the road (remember, I'm using this is a Peterbilt, so it's a very rough ride compared to a passenger car).I have had two issues with this cradle, and both problems are probably unique to my application of the device. Problem number one is that theZeroLemon 9300mAh Extended Batterymakes my phone so thick that it has a problem staying in the cradle. It occasionally bounces off the two little feet that the phone sits on. This shouldn't be a problem for most people, as the battery I'm using is pretty extreme in size, and it wasn't a problem before I upgraded to the monstrous battery. Problem number two is that the swivelling arm that attaches the cradle to the base keeps breaking. This problem got worse with the addition of the extended battery. I'm using this cradle to mount the heaviest and largest phone out there to the dashboard of a Peterbilt. After nearly twenty years in trucking, I've learned to expect the early failure of anything that resides in my truck (not specifically built for the purpose). The ride of a truck is much harsher than that of a car, and I put about 120,000 miles a year on it. If something fails in my truck after six months, that's like it lasting six years or more in a passenger car. I'm having the arms made out of aluminum and that will forever fix the broken arm issue; and I'm having aluminum feet made that are a little longer and have a lip on the end to eliminate the problem of the phone falling out of the cradle.Despite the issues I'm having with this cradle, I still feel it deserves at least four stars. The problems I'm encountering won't be an issue for most people, and if they are, then you're probably asking too much from the thing like I am.",4
"I've used an Arkon windshield mount on my car for some years, but in the winter I constantly have to reattach it to the windshield.  This is inherent in suction cups, cold, etc.  Various tricks can improve it, but it's just going to happen and I'm afraid one day it's going to fall with my phone in it and break it.  Good product, just doesn't work well in the winter.So I grabbed this for a more sturdy mount and I had no idea how adjustable it is.  The base rotates, the angle rotates, the holder rotates.  You can get this thing any way you want.  As long as you have a flat spot about 2x2&#34; you can mount this thing and it'll be super sturdy.",5
great product as always easy packaging well made product and works as advertised.I would highly recommend this for anyone with iphone 5,5
"This clips on without much difficulty, and more importantly stays put and is not a bear to remove.  It doesn't rattle while driving.  I love the ability to move the mount around to get the right angle and to tilt it up when first putting my phone in, so that it stays while I use the same hand to close the clamps to keep the phone in place.  The phone stays stable in the clamps and it doesn't shudder while driving, so reading my phone as navigation is smooth and reliable.  Oh, and I also love that it uses two well spaced prongs at the bottom, leaving a hole to plug in a cord for charging the phone.",5
"won't stay in vent slots - if it did it would be great - the clips are very very stiff and hard to open long enough to slip on the vents, then if you bump it just wrong it goes flying - Recommend foam non-slip clips and a click open/shut (like the sunglasses holder that goes on the visor) instead of manual force-open  - then I would love it.  One important aspect for me was that my phone would be within reach if I had a wreck, and not thrown somewhere in my SUV - as it is now - that is not possible.  Clips need revised.",1
"At first I was skeptical buying this because usually you get what you pay for but this car vent mount is more than just decent. It's well made and study, it's adjustable so that you can tilt it towards you while you are driving. I have the Samsung note 3, which is a large phone and it's fits comfortably inside this mount with no slipping or anything. You can't beat this price! Plus, it holds securely in the vents even with a phone in place while you drive, there's no movement with it at all. You'll be pleased with this purchase.",5
"I used this for my Google Nexus (i9250-SMNG) in my civic. I bought it to have my phone visible while driving and for GPS function.  The clips are hard to press but once you have it in place its good.  Though it is not very stable but it is usable.  I found it easier to place on vents first and then assemble the holder, otherwise it is difficult to place the clips on the vents.",4
"I am liking this phone holder. It holds onto the air vent very well, and have no signs of breaking yet.I have owned 3 bracketrons in the past, and the thing that holds onto the airvent always snapped.This one is like a clamp that clamps onto the airvent.I gave it 4 stars because the swivel is a pain to use, so I just tighten it all the way and keep it in upright position.Fit my galaxy s3 very well.",4
"I bought this mainly for my son to watch his cartoon in the car when were driving, And it works great, my son watches netflix everytime were on the road. So hes happy Im happy!!!",5
"I had an air vent mount before this one and I loved it.  (It was made by BELL).  However, an oversized box bumped it in my car and it broke.  I tried replacing the old one with this, and it was terrible.  I think the problem lies in the clasps that grasp the air vent.  The old unit had threaded clasps with plastic nuts that would tighten around the air vent.  On this mount, the clasps have weak hooks inside that don't hold anything.  It would flop around constantly.  The part that connects the phone holder to the air vent mount is poorly made, too.  You can't move your phone from vertical to horizontal position without using both hands.  Yikes.After one week of trying to make this work, I returned it to Amazon and purchased the Mountek CD-player mount.  I've had that one for two weeks and it is MUCH, MUCH better.  After trying several mounts, it is the best.",1
"This mount worked great as long as it remained mounted on the vent. However, sharp turns and bumps in the road often sent it flying. This morning it fell off the vent when I went over a bump in an intersection and fell in front of my gas pedal. Cars were heading for me but I couldn't accelerate out of the way because the pedal was blocked by the mount. I had to reach down and move it out of the way so I could accelerate out of the path of oncoming traffic.Scary.After pulling it off the floor I saw that one of the clips was broken (the clips are all plastic). The clip probably broke when the mount was underfoot.** Being all plastic, the clips simply don't have enough tension to hold to the vent blades in city traffic. **If Arkon improves the clips this would easily become my favorite vehicle phone mount.",2
"I much prefer clip on phone holder over those suction types and this item serve the purpose. The clips maybe a bit iffy, but once you installed it try not to mess with it to often. I was concerned about the garmin attachments, but it held out find. I would recommend this. Shipping was good on time properly packaged.",4
This Air Vent Car Mount Holder for iPhone 5 Samsung Galaxy S4 S3/SIII Note works fine. I have a few of them for each of the family members.,3
Awesome.  Works well and is sturdy. Can fit just about any size phone or small 7 inch tablet like an ipad mini or nexus 7. Feels really secure while driving. Would definitely recommend it.,5
"This is my second try in the same number of days.  First one I got was the one with the lights that flash when a phone call comes in - but they were problematic and would go off all the time, not just when a phone call came in.  Even my garage door opener made them go off.  So I got this, a vent mount only, since I didn't need all the rest of the mounting options.  I wanted it on my vent.The one I returned had one great feature this one doesn't - a nice, quiet, slow opening when you push the button to open the arms.  The other one opened as if it was hydraulically operated.  Slow, smooth, quiet.  This one is a LOUD 'snap!' as it just pops to full position loudly.  That's the only reason I took off a star.It holds very tightly on my 2012 Nissan Juke, doesn't bounce unless a really rough road.  The ball clamp on back tightens very well, and keeps the phone in the position desired, even holding it securely to button presses while it's mounted.  The feet are wide enough to allow my iPhone 4s to have the charging cable connected while it's in here (which is the whole reason I wanted one - to charge the phone while I drove without having it laying in the center console somewhere or using a cup holder to set it in).Clamps and holds securely, the pads will hold it tight and wouldn't be depressing buttons on the sides if your device has buttons lower.The alligator type clamps on top are movable - you can move them closer together or all the way out to the edge, so you have some wiggle room for smaller vents if needed, unlike some models that have them fixed at the widest point.Works great, very subdued compared to the garish lit one I tried first.  I'm happy with this purchase.Edit 6 months later - I had to take it out today, and will look for a replacement.  The clips just will not hold onto the vent pieces anymore.  There's nothing evident anywhere for damage, no cracks, no whitish plastic showing something bent too far but didn't quite break, everything seems just as it always did - but the alligator clips will no longer hold it securely, even though they appear to be just as closed and have just as much tension as before.  No matter how I try to get it in there now, it flops right out and throws itself and my phone on the floor at the slightest glance at it or sneeze...  So I've dropped it from the 4 stars I thought it earned initially to just two.  It wasn't expensive, but anything should be usable for more than 6 months...",2
"Holds my phone at the perfect level, same as other dashboard gauges. My phone isn't on top of my dash, obscuring my view.",5
"This vent mount fits to Nissan Altima 2012 model firmly and holds my and my wife's phone. But iPhone 5 has headphone jack at the bottom and when you hook your phone to the mount, you can not connect aux cable. It works great for Samsung S3 though.",3
The hooks broken while carefully trying to move it to a different high on the dashboard. I'm currently looking for something else.,1
I needed something to put my phone on when I'm driving and I happened to see this and I went ahead and ordered it. When I got it in the mail I started to put it together and that was super simple. Now it's in the car being used...,5
This mount is pretty universal but it just doest fit any part of my sonata 2012. I think it wont fit any of the sonata 2011-2014 since all of them have a very similar dash board design.Not really the manufactuter fault but they should have put in the list of cars this wont fit. That is what the reduced points are for. I used it in a rental car for a week and it worked fine there.,3
"Short review for a crappy product:Pros - the holder for the phone fits well and is adjustable so that is a strong plusCons - the mounts for the air vent simply cannot hold.  Take a turn - the whole thing goes shooting off into the driver or passenger side foot area.  Accelerate sharply?  Watch this go flying into the back seat.You have the same security if you just left your phone on the dashboard - if you don't turn or accelerate sharply, then no problems.Blech",1
"Works well, feels a little cheap on some of it like the release for the lock. spring prob wont last too long but have to wait and see. Somewhat bulky too, the previous one i had was slimmer but that one did break after 8 months of use.hopefully this one will last a year or so.",4
"This one is cheap and does its job OK. It will definitely hold different sized smartphones due to the adjustable sides, although the &#34;feet&#34; are not as fancy as in other holders I've seen. On this model you can take them off by sliding them out (and then try not to lose them), otherwise you're either going to use the holder in portrait mode or live with a large phone having the left side stick out when oriented landscape. The air vent mount is complete junk; I fiddled with it for hours and could never get it to mount solidly. Maybe this isn't the holder's fault exactly (I doubt air vents are anywhere near universal) but it may impact your use of the mount. I got around this by removing the windshield mount from an old GPS holder and inserted it into this one. Luckily it fit and I was able to continue using this mount, otherwise I probably would have returned it.",3
"...it's wobbly. Bounced around the vent, doesn't really have a tight hold on the vent. The actual phone part has a great grip, but eventually the bouncing just annoyed me enough to just toss it into a box to forget about it...",4
works well in my Honda Odyssey however did not work well in my Tundra truckbefore you purchase make sure that you have enough room from the vent and that nothing will obstruct it - whereas in my tundra the transmission shift was in the way and any other  vent was to far away.,4
This was so stupid it would not fit on my air vents as designed and would not stay on to hold a phone.  I only wish I would have sent it back but it seemed like to much hassle for the price.,1
The vent clips broke kind of easily and there seems to be some fit problems attaching it to the phone holder. But the manufacturer was very helpful and courteous and shipped me replacement vent clips without delays. Excellent customer service. Hope I can say the same with the product.,3
"Have only had for a couple of days but so far I really love it!! 01 olds silhouette minivan. Helps keep my phone where I can see the GPS safely and also use speaker phone, everyone can hear me clearly now instead of when the phone rested way down in the cup holder. Love it, just hope it lasts.",5
"This arrived today and is perfect for what I need it for.  Its a lot sturdier than I expected.  The padding is a nice touch and there is no sag in it when its hanging from the vent.  A lot of times these will have that sag as they hang from the vent, howeverrrrrrr, this ones great.Very pleased with this purchase. Well made and arrived on time, as usual.Highly recommend this for those who need something to use in the car to extend the phone or GPS.Its much better than the pads used to lay on the dash board.  You can adjust your equipment so you can glance over and look at your phone, GPS or whatever item is in use. Again, highly useful and recommended.UPDATE... This unit only expands wide enough to hold my HTC phone. It does not open wide enough to use my GPS unit in it, which is a TOM TOM.",5
"Okay, there's nothing wrong with this product at all. It works completely fine.I use it between my Samsung Focus and my iPhone 4 all the time.My problem with this product is that the template is just a sheet of paper.I understand that it's a dollar, and it's just temporary...but the paper as a template isn't really an effective way of cutting a sim card.I was thinking of using the template to cut a friend's sim card to use with my iPhone...but as a sheet of paper it's not a very useful template.The adapter, however works just fine and as advertised so I feel like this product still deserves a high score.I just wish the template wasn't such a 'cop out'.",4
"I had wondered about these due to some of the reviews.  But it fits perfectly.  Took 16 days to get to me in California, which is fine considering it was less than a buck with no shipping cost.The pictures show a slight tab in two corners of the opening. The one I received did not, however that is maybe why people said they were too thick before.  Physically has to be to be thicker to have the tabs and also fit the sim.  Fitting flush and the same thickness as a sim is what you want to be most compatible.Mine is the same thickness as a sim card with no tabs, and my micro sim fits snuggly in the hole and is absolutely flush with the top and bottom.  The stickers that come with it can be used to keep it in and smooth on top.  Although it is tight enough that I think I could slide it in and out just fine without a sticker.  I used scotch tape and trimmed around to try it out and will use the sticker if I need to use it for a long period.  With scotch tape it worked fine on a slide in slot even with the slight extra thickness of the scotch tape.  I've laid it next to regular sims and can't tell which is which by feel.The stickers I received do not have the dotted outline, which I thought was a template to cut a sim. But if you cut them along with the sim, you couldn't use them as the backing. Since you can use the actual hole in the plastic holder as a template, I'm not sure why a separate one is needed.  Just trace right on the sim through the hole and no reason to mess with a template.",5
i like using different cell phones and having a micro sim takes the fun away when u have to use a mobile which doesnt support microsim and thats when i saw this on amazon and wanted it ASAP. i ordered it and it was delivered well in time. and once i liked it i ordered 10 more just in case ( they are just a dollar and so useful ) but i only recceived 1 instead. i wrote to the seller and he reacted soon and apologized for the misunderstanding and sent the rest soon.I rate them 5 stars and would most definitely buy from the seller again.,5
"unlike some other adapters, these have an open 'base' so the SIM fits much better in these. It is relatively easy to move in and out of the SIM holder as well. works great.",5
"Worked, and saved me from having to go to AT&T; for a new SIM.The adapter, because it can't keep the SIM secured in place (due to width restrictions), relies on the phone's SIM slot to do so.  On my Tilt, that wasn't a problem as the SIM slot is a trap-door style.  For other types of phones, though, there may be concern that the SIM will slip out of the adapter and become stuck (think iPhone/iPhone 3G).",5
"Fit my micro SIM just fine, and the included stickers help to keep it in place. I would recommend this.",5
"Item arrived in just a few days just as described, holds my sim card just right so I can use other phones! Thank You!",5
"There isn't much to say about this microSIM adapter as it's just a piece of plastic, but I have been using it for a couple of months without any problems.  The sticker that came with it made trimming my normal sized SIM very easy.  In case it matters, I purchased from SF Planet.",5
"fits well, love the stickers for cutting and the whole thing is less than a cup of coffee. WORD COUNT!!!",5
"This is the greatest deal that i had never made on amazon!  come on guys, it's free shipping and it's not even 2 dollar? where u gonna find a great deal like this!  If u need this, just buy it, you won't regret!",5
really like this adapter becaue it is super thin as opposed as some of the other plastic ones that I have purchased,5
"I used this and it worked great. No complaints, no breaking, not anything, it just worked. I read some people that had bad experiences with these but for me it worked as promised.",5
Got this for my iphone 3gs. I have a micro sim card already for my iphone 4s but when i try to put the sim in my 3gs the card falls out cause the housing is backwards in my mind. the iphone 3gs has a sim tray that that this adapter sits in but the sime card fits into the adapter upside down so if u dont hold it all together the micro card will just fall on the floor. works but flawed.,3
"It would be great if they can put a little more instruction on this page.1- put the micro-sim into the tray.2- stick the sticker in the back of the tray so it doesn't fall out. (I think you may use regular tape if you swap from the iPad and iPhone often)3- put it into the iPhone sim card tray and insert it to the phone, DONE.Instead of spending 20 bucks to get a new regular sim card, this is a 1 dollar and 1 cent solution.",5
"I use this to switch between an iPhone 4s and a Galaxy S2 LTE Skyrocket. It works good. I called at&t and switched the data plan to 4g LTE (make sure they keep your unlimited data plan if you have one) and there is no issues using the 4g LTE plan on my iPhone. I got a bad sim and when I went to at&t to get a new one (both phones were telling my no sim) the guy behind the counter said 'I can get the iPhone to make calls but I don't think you can surf the web.' I said yeah, it works, I have been doing it. Please just get me a new micro sim. :) He did and all is well again. Thats it!!",5
"I got this item (edit: got it from SF Planet) because reviews indicate that the adapter actually fits into most phones, unlike the adapters that come with SIM card cutters. I don't have a SIM card cutter, so getting the cutout stickers was for fun. I discovered that razor blades cut SIM cards like butter, and the adapter works great - just remember to tape it into the adapter on one side if you don't have a sticker, or your card may get stuck in a phone.",5
"I bought this to use an existing Micro-SIM in an old phone that I wanted to update. It works just as it should. Specifically, I have a Nokia Lumia 920 and I needed to put the SIM in an old iPhone 3GS to set it up. It worked just fine.It has two templates for cutting a full-size SIM down to Micro-SIM. Didn't use them and don't plan to. 5 stars for the adapter itself.",5
"Got this on time. THis little item does the magic of SIM conversion from micro to a regular SIM, very well.Micro sim AT&T; perfectly fits in the adapter .",5
"It works well.  I use it on my iPhone 4's SIM to use on another GSM phone with a regular-sized SIM and it works well.Use the one with the scissor symbol (but don't cut it) because its the only one that came off with adhesive intact.  The one labeled with big 'MicroSIM Adapter' came off without adhesive and so useless.  I don't know, its probably how I handled it.The black plastic frame is easily bendable but is understandable because it has to be, in order to fit into a SIM card slot.",5
"I love how cheap this is.  This is what I'm talking about!  It did take forever to come, which was warned in the huge estimated delivery date before I placed the order. It was mailed directly from Hong Kong by someplace that clearly was a knock-off of the Walmart name which I thought was funny. If you need this sooner than a month, like I ended up being, order the $5 one from Amazon.  I know, quite the price gap, but when you need a working phone, you just can't wait a month.Product works great of course, plastic frame, not much to review about it. It works with any time you  need a micro SIM to fit into any regular SIM card slot; any phone at all.",5
It takes some work to make this thing work correctly.  Its not very useful.  Many of the phones that take a regular SIM today can also take a microSIM by simply placing it correctly.  My microSIM keeps falling out of this thing when trying to use it in the phone.,3
"I picked up one of these from the seller smartphonechargers, but instead of getting an adapter with a complete micro-sim punchout, what I got was one with a recessed tray.Technically speaking, I guess it's a bit nicer. However, in a phone where the sim slides in face-down, it's a nightmare to use. And what's more, the card itself is just thick enough that it may not fit in some phones at all. (It definitely doesn't fit in a Samsung Galaxy Nexus without bending the slot retainer.)Fortunately, it was cheap enough that it's not worth the return postage to get a new one.",2
The only problem I have with this product and it is a minor problem is that the adapter uses a sticker.  If you are using this product to switch in between different phones this may pose an issue where the sticker will get beat up.  Trying to find something of an equivalent value is hard to find.  Overall this product does what it says its suppose to and it is cheap.,5
Was able to easily fit my T-Mobile sim and use to swap phones.. Works great and as described- Very nice priced as well!,5
in this sim adapter micro sim cards fits perfectly. have no problem with phone after insert this adapter with sim,3
not a 100% fit but it does the job. and also if u use it back and forth the adhesive will run out and you just have to improvise with a scotch tape.,4
"Before I bought this, I read a number of reviews that indicated that they did not fit correctly or damaged the pins in the phone.  I bought two from SFPlanet with the intent of testing them carefully and returning them if they didn't fit.I got them today and was pleasantly surprised.  The ones that I received are exactly as depicted in the photo.  They have smooth edges, and are the correct size to fit into the SIM slot on all three phones that I tested.  One of the phones had a traditional metal SIM slot that you open by sliding the mechanism to the side and lifting up.  Another phone had a slide mechanism with a metal holder.  Another had a slide mechanism that was plastic.  The adaptor fit into each of these phones easily and without any risk of damage.The kit includes two stickers, whose function is to use as a guide to cut-down a full-size SIM.  The stickers are not intended to hold the MicroSIM into the adapter, and would probably make it too large.Admittedly, I have NOT actually put a MicroSIM into the adapter to test it, but that's the next step.  If it doesn't work, I'll update this review accordingly.",5
worked good did exactlly what I wanted it to do so I am satisfied with the product. I would recommend this product for someone with a iphone 4 and going to a phone that has a regular size sim. it helps really.,5
"I received the product, it works as advertised.  Nothing much more to add than that.  I would buy again.  Thanks.",4
I had to get one for just case I needed to take my micro back into my old phone. Takes a micro and turns it into the big one again.,5
"This works exactly as advertised.  You put the micro SIM in the adapter, attach the sticker to the back to keep it locked in to the adapter, and then insert it in to your device.  My only complaint is that since this uses a sticker, the sticker can sometimes make it difficult to push back in to the device.  I haven't had it come off, but there is a spare included in case this happens it seems, but it would be nice just to have it lock in there some other way.  Other than that there's absolutely nothing wrong with this.",4
"I ordered from Importer 520 since they are located in California, I didn't want to wait up to 20 days for something to arrive from Hong Kong to save a few cents. I bought 3 in case I need to use this again and they are not reusable. The card adapters I received did not have little tabs or lips to hold the mini sim card, but that doesn't seem to be a problem. I only used one sticker on the back (or top) of the sim and adapter. Everything worked the first time I placed it in the phone and I haven't had any trouble after 2 weeks. I came from an iPhone 4 to a Galaxy Nexus (GSM) on AT&T",3
"I recently received a galaxy s3 that uses a microsim.  Unfortunately, the battery on the S3 doesn't last long.  It's either carry a charger or something along with the phone or use it only as a phone and use my samsung galaxy tab p6800 for all other purposes.  The P6800 uses a regular sim so swapping this sim isn't possible without this adapter.  Instead of cutting the regular sim, I use the microsim provided by the new phone.  To use it in the p6800 as a phone/data, I can insert the microsim into the adaptor and tape one side of the adapter to hold the sim in place.  Voila!  I can use the same sim on both devices.Warning!  Someone mentioned before, don't inside the adapter w/o the microsim because it will be trapped in there.Solution:  I solved this problem by taping both sides of the sim tray and left the tray inside my p6800.",5
"Sent in my iPhone 4 to get some cash before the iPhone 4S would be released.Got this so that I could use the microSIM card in my Samsung Focus until the 4S is sent out.The adapter is too thick (sadly, only about 1mm) to be used in the Focus. Ended up having to just get it pushed in the slot just right.",2
"This adapter works perfectly, fits well, does it's job and is a very good value for the price.  No need to pay for anything more!",5
This took forever to arrive but it eventually came and works surprisingly well. It didn't get stuck in my phone like another adapter did. Does the job and the price is right. I'd buy it again.,4
"Ok, I checked around and there are a couple of different types of these adapters.  Some are just stamped from a sheet of plastic, and other ones have retainers in the corners of the cutout (more expensive to manufacture), and the best ones have a closed back.  The picture shows the corner retainers but the ones I recieved were just stamped out (no retainers).  When I put a microsim into the adapter and slid it into my Samsung Galaxy S3, the contact fingers locked into the cutout of the adapter and prevented it from being withdrawn.  If I had forced the adapter and simcard out of the phone, the contacts would have been ruined.  I ended up using a very thin and stiff but tough piece of plastic sheet to wedge the contacts out of the adapter so I could remove the adapter.Overall, due to potential phone damage, I really can't justify even a 1 star rating.***This adapter is dangerous to the health of your phone***Highly not recommended.",1
"This adapter perfectly fitted my microsim, and allowed me to use it in my Galaxy Note - which requires a full size sim. It worked exactly as described. And you can't beat the price. Would definitely recommend.",5
"Great for international travelers. I never knew how important sim size is. Most modern smarphones use the standard micro-sim, but older, bulkier phones (I'm looking at you Blackberry!) are still in the last century. This little tool and holder is just what I needed. Plus, it's dirt cheap.",5
"Hard to get my sim to stay in there even with the sticky material. I can see how it could work if your sim falls into place easily, but some phones like BlackBerry have a very thin slide in that causes the micro sim to dislodge from the carrier.Luckily, you can put a micro sim in a standard sim blackberry because of the way the sim slides under the bracket, so it was really not needed after all.",3
Nothing too fancy about this screen protector set. The price is right and it's the basic material which will provide basic scratch protection. The only downfall is you may go through these pretty quickly with normal wear and tear use.,4
Great case. It lasted for a long time and was very durable for the price I paid for it. Ill definitely recommend this product to a friend.,5
"I love this caseit is a great product and I would tell everyone to get one, silicone case are great and cute",5
"There isn't many accessories out for the HTC Aria.  It's probably due to the fact it's never been really marketed and it doesn't have the processing power of the majority of the popular Android phones.  I have had my Aria for the better part of a year and I primarily wanted a case that offered protection, but more importantly I wanted a case so I could find my phone easily. With so many gadgets and stuff... it's easy to lose this phone in the sea of stuff around my house and office.  For $5, I decided to check this out.  The yellow stands out... and matches the inside of the Aria.  It's a fairly simple silicone case.  Not fancy... but it works.  The best part is the price.",4
"Fit perfect, last long, work well. A must have for any touch screen. Would definately buy again. GREAT VALUE. Be careful when putting on your phone, one tiny piece of dust and you will go crazy trying to get air bubble out.",5
This phone cover came really fast. New and in pkg. Great color and protects my phone as should. Love the silicone covers!!,5
I really just got this for the color but I wish it was better cause having this case 6 months with it my screen broke but its alright though cause I know this wasn't meant to protect the screen but still I wish it was a hard cover and not rubbery lol,3
NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM EITH IT. EASY TO PUT ON AND HELPS KEEP SCREEN CLEAN AND HELPS TO NOT GET SCRATCHED UP!!!,5
It works but the phone looks super ugly in the cover. I took it off. The frame is very thick - what is good for protection. Probably all the shell cases for Aria make this phone look bad so I'm not planning to buy another one.,4
"I got these for my teens phone and they went on very well - I was impressed. I normally don't like screen protectors and end up with dirt specks and bubbles.This was easy and there was only one bubble at the bottom where my daughter didn't care anyway. Overall very pleased with price, prompt shipping, and value for my money!",5
Works wonders and does exactly what it's supposed to do. The screen has outlasted the phone itself. Would recommend this product.,5
These are great easy to use. covers the full screen of the phone not just the square.  there great very happy,5
"I liked this product. I was able to clean any dirt with the cloth and was able to stick it on the phone without any major air bubbles. The reason for 4 stars is because I think it is too thin. The point is to protect the screen from any scratches but I don't know if it can be capable of doint that. But that's just a concern and not a problem with the screen protector. So In summary, a pretty good product for the price",4
"Great buy, you can't beat it. When I need more I will certianly get them here, try them you'll like the results.",5
Purchased this in conjunction with the extended battery.  Case is a perfect fit and is very snug.  I also recommend purchasing the extended battery Seidio rugged case with holster as it is a well made and sturdy case.,5
"This Seidio 'Extended Case' is made specifically for the HTC EVO with theSeidio Innocell 3500 mAh Extended Life Battery for HTC EVO 4G (Black)installed. My old case no longer fit since the extended battery is so much bigger than the stock battery it comes with a new, larger back-plate.This case is easy to install since it is one piece that just snaps into place around the EVO. The case does not cover the camera or stand on the back and allows access to all of the side buttons and ports, but does not cover the top or bottom edge of the phone (where the power button, charger port, and HDMI port are located). It does provide a lip around the sides of the screen that raises it up to help prevent scratches when setting the EVO face down on a flat surface.This is a good cover that gives me a little peace of mind.UPDATE - Aug 25, 2012: After using this for almost two years, this case has provided great protection from innumerable drops. It has finally developed a crack from a drop off a high ladder, but it saved the phone from taking any damage! I am so pleased that I am ordering a replacement.Recommended!CFH",4
i bought this online because you cant find it in stores its perfect love it good protection  not to bulky good A+,5
"Does not cover the top and bottom of the phone. That being said, this cover still protects, looks good, and fits perfectly into the innotraveler car dock. Seidio sells alot of cool cases that fit over the innocell extended life battery, but if you are wanting the best car dock for the EVO, then this case is a must buy. Life long Seidio customer.",5
"This is more appropriately called a 'sleeve', rather than a case. It covers the back and sides of your Evo 4G with the Seidio 3500mAh extended battery installed. There is absolutely no protection for the top or bottom. So when you accidentally drop your Evo make sure to tell it not to land on its top or bottom!Like all Seidio products, it is grossly overpriced, so be sure to shop wide and wisely for the best possible price. At least you don't have to worry about choosing between a variety of cases as this is the only one made for the Evo and 3500 mAh extended battery.The sleeve (case, if you prefer) is made from plastic which appears to be about 1/16th of an inch thick. You install it by slipping the Evo into the side with the volume controls under the lip of the case and then popping the other side in. Takes a few seconds. Doesn't add much to the overall thickness of the unit or the weight.The openings for the camera and LEDs and kickstand are placed well and do not interfere with normal operations. Those using a wide-angle lens attachment will not be pleased. The extended battery case already blocks the rim around the lens needed to mount the accessory and this makes the problem a bit more severe. But relatively few people will be affected by this. The volume controls are a little more difficult to use with the sleeve on, but not enough to aggravate.The material feels sort of textured, which is nice since the Seidio extended battery back is flimsy and doesn't have a very grippable surface.Taking it off isn't difficult, so you won't lose a lot of time when you have to access the battery or microSD card.Overall, try not to pay the price on Seidio's site. Shop around and buy it at the lowest price you can find. This sleeve doesn't give full protection to your Evo, but considering it is the only show in town, something is certainly better than nothing. Just remember:  as your Evo hurtles toward the concrete, scream 'Don't land on your top or bottom!' and you'll do just fine.Jerry",3
This case with my new Seidio battery are a perfect match. My stock Evo battery barely last 4 hours if I was using the mobile WiFi or the GPS Navigation. With the Seidio battery I get over 8 hours of use with my Evo and can use all the functions without any worries.The case is perfect for the new look of the back of the phone. It protects your phone in case you accidentally drop it and it keeps the battery from flying out if you drop your phone.  I hate using a phone without a case but that problem was solved fast with this product. It also keeps smudges and scratches off the back and sides of your phone which is great.Bottomline...the Evo 4G is the best cell phone I have ever used. The Seidio 3500 is the best battery I have ever had in a cell phone. The case is just the icing on the cake. I actually own an iPhone 4G and after buying this new battery...I only use that phone for games and music.,5
"People complain it doesn't protect the bottom and top while it's true, you can clearly see the photos that it doesn't protect the bottom and top! If that doesn't sit well with you, don't buy it :-) To me, it doesn't matter.People complain, it leaves the camera and flash wide open and dust and other particles goes in. This is true if you remove the original back that came with the extended battery. However, proper installation of this case requires the extended back to be installed, then this case snap over that cover then it's perfect![...]The case is pretty solidly built. It has a matte finish with s semi rubber feel to it. Not rubbery like other cases. It fits well in your hands and feels secure.",4
"I like this case a lot.  I needed an extended case, and this one turned out to be an excellent choice.  I had an I-phone before, and I used a larger battery in it as well.  I tried cases from different people for the I-phone with mixed results.  But this case for the HTC was really a good choice.  It lasted as long as the phone - unfortunately battery life in the HTC was so bad even with the larger battery that I gave up and went to a Galaxy SIII phone, but when I gave up on the phone the Seidio case was still going strong.",5
"As has been pointed out in another review, the top and bottom of the phone are not protected by this case.  That said, it's better than no protection at all.  If seidio had followed its own example and used the top and bottom half approach they used in their case for the Evo with the standard battery, they would have had a great product.  I'll use this until a better one comes along.",3
"This does its job fairly well.Doesn't cover the top or bottom, accidentally got my phone knocked out of my hand by my dog, fell to the floor and nothing happened to it, so I'm happy.",4
This bluetooth works great!  Clear sound and communication is clear as well.  It's fairly comfortable and fits stays put too.,5
"This the most comfortable Bluetooth headset I have ever used. There is no need to use the hook with this one. The gel inserts provide alot comfort and stay in your ear well. Battery life is very good at 6 plus hours. I sound quality to be pretty good. Most of the time I experienced hissing and crackling sounds during the call. This headset was very easy to use and connect to my htc sensation. iPad 2 and hp laptop.  I really liked the dedicated talk, power and volume buttons. The volume button is not a rocker it's just one button which cycles through 5 different volumes. This headset doesn't support a2dp. So you cannot stream music or use VoIP apps with it. I was able to use Skype on both my iPad 2 and my hp laptop.  Overall this is a great headset for the price of $30. I ended up returning this one because of the hissing and crackling sounds. For the same price I was able to get the Samsung hm6450. Which provides much better call quality and features and no hissing and crackling sounds. The Samsung hm6450 also has a2dp support and comes with a stereo headset for music.",3
Star for style.Star for secure fit.I have my phone in my left pocket and the headset in my right ear. Just moving my head perhaps 1/4&#34; inch would cause it to cut in and out. And there are many of the quarter inches...,2
"Great for making calls but doesnt support podcasts, itunes, just calls.  So i retuned it for the M50.  Which works very well",3
"Pros:Small6 hour battery lifecomfortal in the ear.  I'm using the inside ear clip and not the over ear clipCons:Too sensitive to background noise, even in quite rooms.  I get complaints from the other end of the phone if the room isn't absolutely quite.",4
This Plantronics M100 is great. The comfort of the ear piece is so nice and it has the ear wrap around that I found light and comfortable. There are also 3 sizes of ear buds that can be used instead of the wrap. There is good quality sound and very clear reception. Outside you hear the person's voice with little background sound and no wind problems. It has a dual microphone that adds to the superior sound as well as a battery meter for use with my iPhone. It has about a 35 foot range and was very easy to set it up. The only problem is the packaging is really hard to get into.,4
"I'm back again buying another bluetooth after my cat ate yet another (13 and counting). I bounce back and forth with Plantronics models but this one affords me a shape my cat is not very attracted to, though she fancies the ear loop quite a bit. One thing that is an absolute pet (ha!) peeve of mine is short talk time on bluetooths. This one has an excellent available talk time and as someone who is on the phone all dang day, that's important. I notice I can not listen to music through my bluetooth, but I have never liked to listen to music through my bluetooth, so that doesn't bother me a bit. No complaints from anyone I talk to on it, and again, I'm on it all day so there are many listeners. :)",5
"I bought this to replace a Jawbone Icon HD that's microphone stopped working. It works, it's quiet compared to the Icon which was quiet when paired with my crappy Samsung Gusto II work phone. It's looking like it's going to be a pain while in my noisy van and driving.Pairing was annoying, as others have said the instructions are wrong. It say to 'Press and hold the power button' lol the power switch is not a button, and the button needed to be pressed was not obvious. I did manage to accidentally find said button and also pair to my phone.Update: It's not as quiet now, I turned the volume up(duh!). However there is either no noise cancelling or it just isn't effective. I gave it an extra star, since it's not quiet anymore.",4
"This Bluetooth headset is a worker bee.  It will tell you how many hours are left when you turn the unit on. It also will tell you when you have turned it off. The battery life is really good and is up to 6 hours.  It's light weight, fits well with the ear hooks that are also light weight. It isn't bulky looking. I wear it in public and isn't that noticeable.  I've had this for about a year and it keeps working as promised.  Plantronics products have been pretty reliable in my experience.  If you rely on Bluetooth for your cell phone, this is highly recommended.",5
"I thought for a while how best to describe the quality and functionality of the Plantronics M100. In the end, I decided to compare and contrast my last ear piece with the M100. Better yet, what I hated about my old ear piece and love about the M100.Comfort-Old Ear Piece: Uncomfortable, no matter how I adjusted it or how many ear tips I tried it just hurt to wear. Hard plastic ear loop and not well designed silicone ear piece cover.-M100: absolutely the most comfortable ear piece I have ever had. I can't begin to describe how comfortable is sits in your ear and stays in place. Very comfortable flexible ear loop what is easy on and easy off. The internal ear piece cover has is comfortable and has a unique extruding piece that hold the unit in place that does not hurt your ear.On/Off-Old ear piece: Has a small hard to reach push button that provides no real way of showing that the unit is turned on.-M100: It has an honest to goodness slide button. If you see red it's off, if you don't see red it's on. But wait there more, when you turn it on the unit will tell you that it's on and how much talk time you have. When you turn it off the unit will tell you it's turning off!Connectivity-Old ear piece: You could not tell if the device was connected to the phone, the blue tooth light would flash but you might have to power it on and off to make sure the unit is connected. As you can imagine that it was very frustrating when a call would come in and the unit would not pick up the phone transmission.-M100: The unit will tell you it's connected and no matter how long you have not used the unit it will preserve the connection with reduced power usage. I've had zero issues.Range-Old ear piece: Roughly about 33 feet. The only issue is that when you exceeded the range you just loose the call with little notice.-M100: The range is 33 feet however, if you exceed the ranged the unit will tell you that you are 'loosing connectivity' and when you walk back it will tell you that you are 'regaining connectivity.'Setup-Old ear piece:  some issues setting the unit up the first time with one reset required.-M100: Very simple to setup. The instruction guide was helpful however; I really don't think you needed it to setup the unit.Sound/Noise Cancelling-Old ear piece: The sound reception is always spotty. Most calls the person on the other end would complain about not being able to hear me and for static. Outdoors - you might as well not have a call. Any wind what so ever and you could not hear and the person on the other end would not be able to hear.-M100: Nothing but complements with the sound quality from the various people I have talked with including being able to hear me typing. Outdoors - no issues in moderate to heavy winds.Features Unique to Plantronics M100-Dual microphone in the unit helps with sound quality and clarity.-Headset battery meter for iPhone.-Multiple device connectivity - this might not be important to some purchases however, if you are in the same boat as my wife she needs two phones because her company does not allow personal calls on a company cell phone. This makes that situation much nicer. I have not tried connecting the headset with an iPad or other type device yet but it's coming.-Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR and eSCO",5
"This unit has pretty fair battery life, clear incoming audio and is very comfortable.  One area most of these types of gizmos fail (this is no exception) is when both parties are using one on the same call. Not sure exactly why this creates an issue, but those calls are very frustrating.It wouldn't stop me from buying this headset, as I think it is far better than most.",4
I returned it.  I own the Savor M1100 and I lost so I thought I would try something else and the audio quality was bad.  I would numerous complaints of echos or poor quality.,2
"I primarily use this with my LG Prime phone, and the connection is seamless.I have set up this headset to automatically connect as soon as it's turned on and even in mid call the phone will switch to this headset a second after I turn it on. Overall the M100 is much, MUCH better than Plantronics Voyager 520 that I used before this.After you switch the headset power button to 'On', there is a voice notification that tells you the battery status (in number of minutes of talk time remaining). The moment it connects to the phone you will hear 'Connected', which confirms the connection.Voice quality is perfect. The people on the other have no problems hearing me and I have no problem hearing them. On my end voice quality is exactly the same as holding the phone to my ear, and there is no noise.Comfort-wise this thing is again amazing. It's so light, you pretty much forget you have it on. The rubber cushions come in three sizes, which is again very welcome.It comes with an AC power adapter, but because the headset uses a Micro USB connector, you can use ANY standard micro USB cord to charge the headset from USB ports on your PC (in addition to the AC power adapter). Even now I'm using my laptop to charge this, using the standard micro USB cable I have with me most of the time. This is much better than other Bluetooth headsets I've used, as this one doesn't force you into proprietary chargers and cables.Again, this is the best bluetooth headset I've ever owned. I have literally zero complaints about it, and absolutely love it.",5
"This is probably the 3 or 4th bluetooth headset i have every owned including other plantronics headsets. This by far the best i have owned and this is why;1. it has a bonafide switch (not a push button), this is huge when you want to be sure it is off when you get a call and don't want to use it.2. CALL QUALITY: is excellent both ways, i can hear very well and no one has complained or noticed i was using a headset3. SIZE: it is small enough to fit in my pocket when i don't want to wear it4. HEADSET INFO: it has audio based info (ie. when it is turned on or off, how much battery is left5. COMFORT: very comfortable to wear for long periods, it comes with adjustable silicone ear piecesOther: range seems decent but not stellar from my experience, setup was easy as it has been with others and as it should be, battery will last me at least a week but i only have it one for an hour or so a dayTIP: if you have and Android based phone you can get an app called 'Bluetooth Audio Widget' that will stream any audio to your bluetooth, ie. music audio, movie audio.",5
"This is my first Bluetooth headset, I wanted something small and lightweight with good features. After lots of research, this one came out on top. Pairs quickly with my Samsung Exhibit II 4G, LONG range, I can set the phone down and go at least 30 ft. I love the voice prompts, tells you battery time, volume level, connect/disconnected. Sound quality is better than holding the phone, callers hear me clearly, even with a window down in the car. I can go for weeks w/o charging (depends on use), charges fast. I like the medium-sized earpiece, easily removed for cleaning. The one accessory you should have for any cellphone, highly recommended!",5
"I purchased this for use with my wife's iPhone 5s and she loves it.  The ear buds are perfect with 3 sizes to choose from and even with her small ears, it does not hurt her ears after using for extended periods of time.  The sound quality is great and there doesn't seem to even be any lag in the communication between the device and the phone.  The buttons are in great location with ease of use to make calls and answer calls as well as the volume buttons being in an easy access location.  Highly recommend for use.",5
"This bluetooth works great.  Sound is good, set-up was easy & it's easy to use.  The only complaint I have is that even the smallest of the 3 earbud covers is a little big for me and gets uncomfortable after a while.  I haven't researched to see if there is anything smaller to put on it.  In spite of that, it stays really well even without using the over the ear piece.",4
"I have literally had to put my had to my ear to make sure this thing was in my ear.  Super comfortable.  Recharges very quickly.  I have had this for a little over a month.  It linked up with my Iphone 4s very quickly and sounds very good.  Works with Siri as well.  I just wish you could play music via bluetooth.  But I don't think any of them do that.  I am very satisfied with this.  It will be interesting how long it lasts, but for the price, you can keep buying.  Comfort is the big issue for me and this headset is amazing in that department!",5
"I bought this item for my new iphone 5 but refuses to work. I will still continue to try to program it, but surprisingly, it works perfectly for my iphone 3GS. It earns a five-star because it was not advertized specifically for iphone 5.",5
"This is a great bluetooth headset. I had been holding out on getting a bluetooth for a while but finally broke down and got one - it's a game changer. I commute 40 miles, one way, each day so this was a lifesaver (literally).I don't spend a lot of time on the phone but I do drive a stick shift, so having the extra hand is extremely handy (especially when you're trying to eat cereal and shift at the same time, (I don't recommend this)).The battery life is decent (6 hours) and it alerts you of the status every time you turn it on. If you do a lot of talking, you might want to find one with a longer battery though.There is no A2DP support (streaming audio) which is a bummer. Though to be honest if I'm listening to anything with my phone I'd opt for headphones due to the short battery.Another bonus, if you're using an iPhone, there's a battery indicator that shows up in the top of the screen to show you how your battery is doing.Things I liked:-easy to connect-good audio quality-micro USB charger-multiple ear bud types (and optional earloop)Things I didn't like:-No A2DP-Less than stellar battery lifeOverall I'd recommend getting one, especially since they're quite inexpensive now.It's a very handy headset.",4
"I love this bluetooth, when you're turning it on it says &#34;Power on, talk time 5 hours, connected&#34; or however many hours your have left on your charge. It's really clear, gets loud enough, and again I love how it tells you how much talking time is left.",5
"After only two months, I 'traded in' my BlueAnt Q2 for this device.  No need to initiate phone commands on the IPhone 4s prior to dialing (as is the case with the Q2), fits right against your face (the Q2 sticks out a lot), and the on-off switch is in a visible and accessible location (the Q2's is a royal pain to see and use).  Shop around, however, because there are better Internet prices out there.",5
"I'm the type of person who usually doesn't write reviews but I had to for this.This is an awesome bluetooth for the price.  The gel tips and loop makes it very comfortable and fits nice and snug.  Sometimes I forget I have it in my ear!The sound quality is very good; I can hear the caller loud and clear and vice versa, even if I am outside.Very easy to set up.  I have a Samsung Vibrant and my phone detected the bluetooth right away and paired with no issues at all.Overall, a great buy for the price.",5
"The clarity of this headset and noise canceling ability are among the best out there, and it has a nice minimal profile.  People can't tell I'm on a headset which is what I was looking for.  The noise canceling capabilities work about as good as you can hope for.  This headset is usable in a noisy server room, just don't forget to speak up as it's easy to forget that you still have to talk over the noise even with the canceling help.  Comfort is great if you aren't afraid to take a razor blade to the loop on the in-ear rubber piece (I used the scissors on a small swiss army knife, and some sand paper to smooth it out).  The idea is that it will keep the headset in your ear without the ear hook attached.  It seems like it might work, but the pressure that loop puts on the inside of your ear is extremely uncomfortable, and I think there's a good chance it could fall off at the least opportune moment.  When you cut that loop off and attach the included ear-hook, you end up with a conventional and comfortable headset that you can hardly tell is on.  The only other complaint I have is that the call button on the side is so recessed that it can be difficult to press.  I ended up sticking a small pad on it to make it easier to press.  You really shouldn't have to do this stuff to end up with a good headset, so I am subtracting a star for what could have been a 5/5 out of the box.",4
Not sure what the problem was with this but it did not sync with my IPHONE 4 so I gave it to someone who had a cell that was not a smartphone and it synced with theirs. Plantronics is a good name so I was of course disappointed. My intention is not to give it bad review but to let you know of my experience with it.,2
"I have to say that I almost took a star off my review for the terrible packaging this headset came in. Not only was it ridiculously difficult to remove, I was worried I might break the unit getting it out of the packaging. Egads! Also, what ships in this large package is just the headset unit, the power cable and a pamphlet of docs. All of this would have fit in a box / package 5 times smaller than what it shipped in. Clearly the packaging was meant to stand up vertically and be displayed at ATT or some other retail cell location. All this being said I am not rating this headset based on the docs. (But I wanted to!).First let me say I am not a bluetooth headset expert, I briefly owned the apple bluetooth headset for the iphone but returned it. I also tried the altec lansing stereo bluetooth headphone / headset to less than stellar results. Since those experiments, I just used the very nice apple headphone with the built in mic and volume controls (the ones you buy separate for the iphone for about $40).  I just found those to be very easy and I can listen to music while I work or drive and then also make or take calls easily. Also you don't need to charge them up.Pros of the M1000R BT Headset:Small, lightweight design, you barely feel it in your ear.It uses both a wrap around ear holder or also a new soft rubber 'plug'. I don't know how to describe it but it works very well. You choose which works better. I liked the plug a lot.Comes with 3 sizes of the rubber 'plug' (ok i need to find out the right word) and it's very comfortable and stays in place. This was well researched and designed.Call quality is strong, loud, i tested it 10-20 feet away with no problems. I could get used to this.There is a built in voice that tells you the status, volume level, battery life.... snazzy.It seems to work flawlessly with the iphone 4 (paired perfectly), all functions worked. You hold the headset button down to activate the iphone's voice dial feature.Battery life seems strong, says 6 hours, haven't talked enough to know for sure. Charges very fast.You power it off with a slider rocker, I like that, sometimes you never know if it's on or off with the soft click buttons.Cons: (not many)Packaging sucked, yeah I know, move on.Only comes with a home charger, its nice and small, but would some sort of combo auto charger be a lot to ask?Pressing the call button sort of squishes your ear, it's a hard press. Maybe it will soften up over time.There are are 3 buttons on the unit - power, call functions, and volume. This is fine but the docs come with a big list of functions that you either single tap or double tap to enable. Many of these are based on the status of your call. If its an active call the taps do different things, it's the call was lost they try to redial or reconnect. It just seems a little complicated considering you are likely to be driving in the car, etc. I dunno, maybe this is the best way to go. The basic functions work fine using the tap to take a call and the volume to adjust.The voice dial function takes a little getting used to, You hold down the call button for 2 secs, then it bongs at you, but that signal is just telling the iphone to start its voice dial function. So then you wait to hear the iphone's sort of double bong that means you can now give your voice command. It takes some getting used to, I wasn't sure how long to hold the button down for and when to speak. it seems I was always talking too soon or too late.All in all, a great headset for the $$.",4
"I bought this for my son, so he could be handsfree while on the phone, playing games on the computer with his friends. Oh boy, does he love it. He can now play, without having the phone on speaker, or holding it with his shoulders to his ear. The quality is also great and the price was nice. Easy to install. We did have some difficulty uninstalling it from one phone, since he upgraded his phone, but we got it done. The plantronics web-site walked us through the process.",5
"Received this 3.1.13.  It is now 6.29.13 and it stopped working correctly 2+ weeks ago.  Voice dialing won't work.  It's supposed to beep 3 times to active voice calling.  Now I get 2 beeps, a wait, and the 'Pairing'.  It then deactivates itself.  Expected FAR better from Plantronics.  I'm contacting Amazon to see if it's still under warranty.",1
"Right to it...=====================The Pros=====================+[Feather Light]:I have actually had to touch the headset to make sure I still had it on. Very light indeed+[Comfortable]:With the feather light weight and fit, this headset can be worn throughout a whole day without issue.+[Spoken Alerts]:'Connected', 'Lost Connection', 'Talk Time, 5hrs', etc... A welcome option for knowing what's going on with your headset, instead of having to decipher what different blinking LEDs mean+[Easy Pairing]:Pairing with my Nexus One phone was fast, easy and rock stable. As soon as I go out of range, the headset says so. When I get back in range, it automatically re-pairs and also says so.+[Excellent Range]: While at home, I like to keep my phone plugged in to charge and just walk around the house with these headsets on, while the phone stays in one location. As long as I'm within the rated range, there's no problem with maintaining the connection. No need to keep the headset and phone within super close range.+[Wear on Left or Right Ear]:With the dual-mounting way these headsets are worn on the ear, it makes wearing them on your left or right ear a non-issue.+[Good Inbound/Outbound Voice]:With good signal on the phone, the incoming voice quality is on par with using the phone's earpiece directly. Similarly, the outgoing voice when I've called others has been reported to being the same as using the phone's mic.=====================The Cons=====================-[Needs More Isolation]: The feather light weight and non-invasive earpiece make for excellent comfort, but at the expense of letting in more ambient noise (even with the built-in DSP noise filter). I find myself having to use a finger to press the earpiece closer to my ear to hear better.=====================Conclusion=====================Easy to use, solid performer. Well recommended.",4
"I would not recommend this bluetooth!  The sound quality is poor, and very uncomfortable to wear.  Pay the extra money and buy a better one!",1
"I really like this one. It is small & light, sound is good, and it does not make a lump in your pocket. It is pretty comfortable but annoying for long periods (I am fussy) since in goes in and out so easily you can just hang it in your ear when you get a call. Sophisticated interface - talks to you about volume and connection status and puts a battery bar on top of the iPhone screen. Reconnects when you come into range without a fuss. I haven't lost it yet but it is small enough to disappear easily. I did immediately lose the ear loop so I can't comment on that.",4
"I swore to myself I would never be one of those people who would wear a blue tooth ear piece, but when I saw this on the list, I had to try it.  Before I was using my Garmin for my blue tooth needs, but I won't go back.This is really easy to use.  Click a button dial a number.  Click a button, hang up.  Click a button twice, redial.  That easy.  And it's loud and clear, unlike the Garmin.It comes with three ear bud sizes, I went with the smallest one, and though they always hurt my ears after awhile, I can last a pretty long time with this one in my ear.Also, the battery lasts a long time, and every time you turn it on, it tells you how much talk time you have left.No complaints from me.  Love it.Edited to say:  After using this for a few weeks, the on button fell off and it was so small I could not find it.  Other than that, I loved this thing.",5
"7/26/2011I love the fit of this headset.  I wear it without the hook and that has been enough. I love the power bar and notification features.  However, here are the issues that keep this particular Plantronics from being the best I've owned:1)Sometimes the sound clarity and noise reductions are excellent.  Sometimes, the noise reduction is awful. There have been many times I've actually had to stop using the headset and resort to the phone because the sound was so terrible. Even when reducing the volume, the feedback was dreadful.2)I've owned this for about 2 months. Last week, I started having 'out of range' issues.  Now this is QUITE irritating. I can understand a dropped connection 25 feet away - even though it boast connection up to 30 feet. But my iPhone4 is in my hand or in purse on shoulder. What the ...Yes, these are the only two issues. Too bad these problems kind of render the headset useless more times than it should.7/28/2011Dropped Connection: I noticed this occurred when the power for iPhone4 was low. Also, past disconnects have occurred in wireless environments and that maybe a contributer as well.",3
"I had given up on finding a bluetooth headset for several years. The ones that I had tried didn't fit, felt uncomfortable, fell apart, wouldn't stay on, etc.I have very small ears -- this headset works perfectly for me. It holds together, it fits really well, and the sound quality is very good. It's so lightweight that I sometimes forget I have it on. The battery charge also holds up great & I like that when you switch it on, it tells you how much talk time is left. My iPhone 4S also shows how much charge it has.5/9/14 update: I've had this for well over a year, and it still works great, despite being shoved into different purses, glove boxes, pockets, etc. Very happy with it.",5
"OK, I'll admit it, I'm old, at least in the view of the majority of people under 60 :).  To help you understand, I learned to type on a 'manual' typewriter.  That's a typewriter without electricity!!  :)  But I LOVE technology.  I have a macbook pro, more than one iPad, iPod's, PC's and so on.  One thing I wouldn't get is a good cell phone, just wouldn't because of the monthly cost.  I do have a pay as you go phone, but that's about it.Then I discovered Straight Talk and jumped on the band wagon.  I love having my cell now and I LOVE texting.  I purchased this item hoping it'd give me hand's free talking.  How my kids love to talk...not sure where they got that :).This paired so easily to my new Galaxy S2 and even though I live in the boonies with poor cell reception, the parties on the other line could hear me loud and clear and I can hear not only hear them loud and clear, but better than I could before.Yup, gotta love technology :).  This item fits snugly, yet it's not uncomfortable.  Matter of fact, it's VERY comfortable and it's not large and unsightly.  I love that the little lady tells me how many hours I've got left on the charge.  I love the volume control, etc.  If something happens to this, I will get another.",5
This is a great bluetooth headset! I find it to be the most comfortable one I have purchased to date. I was really impressed with the ease of use and the features it included. The sound quality is fantastic and this earpiece really cuts back on the background noise. I highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a bluetooth earpiece.,4
"Connection kept going on and off. Volume is weak. The other caller hears hissing noises. Overall, the worst Bluetooth headphone I've used. This is going back to Amazon.",1
Bought this to supplant a smaller one with limited battery life. Yep. Does good.Here are the six more words required.,5
The product is really good. I ended up buying 2 more. It was for my Dad and he loves it. I really love the on and off switch. It is a good bluetooth for its price. There are like 4 colors for this bluetooth,5
"Bought this Plantronics M100 Bluetooth from amazon third-party marketplace seller Functional_Art for about fourteen dollars plus shipping for a combined total of a little under nineteen dollars. Got this bluetooth as 'Used - Very Good' but it looked new. It came with photocopied instructions but they weren't really needed too much if you've used bluetooth earpieces before. What is different about Plantronics bluetooths is that when connected to the iPhone, there is new icon in the top status bar on the iPhone display screen that is like an short icon bar that is apparently a battery indicator as to the amount of battery charge on the bluetooth. Also, what is nice about this bluetooth is that it talks to you telling you when you turn it on (and off) and how many hours talk time that you have. The power switch on this bluetooth is nice also where when it is turned off, you'll see the red/orange in the switch to tell you that this bluetooth earpiece is off, and therefore you can easily determine whether it is on or off. As a used product, it only came with one large eartip but me wish it was larger so the bluetooth would fit more snuggly in the ear without needing to use that awful over-the-ear hook thingie. Have to really jam it in the ear or it feels loose in the ear. Will probably try some other eartips although the size of the eartip included with this Plantronics bluetooth is the same size as the one that me previously got to use on my other Bumblebee Bluetooth earpiece. Otherwise, the calls seem good on this Plantronics M100 Bluetooth earpiece.",4
Perfect headset for the road and the price is worth it. If you have an Iphone I do recommend this Bluetooth.,5
"I've owned several different Bluetooth headsets in the past, and they were always lacking in one or more areas (extremely heavy, way too large, buttons hard to use, etc). This one, as far as I'm concerned, is near perfect. It's just the right size to let people know you're on the phone without looking like you're turning into a cyborg. It fits comfortably on your ear (with or without the plastic over-ear hook) and weighs next to nothing. I've honestly forgotten that I'm wearing the thing on several occasions. The sound quality is as good as I've heard from a single micro speaker. Best of all the buttons are simple, well thought out and intuitive across the board. Paired it with my phone in all of 10 seconds and I haven't looked back yet.",5
This is a very nice blue tooth at a great price. It arrived on time and it seems to work pretty good.,5
This is a great little ear bud that works just as advertised. Would recomend it to anybody and already have. They love it as well. Rate this product an A+++,5
"I was looking for something simple, inexpensive but comfortable.  I owned earlier versions of Plantronics, Jawbone and Motorola.  This is the first bluetooth headset that I tried without the over the ear loop that had a comfortable fit.  I dont get any ear canal fatigue and pain while keeping it in my ear over long periods of time.  The on/off switch makes it simple and the size is perfect, not bulky at all.",4
"There is no searching for the device. As soon as you turn it to the on position the device immediately connects to my phone. I love it so much I'm purchasing another one for my girlfriend. (It does not play music through the blutooth although). With that being said the calls come in clear and neat. Its not to big, and fits perfectly around my ear.",5
"Great sound, fits snug, second one I ordered.  I lost my first one to the car vacuum at the gas station and really went on the hunt to find this outdated headset.  It fits great in my ear and has the earlobe clip and the behind the ear clip so you have two ways to keep the headset in.  I love that it 'verbally' announces how many hours/mins of talk time is remaining, this way I truly know when to charge it.  It takes the mini-USB plug so you don't have to buy anything special, if you have any LG phones or the Android you have a plug.I plan to buy one more just in case they decide to cancel the line.  It's way to hard to find a good headset for small ears.",5
"I thought with it being so small and so cheap that it would not work or break easily, but I am surely surprised! I've had it for well over a month now and everything on it works great! I reccommend this fully to anyone who is looking for one of these! :)",4
This  adapter works did not work well for me because I have an older car and want to play music from my ipod or phone through the car speakers. It shorted out my device.,1
I was really afraid if buying this because most fm transmitters suck! and this one is no different holds a station well and i live in the city (houston) but picks up way to much static! not even worth trying save your money.,2
It worked just perfect with my ipone 4 but i wish they had something like this for iphone 5 becasue i cant find anything that worked as reat as this item so far.,5
"This item was shipped quickly, however the music does not come in clear on any station and I have to constantly move the phone around to try to get the signal to become clear. Probably would not recommend it.",3
Recieved this today and couldn't wait to try it out and was pleased with the results.  The sound quality is great and it transmitted on the first station that was listed with clearity. My daughter and husband both had me order each of them one for their vehicles after hearing what this little device can do.,5
the charger part disconnects fairly easy and doesnt charge that well. other than that it works good when you find a station that doesnt interfere,2
"pretty good product works perfectly except for some disturbance once in a while when the phone receives texts, emails, or is trying to retrieve its signal, but other than that works perfectly.",4
The charger is nice and small not heavy and great to use when your on the go or for emergencies. It does its job and the battery logo on top right is handy you push it and it shows how much battery it has left mines came sorta charged with three blue LED lights on works when I charge the battery also fits right in my pocket I would recommend this its pretty good.,5
"So I've had this product for a month now. The issue I have with it is its not made by Apple, thus the specs on the power port aren't exact. About two weeks after using it (I use it on airplanes to charge my phone when power isn't available), I noticed all the plug into the power port of my iPhone were lose. I took the phone into the Apple store and they replaced it, and said avoid this accessory, as they tend to bend the ports in the phone.I like the idea, but my phone is a $900 phone... not about to ruin another phone just to have a cheap charger.",2
I was looking for a portable power adapter for my iPod. This was inexpensive. It works great. It doubles the battery life of my iPod. Great for when I'm out and need to charge the iPod. Buy multiples- your friends and family will want one. Would be a great stocking stuffer for Christmas.,5
"It is a great idea but it dose not have very much battery life, comes unplugged from my phone, and you have to take off you're casejust to plug it in it was a big disappointment I would rather spend more a little more money then to get something that doesn't work",2
"This item was a little bulky for long term use, but was great for day travel when I didn't ha e a charging cord. Took my iPhone 4 from 20% charge to 80% charge in about an hour. Great for the price....",4
Okay so it worked fine for a month... A MONTH then it just broke. JUST BROKE I have very little words for how upset I am. I guess I should explain what I mean by it broke. It doesn't hold charge. I charged it all day a full 24 hours and it died in 5 minutes... 5 MIIINNUUTEESS yeah so I'm kind of raging over here should have just listened to ratings. No I would NOT recommend this,2
"I received this item very quickly but it was in a plastic ziplock bag. No packaging, no instructions, no removable plastic cover. Nothing but the device in a plastic bag. I thought I would receive this item in manufacturer's packaging since this is how I received another one from another Amazon vendor. I wanted to give these as gifts but can't in this packaging. And no protective plastic cover.Item does work as designed....at least the first time I tried it.",1
I actually purchased like 6 of these and gave them out as gifts everyone loves it. Myself included. It's portable and it really does power my iphone and ipod.,5
Dont waste your money on this junk product. The 1st and 2nd one they have sent me DO NOT WORK ! It wont hold a charge for more than 15 mins and wont charge the Iphone AT ALL ! DO NOT BUY !!!!!!,1
This does NOT work. I charged it overnight for over 10+ hours and it did not show a charge for my phone. This is a piece of junk and I wish I returned it. I have another charger and have no issues with it because it will show a charge on my iphone. But THIS particular Stitchway charger is JUNK!!!! It should not be that difficult to have a backup battery to recharge your iphone.,1
I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY BESTFRIEND AND HE SAID THAT YOU CAN NOT USE THIS WHILE YOU ARE ON THE PHONE BUT IT DOES WORK IF YOUR IN A PINCH.,3
This item broke within a week of using it. I was very disappointed. Would not recommend buying this product until they redesign or make it better..,1
it was ok didnt work a lot. work sometimes good for 911! or if u forget to charge your phone.,1
"For a little over 6 bucks, i have to know that it is NOT gonna be great but expect average quality.It says 1900 mAh, which means it should charge up to 80% of iPhone 4.I got about 60% at most after 2 weeks of use.Having said that, i think 6 bucks is reasonable and 60% is good.",3
"Don't let it be a cold day and you are outside---NOTHING even though it was fully charged. I have two of them the second isn't any better than the first, so it's not like I received a defective one. I thought the first was defective, the company gave me a replacement but that was the same! The customer service was good, though.. just not the charger..",3
"This thing seems to be a 'priced right' battery backup.  I have charged the thing and plugged it into my iPod and it is apparently working like advertised.  I wish it didn't cover up the earphone port while charging the iPod battery, but that is no big deal.  I plan to have this device in my pocket as I travel to Europe with my iPod next fall.",5
I gave this one to my mom as her birth day on the first of Nov and she likes it a lot to charger her phone thank you,5
I have used this many times. Its a great thing to have if you wont be by a charger. Chargers your phone real well.,5
"I've used two of these for two years and the first one died today. They have been used to charge my iPhone 4 and one charge (from 20% to 100%) just about exhausts the capacity. Best features are small size and built-in iPhone 4s and earlier connector -- will not work with iPhone 5 and beyond.  For this price, there cannot be much quality control and while mine were both good, it should not be surprising if you have to exchange a DOA. I would recommend buying two or more and returning the DOAs. If you expect more than this from a five dollar charger, you are living on the wrong planet. Much larger and more expensive chargers sold on Amazon have as much as five time the capacity and will also charge iPads. I purchased one by Jackery for that purpose and it works quite well. It does, however, require a not-included connector cable that is compatible with your device so that it will work with iPhone 5 as well as other smart phones, but not as convenient for iPhone 4 use.",5
Gives my iphone a battery boost Seems to last for a few hours and takes a few hours to load to capacityThe question is the durability and life of this battery. Too early to tell but nice low price..,5
"The MoshiMoshi04 Bluetooth Wireless Handset+Base is a unique and useful handset and speaker system for you Bluetooth equipped phone and computer.Esthetically the MoshiMoshi is very stylish, and consists of both a base and handset.  The base is covered in a rubberized material, is arc shaped, and has a solid feel to it.  The substantial rubber feet on the bottom of the base prevent the unit from sliding around.  The handset portion of the MoshiMoshi is covered in the same rubberized material as the base, and sports an aluminum front, which contains the speakers, microphones, and indicator lights.  The handset has a nice feel in the hand, but the flat shape of the aluminum faceplate makes it a little uncomfortable to use next to your ear.  On the top of the handset are three buttons, and a power button is on the rear.  Construction quality is high, however, the aluminum faceplate does not sit completely flush with the rear on some parts of the handset.  Included with the system are a few international power converters and a rubber mat to rest your phone on.  Lastly, I'd like to mention that the packaging for the MoshiMoshi is very nice.Using the MoshiMoshi is simple.  I was able to sync it up with both my MacBook (running Snow Leopard) and my iPhone4.  To sync the MoshiMoshi you press the top center button on the handset for 5 seconds.  Once the handset is paired you can use it a multitude of ways.  You can hold it to your face like a traditional phone and make a private call, or place it on the base/table and make a conference call.  When used for both private and conference calls I could hear the caller clearly and they reported no issues hearing me.  I was able to walk about 20 feet from the connected device before the call started to break-up in private call mode.  When making a conference call I had to stay within about 10 feet for the caller to make out my voice clearly.  When you receive a call and the handset is on the base you can simply pick it up and it will connect the call, to end the call just place it back on the base.  The three buttons on the top of the handset allow you to redial, swap calls, reject calls, and raise and lower the volume.  The power button allows you to switch between private/conference call modes.  The only part that was a little finicky was adjusting the volume.  Sometimes the buttons wouldn't respond right away, and when switching from private to conference call mode it does not remember the last volume level of that mode, so it could be way too loud or too soft.The unit can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker system, and I streamed music with both my iPhone and MacBook.  It worked well and the three buttons on the top of the handset allow you to play/pause and skip backwards/forwards through songs.  Sounds quality is nothing special though.  It sounds no better than a clock radio, with little bass and muffled highs.  Still, it sounds a lot better than my MacBook and iPhone's built-in speakers.  There is also a 3.5mm port covered by a plug on the handset if you want to play your music that way.Battery life is quoted at 2 hours talk/play time and that jives with my experience.  It takes 4 hours to fully charge the unit.  The handset charges whenever it is on the base.All in all... a multipurpose Bluetooth device that does most everything well.",4
"This is such a great device. It was very easy to set up and works great. I wanted something that could be set up like a house phone. I usually like to leave my cell phone charging when I am at home. So I needed something that was bluetooth and that is comfortable to use. Talking for more than ten minutes on a cellphone is so uncomfortable but with the moshi moshi it is very comfortable. It is weighted nicely and it is soft on your hands too. The sound quality is excellent even at a distance. It is also nice and loud. You can adjust the volume if it is too loud. As a speaker phone it works well too. Nice and loud for conversations but for music it is a different story. The sound is not all that great for music. It is flat and low. Overall, a great product if you need a central phone for your phone by using your cell phone.",4
"To be honest, I wasn't sure how to review this item. It took forever for me to get the blue tooth to connect for any of my gadgets. I have a current iPhone that of course has excellent blue tooth connectivity except with this item. And, my computer is less than a year old. I tried every blue tooth item I had and it was basically hit or miss.The charging of the item is also very spotty. It seems to lose a charge quickly. I searched the Internet to see if others had this problem and it seems as though you either love this item or it doesn't work according to the claims the manufacturer makes.I really wanted this handset to work. It is a great idea. Based on a phone call to the makers of the Moshi--this item probably was defective. It was a Vine choice, so I did not send it back. If it hadn't been, it would have been boxed and ready to go after the first two or three fruitless hours of many trying to get a connection.",1
"This a pretty stylish blue-Tooth handset. Quality is good and you don't have the cheap plastic stuff feeling. I wonder if this handset is more for a corporate environment....a little weird to see it at home environment.In terms of its real function, the sound quality of the speaker phone is pretty good. My friend on the other side hear me clear also...which is expected as no noise canceling function is needed in this set compared with other blue-tooth devices used in more noisier vehicle environment. The speaker phone volume is loud enough to hear across the room, which is very good for a room conference call. But, don't expect great base sound for playing music though.The price is a little high.By the way, I also run into the problem of trying to pair two devices. Not sure if this is due to Blue-Tooth compatability issue or not. However, it works pretty well if only one device is paired.",4
"The Native Union MM04 is a welcome addition to our home, the charging base travels from kitchen to office as we use it so often we like to have it in close proximity.  With it's elegant clean lines and unobtrusive size, it would work well in any room at home or in a corporate environment.The handset is large but easy to use and hear.  The instructions are clear, and bluetooth setup was easy to connect to the iPhone 4.  The packaging should win a design award right along with the product.  Including chargers for a variety of countries, this device is perfect for travelers.The speakers provide good sound for listening to everything from conference calls to podcasts to music.  It is truly a well designed and executed product that should be welcome in the market place.",5
"When I was offered the opportunity to review this product, I was SO doubtful as to its ability to do everything it advertises it will.  Actually, I was planning on giving it to my daughter, because she likes this sort of thing (the techie, modern fun stuff), and I thought it was more of a 'cutsie', nonessential item.I was wrong!As soon as I saw the packaging, I knew it was someething unique.  Modern, quality packaging, with fancy embellishment and soft, 'not cheap' box...hard to explain, but you know when you open it that the manufacturer took the time to see to the smallest of detail.Taking it out of the box, it has the softest, smoothest feel to it!  (I actually made the comment that it felt sensual in my hand.)  It set up quickly and connected to my HTC Touch Pro 2 without incident (actually, my phone found it and between the two units, it did all of the set up by itself).It took about 2 hours to charge completely.I live in a place where my cell service does NOT work in my house.  I have to put my phone on the windowsill to get a simple text message, and it has NEVER worked well enough to connect with my different bluetooth earpieces, even when it's on the windowsill.  I usually have to walk to the end of the driveway to be able to use the bluetooth earpiece, and in the driveway itself for the phone.  I didn't think this unit was going to do me much good, but was willing to give it a try.I didn't even realize it was charged and working until it rang!  I was so surprised!  So I answered it with the speakerphone ready to tell the caller that I was going to have to call them back on the landline since my service was so bad--but the call was clear both from my end and their end.  I was shocked.Making a call was super, as well.  I was able to call out easily and the calls are SO clear.  The handset feels so comfortable in your hand.The ONLY drawback to the handset is that it's so 'perfect', it's hard to remember which end is the earpiece and which is the microphone...but I'm sure in time I'll get used to that.The buttons are easy to use, easy to see, and not 'too easy' to access (you don't hit the buttons on accident).  I love the colors of the LEDs.  This unit is SO pretty--very modern--but not obtrusive.The speakers sound great and are loud enough to hear across the room (and into the next).  There are different rings that you can set up, and you can even pair this with multiple devices.We have two different cell phones in the house and each one paired easily (the other is a Blackberry).Volume is easy to adjust.  The directions and paperwork are easy to read, easy to follow.  The abilities of this unit are far above what I would ever regularly use (mp3 player, for instance), but in an office setting (or even while cooking in the kitchen), are very valuable.  Using my smartphone to its fullest capacity is finally something I am interested in doing (mp3 wise).Suffice to say, my daughter is NOT getting this...I LOVE it!  I am thinking, though, that this would make a GREAT gift for college students (like my daughter) or professionals--or anyone who uses their cell as their primary phone.  It seems expensive at first, but really, it's fabulous!",5
"If you are looking for a bluetooth handset that also looks stylish, then this is definitely one to get.  Build quality is superb and the weight really feels good and solid in your hand.  Bluetooth pairing was fairly simple and sound quality was great - this would make a great gift for the gadget lover who has everything, or for the executive office.  The price is kinda high, but the quality and style are a-one.",4
"This is a unique product that I found useful for conference calls from home.  I telework part time and often my cell is where people hit me first. For short conference calls and the like, using this instead of talking into my phone is a great utility.  Bluetooth streaming music from my phone to the device is also great! I love it as a speaker. I've been able to reduce the number of devices/speakers/phones on my desk and make things quite clutter free.As a phone those, I really didn't find myself picking it up.  It is a beautiful piece of solid art and technology like no other. If you want an office centerpiece or conversation piece, you've found it in this product. If you want something you use extensively and you talk on the cell constantly, this could also be very useful to you.Because I did initially have the bluetooth 'paired then unpaired' issue that another reviewer mentioned, I docked a star for simplicity-- I did have to pair it more than twice to keep the pairing-- and there is only as much feedback as you get from a bluetooth earpiece -- which is not much.Finally-- I wasn't able to bluetooth pair it with my PC because the PC didn't seem to have a driver available for it.  I contacted support about this but they basically told me to 'let us know if you find a fix! :) ' which wasn't all that pleasing, but you'll have that.Overall, a good device, it will fit the needs of a certain niche perfectly, but may not present the value that the average consumer wants for the purchase of a product.",4
"The new design for a Blackberry charger is small and it looks pretty but it has one notable design/functional flaw which should be considered when shopping for an additional Blackberry (or generic) USB charger.Briefly, the slot where the USB cable plugs in is on the side rather than on top - like the official Kindle USB charger - or in front. Therefore, if you want to plug it into a power strip it's mandatory that it's plugged on the last outlet, either on the left or on the right because there would be no room for the USB cable otherwise. Another issue - don't know if it's a problem - is that the plug is not grounded (2-pronged plug) but the makers of Blackberry apparently have concluded that this should be okay and my Blackberries and everything else I charged on it survived so far.Anyone who can live with the above should find the adapter as good as any other USB charger. Here are its good features, besides 'pretty':- Compact - up until recently, chargers used to be extra-wide and sometimes prevented the use of outlets to their left or right on a power strip. This one is the right size, for as long as it's the last one on the left or on the right.- Generic (universal) - it can be used to charge just about any Blackberry and many other gadgets that charge through a Micro or a Mini USB port - I am using it with a Kindle and a couple of Bluetooth headsets and MP3 players. Note that the reverse is also true. I am routinely charging my Blackberries (currently have a Bold and a Torch) off the Kindle charger and everything else can be charged with the Bold's 'old school' big charger.- Modular - like Kindle's charger, this one will work with any Type A male to Micro-B or Mini USB male cable.- Inexpensive - for a 'branded' charger. There are lots of one-dollar generic USB chargers around but you always take a gamble with those and Kindle's own is a little more expensive.To conclude, if one concern is 'power strip clutter' and price doesn't matter, the best USB charger is Kindle's. If price and quality are the main concerns, this may very well be 'the one' to get. Or, if you have some older charger lying around and you don't mind 'older' you may not need this at all.Remember, you will probably need to supply your own USB cable or look for the version that comes with the cable included.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",4
"This is a great plug. It is cheaper than most generic plugs, yet it will work with pretty much anything. It's 750mA, so it's not quite strong enough to charge some smart phones (iPhone takes 1000mA), so it may work, but it would be a slower charge. I ordered this from Amazon (not one of the resellers) and it is OEM and legitimate. I don't know why anyone would order from a reseller when Amazon sells the same item, even if they are a few bucks more expensive. If you want a faster charge for your blackberry or want to charge a micro-usb tablet, purchase the Playbook Folding Blade Charger (about twice the cost, but still inexpensive):Blackberry Folding Blade Charger for Playbook - Charger - Retail Packaging - Black",5
"I bought 2 of these. They work just fine. I have had no problems at all. I would buy more if I lost mine. It can be used for any USB item, not just apple. I use this with my Verizon iPhone 4.",5
"I have an OEM USB charger from RIM and I purchased three of these units from this merchant. I tend to agree with another reviewer that there is a difference between the OEM version and these (I uploaded the pic of the close-up on the charger specs). These are good knock-offs in terms of looks, but, they function differently than the OEM that I've had. The OEM version will charge my iPad. The ones purchased here will not.These will, however, charge my Blackberry 9650 as it is designed to do (and it charges my iPhone just fine as well). In fairness, the fine print does rate the USB port as 5w (an iPad requires 10w; just not sure why the original unit I had charges the iPad).  I would like to see all manufacturers disclose the electrical specs of these items.  It would certainly cut down on the uncertainty, frustration, and wasted energy on returned items.As for longevity of this product, time will tell.",3
"I used this overnight with my Apple iPod Touch. The power plug stayed cool, which inspires confidence.I like the compact size of this plug. It does not monopolize a wall socket or power strip. Plus, it looks nice.My plug did NOT ship with cables. This is not a complaint, just a comment regarding other reviews right here.",5
"I purchased this due to its size. I'm a gadget guy and have lots of stuff that charge VIA USB so tend to buy these to leave all over the house :) This charges my iPhone4, iPhone3GS, and Iphone 3G. I was also curious if it would charge my iPad, and it did :) Although the iPad states its not charging, it does. I had my ipad at %40 before i went to bed and was %100 when I woke up. Used this several times with the iPad and same result (charged). I have tried other chargers as well and ones that are rated at under 1A are the ones that the iPad states that it is not charging. But it does :) I also like the fact that i can still use my other wall port due to its tiny size. I gave it 5 stars cause it wasn't meant to charge an iPad that normally charges with a 2A charger but it does and the size and price is great.",5
This is one of my favorite little products. They are great adapters for a USB that will take your Blackberry from work to home without having to have two chargers.,5
GREAT deal on a real RIM accessory.  Got this to replace one I lost on vacation.  It is EXACTLY like my original.,5
"This is just another great way to charge your phone at home or on the go without alot of bulk, just plug your micro usb cable in and you done. The price makes it well worth having.Small enough to keep one at work or take on a trip without taking up alot of space.",5
Fits a Droid X without trouble.  Even with a snap on rubber case the phone is easily inserted or removed from it.  Very well made.,5
"I tend to wear out leather cases pretty quick due to the abuse it takes while on my hip.  For the price, these cannot be beat!",4
"I just received this (very timely delivery), and am already impressed.  My Droid X fits nicely in the pouch, and looks like it will also be a good fit if/when I put anOtterBox Defender Case(or similar)on the Droid.  Even if it doesn't fit, I wouldn't downgrade the rating on this pouch though.  I also like that it has belt loops as well as a belt clip. The loops will keep the pouch secure on my belt, without concern of it coming off. I ride a motorcycle, and although I've never lost a phone due to the clip sliding off the belt, it's always been a concern.If you're looking for a good belt pouch for your Droid, I would not hesitate to recommend this one.**********Got myOtterBox Defender Case for Motorola DROID X MB810 (Black).  Unfortunately, once that is on, the Droid X no longer fits.  I mean, it will go in, but you can't completely close it, and then getting the phone out is a chore.  Without theDefenderon, it's a great pouch.",5
"This case is high quality, stays secure on belt and my Galaxy Samsung Note 2 fits perfectly. Still looks good after several months of use.",5
"Top quality.  It's the touches that makes this case excel. And yes, Toto, the magnet will turn on the car mode....",5
excellent quality for the price..soft leather and very stylish for a man..My husband really likes the product and the stylish look it gives,5
This pouch is very nice. I got it to use with my Droid X in a protective case. Unfortunately it barely fits the Droid X without the case. It does fot my Droid Incredible in a protective case. It is very dressy looking and has a good clip,4
Reiko cases have always been good to me.  Using it every day it will last about 7-9 months.  That may not seem like a long time but most other cases last 3-4 months then fall apart.  Using it with a samsung focus windows phone with hard case and it fits well.,5
Nice pouch for my husband's iPhone 4S. He has been using it since last 4 months. No complaints yet!A very well made case. Stays on belt all day long.,5
"This holster is of good quality. I ordered this for a Motorola Droid X.It is a little tight for the Droid X, but does not activate any buttons.My Droid X does occasionally go into docking mode, in this holster.The only con, is not the fault of the holster, but is caused by the size of the phone. This holster is sizable, especially when driving with a seat belt on. This is not a problem, but may be note worthy.Another item worth mentioning; while the belt loops will accept a belt width of 2.5 inches, it will not accept double layers of thick belts. This may limit which side it can be mounted.",4
"This Leather Cell Phone Protective Case is an excellent fit for my HTC Incredible 2 smartphone. The phone fits into the case snug, but without having to force it fit. Of course, the phone also has a rubber protective glove. Without it, the fit may be too loose.",5
"It's hard to get my Droid in and out of this case.  Last time I got this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XKVMA6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_12and it worked great until my husband's dog ate it.  I like the design of this one better, but it doesn't fit the same.  The price is great though.",3
This cell phone pouch is exactly what it was described as.  I love it.  My Droid2 fits perfectly with the protective skin on it.,5
"Holds a Droid X comfortably.  Not to tight, not too lose.  Great value.  You would spend close to $30 for a similar product at a cell phone store.",5
This case fits perfectly for my Droid X cell phone.  It is very well made and easy to use with the phone.,4
Very well made and great protection for the phones.  You can clip it on or pass your belt through it's loops.,5
"This case fit my phone perfectly.  It's handy to use, and seems to be of good quality. I like the fact that it's as easy to reach the phone as if it were in my pocket, but the phone is protected.",4
I am a new Droid owner.  The large size is welcome on the eyes but kinda bulky for my front pocket.  I like to keep the gel protective case on the phone to protect it but like many add on's I feared that I would have to take it out of the case to make it fit in this case.  Fear not:  It slipped in the case without any problems.  Snug fit but not tight or difficult to take out.  Will add some extra protection as well.  Clip is strong enough to hook on jeans pocket.  $6-$7 price (incl ship) makes it an easy choice.  Nice looking case with clean stitching well made.  Perfect for my needs.5/20/11 Update:  The clip for attaching to pants with no belt now falls off with little pressure.  I can only use this with a belt.  Otherwise the product still looks great with no mfg flaws.,5
I don't why I bought this. A waste of money.  Just by an otter box. This thing is weird. Waste of money for me.,1
"has a clip - to hook on if you don't want to remove your belt.also has a belt loop -- if you want to take the time and really KNOW that this cannot be dislodged from your side.The magnet closure is firm enough (as is the snug fit in the case) to prevent the phone from coming out of the case.And the magnet has not caused any problems for my Droid X2. It does not cause the Droid to go into 'dock' mode nor to turn on, now matter how I place it in the case, though I normally place it with screen to the outside.I get a good fit despite using theQmadix Gel for Motorola MB810 DROID X Flex (Black)- it still fits just fine.  You can't beat the price.",5
"Very fast shipping. I got it days before I was expecting it. Very nice case, fits my Droid X nicely. It even fits in there with this case, [...]Very much worth the $7.00 I paid. This case would sell in cell phone stores for $25 or more.EDIT: After using a couple days I'm ready to order another one to have for when I wear this one out, which I will even though it's a high quality pouch. Another thing, the spring belt clip holds VERY securely on just the waistband of my jeans, if used with a leather belt, this thing isn't coming off unless you pull it off.EDIT again: I ordered a second pouch and I did not get the exact same one. It was slightly smaller and useless. I guess it's a crap shoot with this vendor.EDIT: I've had this case for almost two years now and it's holding up just fine. It is starting to show it's age, though but that's to be expected. I'd like to get another one just like it but as my second edit stated, I'm not sure if ordering this again will get me the exact same thing. I had a Droid X when I bought this case and now have a Droid Razr Maxx HD and even though this new phone is a little bit bigger, it still fits fine.",5
"I bought a Reiko carrying case a few years ago. I really liked it, but it finally wore out.  So, without hesitation, I ordered this one. So, why did I drop the rating to 3 stars? Perhaps I just got a bad one, but the problem is with the flap. On my first one, there was a very strong magnet, and it stayed closed. I've had to stick some velcro to this one to keep the flap closed. When I ride my motorcycle, I like to know the phone will stay in it's case. Without the velcro, I can't be sure I can count on it. The flap just does not stay closed.Overall, it seems to be well made, but the lack of a strong closure really hurts it. I will try another one sometime (can't beat the price), and if it fails as this one, I will try another make later.",3
i dont know if its real leather or not but i still cant believe its this cheap. it works great and does not feel like its a $2.xx product,5
"For the price and china made, it is what it is. I can't be mad at it. doesn't last long if you are carrying your phone in it and doing labor intensive jobs. It'll fray and break down quick. Everyday regular use, it'll get the job done.",3
"I really like the leather hoister for my phone I got from Amazon, I use it when I am not at work and it make the phone eaiser to get too.",5
Very happy with order.  Only took a few days from order to delivery.  I usually do not like to order leather over the internet because of the different types of leather but this is very soft and my husband is happy.  Thats what counts.  I would buy again from this seller.,5
"I had back luck with several other manufacturer's products, but I finally found a nicely manufactured product with this one!  I have had it for a few months so far, and it is holding up nicely.I got it for my Motorola Triumph, and it fits perfectly (not too tight - just right), and it is holding up perfectly!!",5
This is the best case you can buy for the money. It's fits perfect to the phone. small and styling. love the way it makes the phone look.,5
"This was a nice case, and perhaps I just got one that happened to fall through the cracks of quality control... but the vinyl really fell apart quickly. Was unusable only after a couple of months. I purchased a body glove case after that and it has been great for me for over a year since.",2
"I have the Droid X by Motorola and I originally had the Motorola holster designed specifically for the DX, but it broke after 3 weeks of use. After reading the review left by Michael, I decided to go ahead and purchase this pouch. Finding a generic case/pouch was near impossible since the DX is a little bigger than most cell phones. I received the item yesterday and opened it right away. The first thing I did was slide my phone into the pouch and closed it to check for fit. My DX fit perfectly; if I shake the pouch, I do not feel the phone move at all; it's that snug! It is exactly what I wanted.Two things I will note.1. The stitching on my pouch is not white, it's black. So to me, it looks even better than the one pictured.2. The little rectangular logo (REIKO)is not present on my pouch. It is actually impressed in the leather, making it much more visually appealing.I would definitely recommend this to DX owners!!UPDATE 10/12/2010:The users that have reported that their Droid X will not fit in this case (or having to force their Droid X into the case) are definitely not reviewing the same case that I received. The pictures that are shown for product view are of my actual case as well as my actual Droid X. If you receive your case and it has a tag that indicates 'iPhone' anywhere on the tag, DO NOT OPEN IT! Return it to Amazon and have them correct it. Also, do a visual inspection before opening. The Droid X and HTC Evo are large and will not fit most cell phone cases. Put your phone up to it and visually compare the size of the case to the size of your phone. If you have any doubt, you are better off just returning the case.",5
This carrying case was the perfect fit for my droid x. It has a magnet type thing that closes the flap and prevents my phone from falling.  I really like that the droid x is a perfect fit for the case therefore reducing the chances of it sliding out.,5
Fits perfectly with battery case. Has loops in the back to secure to your belt. Not like the clip on type that may slip out. Also has a magnetic flap which is a plus since velcro will loosen after a while.,5
I have been using this for nearly 2 years now. for at least 5-6 days a week. I used it for my Galaxy S II and now Nexus 4. It holds both really well and is very durable.,5
"I've been using a Verizon pouch with my Droid X, but I've been a bit concerned that the clip would break off.  So I bought one of these cases given the reviews were generally positive and it looked like a good design.  I'm impressed, the quality is very good, my Droid X fits perfectly, and it attaches to my belt securely even without using the loops.",5
"I have purchased 8 of these now. A few for me and some for friends. I put my large Dell Venue Pro Windows phone in it and it holds it securely no matter what I do. The sideways orientation is great because I can sit and stand and crouch and it never matters. Getting into and out of the car was always an issue with clip-on holders because they would catch. Not this one. It stays tight whether clipped to my belt or with my belt looped through it. I use it outside, when gardening, when running - everywhere. The elements don't bother the case at all and the phone stays dry. The top flap closes well with a slight magnetic catch and it does not pop open, ever, but is easily lifted. I put a smaller flip-phone into it and it works just as great. I alaso put a Blackberry Pearl into it, same thing. If you want simple, long-lasting and inexpensive - buy this.",5
"I received this case after looking for one for three months.  The case is a great fit, I have the Amzer Luxe Argyle skin on my Droid X and it fits in the case perfectly.  The case is a nice look and rather well made.My only complaints are that the magnetic closure activates the car dock on the phone about 30%of the time.  I find that it activates more when I wear the case in such a way that it has pressure put on the outside of it making it closer to the phone.  My only other complaint is that my particular case started to come apart on the side stiching near the elastic on one side.  It appears that  a stitch either popped or missed it loop and the stiching started to come undone.  I repaired this with a need and thread and sealed the edge with some anti fray from a sweing kit.  I do not think that this is an inherent problem in the case.This is the only case that fit my phone properly, would recommend with some caution as to the magnet and the stitching.",4
The case is perfect for my needs.  The clip is sturdy enough to hold onto my duty belt and the case is big enough to hold my Droid X along with it's protective case.,5
"I love this item. It is of a very good quality, it is built to last and is great for the price.",5
"Was a little doubtfull if it would fit the iPhone 4 with Otter Defender, but worked out fine. A little too big but not to bother about. Quality OK, has been on my belt now for a month. Had another one that only lasted a week!",4
My Motorola Droid X fits perfectly in this.  The quality is excellent.  I can't believe the price on this.  I wore it clipped to my jeans today.  The clasp is magnetic and stays closed.  No issues.  You can't go wrong on this for the price.,5
"High quality and it fits an iPhone5 with installed Balistic case.Soft smooth inside, tough outside. Much better quality than available in the mall (or on the street).",5
I cannot stress enough how useful these little suckers are for fixing iphones and other widgets. The quality seems decent enough.  Some fasteners that come with furniture and stuff are so cheap & strip out easily. These seem to be alright.,5
"Well, just like everything else in life receiving a bag full of perfectly fitting screws is always good. Good fit= good screw",4
dint really need them but the great thing about this seller who sold them to me was that it came with a free yes free set of magnetized screwdrivers  i though that  was great fantastic terrific ect.i would definetly buy this item just for the free screwdrivers which by the way the quality of them were superior than any of those other so called set for fixing phones.,5
the iphone 3G screws are great buys.Came newv as they said.The package was packed good.The order was as great as the offer.,5
These screws are very helpful when you lose some after taking apart your iPhone for repairing parts. I lost a couple.  The best place to put the screws now is in an egg carton. up one side for the one side and down the other side for the other side.,5
"Well, while opening my iPhone 3G, I've lost some of the screws, and needed to find good replacement ASAP. The screw set came fast, and it's 32PCS set.Highly recommend it! :)",5
This case protects my phone 360 degress.  It is worth the price.  It is a misfortune is is discontinued by Otterbox.,4
Theres nothing bad I can ever say about any Otterbox Products.  This is one of them.  I had dropped my phone a good 10 feet and my phone wasn't even harmed.  This is actually one of my first Otterbox Cases and now I don't ever buy anything else.,5
great item,5
"There was a promotion going on at the time I bought this, so I ended up paying $15 for it! It is a good case, not worth more than $35. The worst thing is the watermark on the screen. Ive tried everything to get rid of it, but I can't. It doen't bother me, and it's probably something you get used to know, but I know it's there, so I tried my best to remove it. It offers great protection and the included holster is cool! I would recommend it!",4
"This is a dream case and the cost was cheap, easy to apply and compliments my cell phone and great to have in my collection.",4
"Received it today and its exactly what I needed. I had a different brand case just like this one before for my 3Gs but that case didnt work well with my Iphone 4 as the camera hole didnt line up but this one fits pefectly. I like to carry my phone in my jeans pocket facing out when I'm not working and this does just that. You cant beat the price anywhere. Retail stores charge $10 - $25 for a case just like this with a clip. Its why I love Amazon so much. Great product, durable and lasting and does what I wanted it to. Recommended if you want a case for the Iphone 4 thats easy to use and makes the phone accessible without taking it out of the case for a call or using the camera.",5
These are so inexpensive.  I break about 3 a year.  I bought a more expensive clip and it broke just as easy.  NEVER had the phone fall out or unclip.  Holds it firmly-I'm just rough on clips.,5
it worked ok the clip didnt hold very well fell of belt a couple of times but worked good other than that,4
I was very happy at first with this case(3 months) but am now starting to have issues. The first issue is that if you try to take a flash picture with the case on it will wash out around the top of the picture. The case is making part of the flash reflect back into the picture. Today I dropped the phone from about a foot off the ground and it snapped off one of the corner pieces that hold the phone into the case.  I love having a front facing holster but this is not the one if you are very active.,3
It was not what I espect  I did not like it it expose the screen and I don't like it no protection,3
Now I know where my phone is at all times.  Clips to everything when and where I need it.  Thanks,5
It's exactly as you see it.  it's easy to install and works great.  I love it and would recommend it.,5
"After rating their product, they understood I was unhappy with my purchase.They recently offered to give me my full refun. Thanks Eforcity!",4
I totally love this case. It fits my phone perfectly and it's an awesome green color. I would totally recommend to others,5
"I've purchased several of the LG 840G silicon covers in the past, but this one is the first that fit all the openings perfectly. I may order a second one for our other phone.",5
"Loose case, does not hug the phone. It does get the job done however.If you want a cheap case I would recommend it.",3
"The reviewers that said that this is not a very snug fit are correct.  It does not stay on very well. However I must say the holes for the camera and such are accurate.  The overall feel of the case is nice, however as previously mentioned the rubber feel of the case does indeed prevent easy access pulling the phone out of a pocket(with the case still on the phone completely).I would not say that I am inclined to return this however, it will do for a while until I can find another case, and it wasn't very expensive to begin with.",3
It's an alright case if you want to protect the outer shell.  thumbs up from me.,5
"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S. This fits great and feels great. However, it definately dulls the sound alot. In fact unless the phone is right next to me, I can not hear it ringing even when its on full volume.",3
Pretty good case for the price. Provides good protection and secure grip. The bumps over the volume control are very small and hard to locate by touch. Making these buttons larger would make the case much better.,4
I got this product fast in about 3 days it came just like the description says. Even if I drop the phone the case still works. For the price is definitely worth it.,4
"I have both the TMobile black silicone case as well as this, and this one fits as well as the more expensive case for a lot less. The cutouts for the camera, speaker, mic, headphone jack and USB port line up fine, with enough room to not impede plugging something in. I am partial to smooth cases, and the Tmobile one is textured. I would buy another one, maybe next time in a different color.",5
"I used this case for a week before replacing it with a hard shell protective case.  There's no question the silicone case must offer better shock resistance.  But the negatives were just too problematic for me.  First, the silicone is sticky, in that it has great friction against other materials.  Makes it tough to insert and remove from one's pocket.  Second, it collects all manner of grime and tiny particles of cruft that are difficult to remove.  In a day or two the black case looked dingy and grey.  The hard case replacing this silicone case still looks good months later.I suspect these complaints are endemic to the silicone material.  In all other respects, this particular case was good.  It fit well, and would no question offer better protection if dropping the phone on a hard surface.",2
good product but i ordered the otterbox defender series case to protect the samsung. paid more but i have my samsung galaxy s 4g for two years now without any damage.,3
"Are these the worst screensavers I have ever used? Yes but what can you expect for 64 cents? The item arrived in  a few days out of PA and beat the estimated arrival time.I have tried several screens savers over the years and I had more air bubbles with these ones than w/ any other that I've used. I wasted the first one because if you don't put it on just right it sticks a little outside of the screen. That can happen with almost any screensaver but it seemed worse on these ones. I had to cut the corners, as well.I would probably buy these again because you get 3 and you can't beat the price. If you want a professional, thick screen saver then go buy one of the nicer ones. But if you just need something basic and don't mind the air bubbles then I would buy them. I personally don't need anything fancy so it works for me.",3
I got this in a very timely manor and they have held up through everything. I would recommend this pack for every droid.,5
These are good screen protectors they aren't the cheap kind that have all kinds of air bubbles in them no matter what you do...very pleased,5
"The screen protector fits perfectly on my Droid 2 Global, but I am not entirely satisfied. First off, when I applied the protector, there was a little piece of something stuck to the protector. This caused a raised bubble area and I cannot remove it because it is stuck to the protector. Honestly, I looks like lint from the cloth that came with the protector (which is pretty crappy). Also the phone is designed with a sensor to tell when it is up to your ear, but this protector messes with that sensor and causes my phone screen to stay off when in a call (which makes hanging up annoying).My solution:Carefully cut the top of the protector off (the side with the speaker hole) so that there is no excess material in front of the sensor (My pull tabs were on the bottom so there was no problem there)Then clean the edges of the protector before removing the film to make sure that there are no fibers, dust or any other objects that might cause side bubbles.Otherwise follow Sarah's directions (The helpful review). Again my protector wasn't too big, it just interfered with the sensor and had lint from the included cleaning cloth. The protector is very clear and for the price it was worth the little bit of hassle. If you mess it up the first time, you still have 2 more tries for under a buck. :)Pros:ClearProtectsCHEAP!Cons:Crappy clothBubble removal tool is a joke (use a credit card)Had to modify",4
Been on my Droid for a very long time and can't even tell its there. Wonderful since it helps keeps my screen clean.,5
"I was looking for a Screen Protector for my Motorola Driod 2 Global.  First time buying from The OEM Shop.Bought it for $1.55 and it arrived in the mail in about 7 days.The Crystal Clear Screen Protector fits perfectly on my Driod 2 Global.Good product, Cheap Price, and on time delivery(5-7 days).This was my first experience with The OEM Shop, the product is just like as advertised and arrived on time.  I would definitly buy from them again.",5
This product is great.  It's easy to put on and protects very well.  I would recomend it to my family and friends.,4
"I purchased two packs and between myself and another co worker, we have yet to go through them over a long period of tiem. teh scratch resistance of these is fantastic.",5
It was a cheap screen cover so I bought it and it does exactly what a cheap screen cover will do. The screen protector scratches easily and provide a strange sort of friction when being used. But I'm just using it for now while I wait for my new skinomi skin to come in.,3
they are good but the only thing is when you get the protecter on.. you have to take the other paper off. and it wont all come off. so you have to find a way to remove it without messing up the protecter,3
"I ordered the screen protectors, with promises to receive them within a week. They hadn't arrived 3 weeks later so I contacted the company, they appologized and said they would ship out a new batch... Then several weeks later they emailed me and said that actually they were out of stock, they couldn't send the replacement. Sure woulda been nice to not create a 2 month process of receiving screen protectors, I wasn't expecting that when I signed up... that is for sure.",1
Great they fit perfect. love the them easy to out on no problems cant wait to get more when I need them. will order from them again. Thank you so much,4
"So far (1 day in) it does what it is supposed to do, but not right out of the box.I don't know if if differs for Droid 1 phones, but for a Droid 2 you have to trim about 1.5mm off each corner for it to fit the screen.a minor annoyance, but worth mentioning.",3
"I was unable to use it as it didn't fit my droid. I guess it was my fault as I didn't realize at the time there were different droids. I tried to give them away, but they didn't fit anybodies droids either. I eventually threw them away.",1
Used these like they are going out of style.  I had three phones on my wireless plan and everyone used them.,5
"Screen protectors were identical to those purchased from Verizon, at a MUCH better price. Perfect fit. Verizon no longer carries products for the Droid2 because there have been at least 3 newer verizons of the Droid since I bought mine. State of the art already obsolete!",5
"Given I didn't want to spend $15 at verizon to pick up some spare screen guards, this was a steal. They seem to be of the same quality or comparable quality as in the verizon store, yet significantly cheaper in cost. Expected delivery was 9/2/11 and I got it today, 9/1/11. Thanks for the great deal. I recommend these to anyone else who has a droid2 or droid2global.",5
It is a great product for the droid I found it easy to apply and it lasted a long time!,5
I don't know what I was expecting for the bottom bargain price but I still was hoping to be able to see my phone somewhat clearly and with this screen protector that wont happen. I ensured I cleaned the screen prior to application and even let my phone set without using it hoping it would adhere better but I ended up with a foggy looking screen.,1
love these screen covers. fits my droid2 perfect. easy to use and good quality for the price of a coffee.,5
Fits well and has stayed on the phone screen. No scratches on it thus far so the material appears to be pretty strong stuff.,5
works great and protects screen.,5
these are hard to apply to the phone.  they are not nice at all.  seem very cheap.I would pay a bit more and get something worthwhile,2
"Watched a video on youtube on how to put on a screen protector. Most useful tip was to shut the device off for 10 - 15 minutes before applying the screen protector, in order to minimize bubbles. There was a cheap cloth included, to clean the DROID 2, but I used a nicer microfiber cloth instead. With the DROID 2 cool & clean, I peeled off the first layer partially, lining up the screen protector on the face of the DROID 2. Once I was happy with the placement, I laid it down. A few small bubbles were easily removed with a credit card. I peeled off the 2nd layer, and voila, screen protector installed in very little time, with no issues.So, how does it work? I haven't scratched it yet, but it does show fingerprints; more than the original Gorilla glass. Seems to hold the oil from fingers in more than the glass. I don't know how well this will protect the Gorilla glass, as Gorilla glass is pretty tough to begin with. I guess an added layer of protection can't hurt, but at this price, the protection is probably pretty minimal.So for the price,and free shipping, I guess it's alright. I'll give it a try.",3
"the item arrived exactly as advertised, I am very happy with the product and it fits my phone as needed",5

"My fingers don't slide on these protectors very well. It protects the phone, don't get me worng and they are easy to install but it just feels weird.",3
"Although the battery appears to be OEM (same stickers and build quality as the original battery that came out of my Cosmos), I have serious doubts about the advertised claim that this is a new battery.  The low price must be considered with that information in mind.My reasons are two-fold.1. The battery came in a little plastic sleeve with a 'tested' sticker on it and a bar code.  That suggests that it went through a refurbishment/testing service, rather than being a new OEM part.2. When I originally got the Cosmos, it would last upwards of a week on a single battery charge.  My original battery had degraded to holding a charge for less than 24 hours, and this replacement battery is an improvement over that, but it's only a moderate improvement: 2 or 3 days tops.  That suggests, again, that it's not a new battery, especially considering my daily phone usage and where the phone is kept (e.g. how much it searches for signal) haven't changed in that 3 year period.",2
"Needed to replace my existing battery that was starting to show its age and was pleasantly surprised to see the exact battery in this shipment that matched mine to a 'T', right down to the labels. It was a quick easy install. Pay attention to details because like all new batteries the instructions recommend you fully charge this battery and fully deplete it 3X to achieve full capacity. This not mandatory if you are in a hurry... but, following instructions will increase the lifespan and the length of time you can use the battery before it needs charging. I AM THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE AND",5
Identical to the battery it came with and does the job.  Too bad they burn out after a year... but that's the deal,5
My phone did good after i change the Battery out and got the new one it's held charge alot better then it has been.,3
The battery brought my phone back to life after I my phone was accidently thrown in the wash.  My phone is turnin' and burnin' now.,5
The Cosmos/Octane battery arrived very quickly.  The price is great and so far I am very pleased.  I would recommend it to anyone.,5
Just need to get a couple more months out of my Mom's old phone then I can switch her over to my family plan,5
"Product works well in my wife's LG phone.  She was having problems with short battery life on her existing battery, and this has addressed that issue.",5
"I needed a longer life battery for my Droid Incredible and got these because of the price.  I'll say that you get what you pay for but in the same breath... I don't regret this purchase.  I changed the operating system on my Droid to a vanilla Android but still struggled to make the day with the heavy use I subjected my phone to.  Since I could just swap batteries, having 2 with the additional charger seemed a logical option.Condition them properly and you'll find that you got a great product",4
This was a life saver for this phone. The phone uses so much battery I always carried one battery on me and one in the charger. The battery life is consistent with the original battery and it doesn't make the phone any heavier or hotter.If your battery life is not lasting long enough this is a very good solution.,5
"I bought these batteries here from Amazon, and I love them. They last about 2-3 hours longer than the stock battery that came with my EVO. I looked at getting either the official Sprint 2600 mAh battery, or the Seidio 3500 mAh battery, but I've invested money in cases for my EVO as it is, and didn't want that to be a waste. These batteries fit very snugly into the device, and the back does snap shut, so no worries about having to buy a new back!Once you receive them, I would recommend draining each of the batteries (to somewhere between 5%-8%) and then charging them in the wall charger. I've noticed that charging these batteries in the phone, isn't very effective because the phone charges them to 1500mAh, instead of 1800mAh. So just know that you'll be swapping out these batteries for a few days, while they are conditioned. If you elect to keep it in the phone, just no that when the LED turns green, you will need to unplug it and then plug it back in and let it charge for another hour or so, to top it off. Typically when the LED turns green, the battery is only about 80% charged with these batteries (because the phone only recognizes the 1500mAh stock battery value).Now, here's a real kicker. If you buy these from Amazon, you have to pay for shipping. If you buy these directly from the seller website (htcexpress.com) you will find more buying options and free shipping. You can get just a battery (20 bucks), 1 battery + wall charger (27 bucks) or 2 batteries + charger (34 bucks). Either way, the seller ships these things fast. I received mine in 2 days after purchasing it.In short, these batteries are totally worth the purchase. They hold a charge really well, when charged in the wall charger. The wall charger does take a long time, but I believe it's a much more effective charge. The LED on the charger turns from purple to blue, when it is done charging.",5
I would anything this company makes cause these batterys last a long time! These are one of the best battery up here i mean the BEST!!!! If you need a battery this is the one!!,5

"I bought this a while back, and I am STILL using it. The batteries still last a good full day each unless heavily gamed on. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to friends, heck.. anyone that needs it for that matter. Great Value for the price!",5
"I have had this item for a couple of months now and an very please with it.  I am never without battery backups and can charge a battery and two devices ( phone, ipad, ipod, etc) at the same time.  Too bad they dont make this for my hubbys phone.",5
Both my partner and I purchased this product for our new HTC Evo's and are using these batteries now instead of the original 1500mah battery. Gives us more juice. Would love to buy the 3500mah battery for the ultimate juice if someone would make a case for the Evo with the larger battery. Until then we are happy with these batteries and a little more life. Good deal for 2 batteries and a charger. Product arrived quickly. Would purchase again.,5
They work great! Probably my old batteries were dying because my phone running twice as long with these! So far i love it!,5
"Here's what I was getting with my stock battery:6-8 hours on heavy use8-10 hours on medium use10-12 on light use12+ on very light useThe most I ever got was 17 hours and that was very, very light use with 7 of those hours being when I was asleep.On the first charge cycle, I already noticed a difference with these batteries. I use the app Battery History to see my battery usage. On only the 2nd charge cycle, I was able to get around 10.5 hours at 58.5% usage and have 8% battery left. For me, that's a very high usage. 30% is low and 40% is medium. In comparison to the stock battery, I can also get 10 hours but with light usage of 30%. I can only imagine easily getting 15+ hours with light use. It just seems to hold the charge a lot better. Even with under 10% it doesn't 'race-to-die' like the stock battery. I don't remember the stock battery ever being this good even during the first month. I was tempted to get the $20 1500 mAH package instead but this one is worth the extra price. For the slightly more capacity still able to keep the same form factor, I find it better than the big Seidio 3500 mAH which is around the same price and doesn't have a wall charger. I wish I searched and found this earlier!!!Pros:Very good price. It's equivalent to each piece of the package being $13.33 which isn't bad at all.More battery life compared to the stock.If you decide to still keep the stock you have 3 batteries to rotate with.I would rather wait for my phone to boot (about 3 minutes) than a dead battery to fully charge (2.5-3 hours) or get a partial charge.Cons:As others have mentioned the charge takes a very long time. It took me 7 hours for a completely dead 1800 mAH battery. I highly recommend plugging it in before you sleep. Sometime 7 hours before you wake up should be good.",5
"My concern with the purchase of the Evo 4g was battery life. Not anymore. First of all, You get two batteries for the price of one and a wall charger! Too cool. To top that off, the batteries are 1800 Amh and they out work the original HTC battery. Totally Recommend this product. Shipped immediately and received promptly. Thank-you Amazon, Chichichi and fellow reviewers.",5
"I got a pair of these batteries for use in a HTC Evo and HTC Touch Pro 2 (both use the same battery).  These are the highest capacity batteries that will fit inside the standard slim battery cover without making the phone fatter with a larger battery.Both batteries have been working fine in both phones for over a year with no swelling.  I think the additional capacity over OEM is real but is only a small real-world increase.The included charger is very useful.  When my Touch Pro 2 runs the battery down completely, it can be a difficult dance of plugging, resetting, replugging, popping battery in and out before you can get it to charge inside the phone again.  With the external charger, you can just charge up the completely-drained battery and then put it back in the phone.  The LED indicator on the charger is super-bright, bright enough that it makes it hard to sleep in the same room with it.  I had to cover it up, but it might make a good night light if you want one.",4
"If you use the HTC Evo, you go through batteries like a hot knife through butter.  The advantage of the HTC over the iPhone, among other things is the ability to swap out a battery at will instead of waiting for the damn thing to recharge.  For this, you need multiple batteries and chargers.First the one you get is 1350 mAh.  Think if this number as a way to determine how long it will last.  These don't get you far.You can pick up some 1500 mAh batts on this site- they suck on many levels.  They somehow last less than the OEM; they never fit right so the back of the phone won't go on right; and they start to fall apart (yes- they fall apart).You can go buy the Seido 1750 mAh (or is it 1700?).  They're OK.  I had two of them.  But they were $40 a piece and for what?  They last a little longer than the OEM and they don't fall apart.Then there's the 3500 mAh but that thing is huge and you need a special back to fit on because it is essentially two no-frills batts stuck together.  No way.Last, theres these guys.  Pick o' the litter.  They fit just like the OEM, they come with a charger.  They are well built and do not start to fall apart at the third change.  They're CHEAP!! And they seemingly last forever.  The jump from 1700 mAh to 1900 mAh makes all the difference.  I am constantly checking my phone to see if it's time to change the battery and the damn thing hasn't even gone gold yet, never mind red!  Best by far.My only complaint is that if I'd known how long they lasted, I might not have bought four of them!",5
"I've now had this 'kit' for a few months and think it's a fantastic bargain now. I believe it was about $100 when it came to market. I am a power user and really needed more battery power and I'm just not happy with carrying around external chargers like poor iPhone power users almost always need to use. Having the extra two batteries just about gets me through the day. I still supplement the charges while in the car. Also, the batteries conveniently fit together in that smaller pocket in a pocket most jeans have. To this day, I don't know what is supposed to go in there!My issues are really just minor annoyances. First off, the batteries are not the same form factor as the original. They got more power out of it by bulking it up, ever so slightly. I mean, yes, it fits in the same place, but it's a very tight squeeze and its quite a challenge to get them out of the phone. I have to hit the phone against my other hand to help it out. Good thing my Evo can take the abuse. Sometimes I do manage with my fingernails. The original battery comes right out.My second issue, which has been addressed here, is the charger really does take a long time to charge. One of the advantages to having an extra charger is to be able to charge one battery while using another, OR charge two batteries at once. Charging via the phone is simply much much faster and I found myself swapping out the batteries so the phone would do most of the charging. Personally, I would have paid $10 more for a more powerful charger that equaled the charge power of the phone.TIP: If you do a lot of battery swapping, you can purchase a simple silicone case/cover for your EVO (possibly for your other phones without slide out keyboards) and you wont need the standard back over the battery which is a hassle to remove and put back on. The silicone case holds the battery in place and protects the phone as well. When it comes time to swap a battery, it is simple and fast.In the end, I ended up purchasing the 3500 mAh battery from Innocell which really lasts a long LONG time. More than twice as long as the standard batteries. I don't mind the extended case and size, but the great thing is, if that ever runs out, and it happens, I can sandwich these two batteries in the case as my backup. one in use, the other a spare riding piggyback and always ready to be swapped.Of course most of you are not power users like I am, but if you are, consider this a great bargain",4
"Was nervous about the purchase because I seen HTC as the brand in the picture but didn't know if I was actually going to be sent HTC batteries.. Well they were 1900mah and HTC brand. Wall charger is slow to charge but you can plug your phone in at the same time. I am cord less and carry just an extra battery and man does it feel good to not worry about that cord, or plugging in. Good value and great price.",5
"3 stars as it is OK... so far as this 1800 MAh is no better than the OEM 1500 MAh for my usage.  Taking the average over the week I haven't seen any difference between these batteries and the OEM... they all are in need of charging by 3 pm after unplugging at 7:00 am.  I work in the same building M - F so they all get a similar amount of cellular coverage and I do similar tasks on the device each day.I didn't have to charge them up for more than 1 hour upon arrival before the charger gave me the blue light (full charge).  At 3 pm (when I see the battery icon showing yellow), however, if I pull out the battery and put it in the charger, I leave at 6:30ish and the battery isn't finished charging. This weekend I plugged one in at home which was around 10% remaining (red battery icon) and it took around 6 to 7 hours to full charge... whereas when I charged one of the 1800 MHa in the phone it took around 2 hours.Overall they are OK as they at least last as long as the OEM and it is great to have 2 extras... it is nice not having to worry about having to find a charger, I just put the spare in my pocket on the weekend or in my bag M -F... my only concern is that I will either break or wear out the back cover pulling it off so much OR forget the battery in my pocket and run it through the wash!! ;)I would recommend this product as it is, it does work, it just doesn't give me any more time than the OEM even though it should hold more juice.... I will update after a another week of charging cycles to let you know if that helps.  1 battery would have 4 full cycles and the other 3 full cycles so far... I read other reviewers say somewhere around 6 cycles to get start seeing an improvement.  We shall see.",3
"I bought a set of these batteries for my HTC EVO and before I wrote this review I used them in my phone for several weeks keeping track of my usage and battery life.My daily usage on average includes:7 minutes of non-roaming phone calls.26 text messages.5 hours of streaming music via Pandora.2 8MP photographs2 hours of internet browsing.3 YouTube (or similar) videos.20 minutes of gaming (City Jumper, Alchemy, Wings of Steel, etc)I have 3 email accounts that sync once per hour as well as the HTC Weather App and nothing else syncs.Over 14 days with the stock 1500mAh HTC battery that came with the phone, I got 19 hours of average battery life.Over the next 14 days with the first ChiChiTec 1800mAh battery I got an average of 22 hours of battery life.Over the next 14 days with the second ChiChiTec 1800mAh battery I got an average of 24 hours of battery life.So in general the 1800mAh batteries get a couple more hours of battery life than the original HTC battery which keeps in line with their slightly higher mAh rating. I don't have access to a battery tester so I cannot confirm that the batteries are actually 1800mAh but the testing I have does seems to be in line with this rating.You can get two of these batteries for the price of a single HTC battery from Sprint and they work just as well as the stock battery. They charge either in the included charger or through the phone via the HTC (or similar) charger. The only negative I have for these batteries and charger, is that plugging a micro USB cable into the bottom of the charger in order to charge my phone and a spare battery from a single outlet causes my phone to freeze repeatably. Apparently the USB outlet on the battery charger I got was defective, but not a problem worth returning the batteries over. For the price you pay, you get two high quality third party batteries and a charger which is a pretty good bargain all things considered.",4
"Still use these, 2 years after purchasing them.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Work just like the stock batteries and the charger it comes with is great.",5
"Bought these to replace the OEM battery on my EVO.Performs a whole lot better.I've had these batteries for almost 2 years and they still hold a great chargeLasts me 12 hours of regular useSometimes over a full day (24hrs+) if not used at allNow, maybe the ones I got were just awesome.Take your chance. $24 bucks for 2 batteries ain't bad at all",5
Can't beat 2 additional batteries with a wall charger for less than $50. Was just what I needed to make it through the work day (on 1 battery). The larger capacity had a noticeable impact on battery life (+2 hrs at least),4
"i've had these for two years and they are still working fine. Good thing to, because my first evo battery didn't want to charge anymore. Luckily I had two more. You do notice a better battery life with these compared to the factory battery, but only if you leave the 4g and gps off. If you keep either of those on, it doesn't make a difference, my battery drains pretty quick with moderate use.",4
very handy however I don't use it anymore since I have a new phone. very very good batteries. I miss that phone just thinking about it,5
"These batteries used to be a bargain. Not a true 1800 mah battery, but seem to last a little longer than the OEM battery...  They also used to sell for $34.99 here on Amazon and on ebay (same seller) for 2 batteries and a charger.  Now they are $100 here and $60 on ebay, and no longer a bargain, or even worth it for the marginal increase over the OEM battery.  I was planning to buy a couple more, but when I saw the price increase I bought a couple red OEM batteries on ebay for $28, and three chargers for $9...a much better deal.Update:I've raised my rating to 5 stars because the price is back under $40.  I can definitely recommend these batteries, but not at $60-100.",5
"These batteries are fine but i found these other batteries that are the same but WAY cheaper2X Battery + Travel Wall Charger for Sprint HTC Evo 4G, HTC Hero, Imagio, Ozone, Snap, Tilt 2, Verizon Droid Touch Pro 2",3
"as posted by another reviewer, this same set cost 34 bucks just a few weeks ago.  they work fine, about the same as the stock battery in my experience.",4
These are a great pair of replacement batteries for the price.  I would not necessarily agree with the other reviews as far as capacity goes.  It seems like they have the same capacity as the factory battery.  Still a good buy though.,4
"Got for Droid Incredible, first off the back cover will not attach fully. 1mm gap all the way around, it stays on and will be covered by cover/gloves. The temperature function is not present, says 77F all the time. For me testing kernels and overclocking this is a must to report issues with kernel. Not knowing what your temperature is can cause battery and phone failure. Battery improvement was about 2 hours more than stock 1300mAh. I returned and bought Seidio 1750mAh which leaves this one in the dust. Seidio on standby use 9 hours with 75% battery left.",1
"Good product. A little tight in my Incredible 2, but they fit. Some people say it leaves a gap between the battery cover and the phone, but not mine. If you use a case you wouldn't notice one anyway, and I ALWAYS have a case on my phone.Better battery life and CHEAP. Nice.",5
"I bought these batteries about 4 months ago and they have been awesome. I also purchased a thicker 3500mAh extended battery for $50, but I hate how thick it made my Evo. Two of these for just $28 is a great deal. One charge will last most of the day, and simply pop in another one if one battery runs out. The wall charger is slow, but it works great overnight. You can charge your phone with a battery in it and an extra battery with the wall charger at the same time. This is a must have for EVO 4G users.",5
"I received the product shortly after my order was placed, upon opening the packaging one thing was clear the headphones are made of very cheap plastic. The build quality would not be such a big issue if the sound quality was any good, sadly the sound quality is less than spectacular. For the price and quick delivery it's not such a waste of money, however I would advise future customers not to purchase this product unless they only have a few bucks to waste.",2
These headphones I loved using so did everyone else around me. I lost these headphones that is why I got the red ones. I love red,5
"These ear plugs need to be evaluated compare to other under $10 buds. Compared to higher priced items they are of very low quality and low durability. But if you think of them as a disposable item they are OK. I bought 2 sets, one arrived defective and I tossed it out. The other is still working after 2 weeks",2
"I ordered this set in hopes that I could use it as a headset for my dumbphone. I hadn't had my luck in the past with headphones and I didn't give this much of a chance based on the price. But I was wrong! They worked perfectly! I can easily make calls using the &#34;on/off&#34; switch and the mic picks up well on my calls. Also, the earbuds are soft enough that they don't bother me if they are in my ear for a long period of time. I recently wore an earbud for a 5 hour car trip without even realizing it! You can't beat this product for the price.",5
only thing that i don't like about this  is it's hard to keep them in my ear.but the sound is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
they fell apart after a couple of weeks but they were just cheap replacement anyways. but for the time the worked fine,3
I was very surprised at how comfortable these earpieces are when placed in my ears. They are very soft and easy to wear for long periods of time.,5
"These earbuds don't sound like 200 dollar earbuds, but they're not. They're very inexpensive and nice to use when you need a set of earbuds. You can use the limited controls and calling is supported so you can talk with them.",5
these phones work very well and are more durable than the add stated. i will share this with others i know as well as purchase them as a gift. i really liked these earbuds and the price was rite also.,5
At first I loved it since it helped protect my phone and made for an easy grip. After about three drops the clips that helps hold it on the phone broke and it became useless.,2
"The phone no longer stays in the case after only about five weeks of use.  This can be really be dangerous for the phone if you use the case in it's belt-clip mode.  This case is fine if you never plan on taking the phone out of it.  Otherwise, DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!",1
"I purchased my Body Glove case for the droid 2 about a week ago and here is what I think is the good and bad...The good:The grip is good.  I have not dropped the phone since I got the case.  The droid 2 is sleek and slippery in my opinion and I dropped it quite a few times since owning it.  Every time I dropped it, the back flew off and the battery flew across the room.You can set the phone down on the face or the back without the phone touching the surface.  I was always careful about putting the phone on the back because I didn't want to scratch the camera lens on the back.  Now that is not a issueIt did survive a fall.  Although I have not dropped the phone, my daughter did.  The case stayed intact and the was no batter shooting across the floor.The look.  I actually like how it looks.Cost. It was only $8.50 with free shipping on Amazon.The Bad:It adds bulk to the phone so it feels a little heavier to me.It is harder to slid in and out of my pocket.  The grip that has saved me from dropping the phone causes it to be more difficult to fish in and out of my pocket.It seems a little more difficult to slid open to access the keyboard.  Not a big deal, just a little bit more effort is required.The top row of buttons are a little harder to access.  I have small thumbs so its not to bad for me but if you have large thumbs this could be a problem.The number one bad thing for me is that I can't dock the phone.  I bought the R2D2 version and it came with a docking station which I used nightly.  I thought this may be an issue when buying the case so shame on me.  If you really need a clock at night, like i do, i suggest getting Kaloer Clock on the android market.  It's free.  So I have to plug in the phone for charging and prop it up.I don't use the belt click and no intention of doing so since it makes your phone face outward which, in my opinion, is going to get your screen cracked.At this point I'm not sure if I'm going to continue to use it but I'll probably give it a month before I make my final decision.I hope this helps.",3
had to super glue the front on.. would not go on no matter how i tried to get it to fit. the bottom went on great.. but the top .. no,2
"the  case was on time and fits very well to my phone. the same case was 23.00 in the store the other day when i just happen to see it,",5
"This is supposed to be basically indestructible. It actually got a couple small scratches when I was applying it.  It doesn't seem to scratch now though.  The scratches may be on the back side.  Also, if your hands are hot or sweaty, it will be very difficult to slide your fingers across the screen.  They kind of stick.  I get around this by wrapping my shirt around my finger.  The protector also causes kind of a weird glare.  It looks like the screen is rough and not smooth.  Despite these issues, I am still very happy with it.  It is doing its job.",4
"Don't believe the hype from this company about how your screen sensitivity is not impacted. I went to the mall and spent my 25 bucks to have them put it on my Captivate for me so that I'd have a beautiful bubble free end result. It looked good but the euphoria only lasted about hour.This is no exaggeration. It totally ruined the screen response. Both the home and back buttons at the bottom of the screen required multiple hard presses and I could no longer text accurately using my Swype. While dragging from letter to another I'd get 'skips' which garbled the input. This was no better that the one dollar product I had purchased from ebay a week earlier. But it was far more aggravating given that cost was many times higher and I actually drive to the mall to have them put it on.My theory was complete proven when I peeled off this $25 waste and my screen sensitive was back to normal. The marketing machine for ZAGG makes a big deal about the strength and scratch resistance of this product. When asked, their reps are trained to tell you it does not affect screen sensitivity. If decide you take their word for it, just be sure you ask if you can get a refund if you are not satisfied with how their product handles that one aspect of functionality. As it stands, they only replace it if it get scratched.Otherwise, don't get near these people.",1
"Got this for my grandma and her new phone, and it works really well. I've had this on my older phones as well, and it sure is durable. I've tried scratching it with keys, and coins with no problem at all. Held up really well and durable. It does run on the sticky side, so if you plan on using certain styli with it, it might not run as smooth.",5
"At first I thought this product just included the front screen protector(SP) so I was surprised to find teh full-body protection.  I don't understand why people complain about the installation.  Just watch a couple Youtube videos on how to install and you're good.  I've installed these on four devices now with no issue's.  A iPhone 4s is my primary.  This one I did have to remove it once I had pressed the solution out but it was my mistake.  Zagg allows 3-5 minutes for removal and re-install but I don't recommend it.  Sometimes the removal stretches the screen protector.  My mistake during install was not holding down the opposite side which i'm pressing so the SP doesnt move.  Also, I found using a lot of the solution allows for easy install.  Don't be stingy with the solution cause in the end, it's only one SP per package(unless noted) so use a lot.  Just keep a terry cloth handy to wipe the excess water from the sides(not on the screen prior to install as it will leave particles) and press to the sides.",5
It's mediocre. It turns yellow after a while and MIGHT leave some sticky residue on your phone. It's great for protection though.,3
"Don't expect these tools to last through the replacement... or certainly not last for a second repair.  The 2 green handled tools barely made it through the first attempt to pry the glass from the case.The guitar pick looking thing was okay... and never needed the suction cup since the screen was shattered... but I'm sure it would have done fine.But really, the product is the battery and it has performed well after the replacement.  Candidly, the original battery was fine -- but 3 years old and a broken screen, figured I might as well replace the battery with the screen.  Since the battery came with tools it was a bonus... turns out the screen also came with tools --- and thankfully I had 2 sets.  Because the pry thingies break easy and I needed BOTH sets.",4
"Apple may no longer support the 3Gs but my stubborn mother likes it and wont part ways with it. After so many years battery was dying, this new one resurrected the device. Not easy to install if you are not a true major hardware geek, but this contains every single item you would need for a replacement if you are not afraid to poke inside the device.",5
Received my order on the day promised. The accessories included in the kit worked very well. With the help of this kit I was easily able to fix my old iPhone.,5
"I guess it's the wrong battery, the part numbers are different from the original battery.  It repeatedly crashes BOTH 3gs phones I put it in - he 16 gig and the 32 gig.  Will be returning and getting my $14 back.",1
"I run my 3Gs with the brightness up, bluetooth on, and 3G running with it tethered to my laptop. and this replacement wasn't worth it.",3
"Best case I ever bought for my white iphone 4 its lasted so.long and I still love it awsome product would recommend for anyone to buy, super durable dtopped my phone several times no problems.",5
"The color of this bumper is exactly what I was looking for--it's a very bold pink. There are a few issues though. It is hard to press the sleep button. You have to press down really really hard in order for the real iPhone sleep button to be pressed through the plastic/rubber or whatever the case is made of. The opening where you plug the charger/USB cable is kind of off. The case gets in the way of the cable being plugged into the phone all the way unless you push it in really really hard, and then you have to set it down gently and not touch it while it's charging or it can come loose. These problems were such a bother that I stopped using this case for a very long time.I recently had the idea to make some adjustments--I used a box-cutter to cut the opening wider for the charger. I also cut slits along the straight sides of the sleep button so that it will depress more easily when I press it. That has really helped. Now I have no issues. But if you don't like to make custom adjustments to your stuff, be aware that these problems do exist.",3
I ordered this because it said protective when I got the bumper its nothing but a lil piece of plastic I'm sure that it cannot protect anything. It should have costed 69 cents because thats how crappy it was.,1
"I bought several different bumpers and I wanted a hot pink one. I received it quickly and was happy with it except that it turned gray when it as in my pocket. I tried to wash it off with soap and water but it didn't work. I had this happen to another light colored one also. Good thing they were cheap because this is the 2nd one I've had to throw away. I'll end up getting more bumpers because I like the way they look on my white IPHONE 4 but I will just not expect to have them very long.Fosmon Apple iPhone 4 / iPhone 4G TPU Protective Bumper Case, Hot Pink",3
This is a nice case but i thought there was a clear piece to cover the back but i was wrong. it is just the pink outline of the phone so it's not very protective. it doesn't snug the phone like it should either. Its a tiny bit loose.,3
"I purchased this bumper for my mom b/c she has the white iPhone and I have the black. Pink look good on white point blank. This bumper is fantastic, went on tightly, it wasn't loose fitting and the protectors didn't lift up. All the ports was accessible volume, headphone jack & charging port. Well worth the dollar I paid for this.",5
This case is great for the price and decently protective. I bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it! They are very slim and easy to get in and out of your pocket unlike rubberized bumpers! 5 stars!,5
Person I bought this for hates it.,1
"fast ,reliable,great,good, thanks again. love this love this i love this love love this so so so so so much",5
This is a great option for a case without having to shell out the extra money for a name brand case..it protects my case with the plastic inner piece and the rubber outer piece.  I use different colors to separate all the phones in the family.,5
This is awesome. I have never had a otterbox but I would have to say that this case protects my iphone really really well.Would recommend this for anyone with an iphone 4!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Got my first Iphone - so needed a case. Friend gave me an Otterbox skin that he got in the mail (without having an Iphone) - but I wanted my favorite color.  This is just as good. Maybe not quite as 'smooth' in fit - but contrary to some reviews...I dropped this phone running on my horse (as in horsebackriding) and it protected my phone just fine. $5.00 vs $25+....this is a no brainer!,4
I usually prefer the name brand Otter Box but this is a good alternative and great for the price! Would recommend to anyone that wants a heavy duty phone case at a great price!,3
"arrived two days early, the hard plastic shell was a little difficult to install, once installed i noticed the volume would go down by itself so i removed the case which the hard plastic case was rather difficult to remove ,once removed found the problem was the holes for the up and down volume buttons were not made correctly causeing the case to push the volume button down when installed , with a pair of wire cutters and a quick trim job solved the problem  and the outer purple soft rubber covered up the jagged cut job ...so i gave 4 stars instead of 5 for this reason, but the case is very attractive and people ask where did you get a purple otter box? i do like it and ordered another one for my nephew",4
I am very disappointed in this product. the info given on this case is very deceiving! this product is supposed to be like an Otter Box DEFENDER SERIES AND THAT IS SO FAR FROM TRUE!!! I WAS SO VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT I WILL ORDER ANYTHING ELSE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3
"Works great.Con - Battery runs dead overnightOtherwise, it pairs up nice and has good range.Do not buy if your looking for serious audiophile sound quality, but is good enough for the average Joe or talk radio.",4
El Producto si llego a tiempo el empaque muy  lindo el manos libres esta malo de fabrica aunque el vendedor es muy legal y me hizo la devolucion  del dinero eso me alienta a seguir comprando por aca en amazon porque son muy responsables los felicito . Gracias,5
Great little Bluetooth headset that's even better when combined with the ear buds that connect to the bluetooth head set. They are great for going: running with.,5
WALMART AND BESTBUY WAS SELLING SIMILAR ITEM FOR DOUBLE THE PRICE. FELL IN LOVE WITH THE FACT THAT I CAN HAVE BLUETOOTHED WITH MY CAR RADIO AND CELL PHONE AT SAME TIME.WOULD HAVE GIVEN A FIVE STAR IF BETTER EAR BUDS WAS WITH THE CONTOURS TO THE EAR.BLUETOOTH ACTUALLY DOES NOT SIT IN EAR LIKE SUPPOSE TO KEEPS FALLING OUT NOW I HAVE TO FIND A EARBUD TO FIT AND MAKE COMFORTABLE. ON THE UPSIDE TEH STERO HEADPHONES FITS LOVELY.,3
"Recieved order on schedule and was impressed with quality got these to replace a lost Samsung HM3700 earpiece, the sound quality is much better. would be 5 star but the blutooth does not work well with calling contacts and google now, would figure that a headset that is made by samsung would work well with Samsung phone (galaxy note 2)",4
"This is one of those items that it kills you not to like it but yet it has it's quirks that just annoy you.  In the functioning of this headset it is absolutely perfect.  The battery life is great as well as the range and the audio quality using a decent set of headphones is great but there are some serious design annoyances.  The biggest annoyance to me is that I purchased this item to use it as a bluetooth transport to listen to music from my MacBook but the mono earbud attached to the device is not removable so, despite it having a clip for your shirt/belt, it needs to be carried in your pocket because the earbud extends past the clip.  Additionally it does not have a built in 3.5 headphone jack so you have to use an adaptor to plug into the micro USB port which wouldn't be half as bad if the adaptor wasn't half the size of the device it's self.In short, the performance of this is absolutely great but it has some very annoying usability issues that keep this from being the perfect device.",3
"These have nice sound reproduction.  Are convenient due to bluetooth.  Easy to use and set up.  However I was expecting active noise cancellation from the earbuds and this isn't the case (silly me...).  Also, when using the earbuds during a phone call you can't hear yourself speak very well.  It sounds strange but the other party has no trouble hearing you.I probably wouldn't have purchased these had I understood this.",3
"Comfort , light, good music quality sound work really good on those adapter from your phone to any stereo system with 3.5mm , but noise canceling is really bad , every  one complain , i can not hear you or a lot of background noise when you drive",3
"Well I actually liked this product while I owned it. My problem was that it stopped charging after a few weeks,  but as usual Amazon was great with returns. I wasn't a big fan of the permanently attached earbuds that would make it awkward to attach it to a shirt pocket or collar. The call quality was good enough that I didn't find myself constantly repeating what I had to say. Callers on the other line could hear what I was saying clearly. Noise cancellation seemed to be good as well. Battery life was decent,  I could use this gizmo for the better part of a day without recharging it. Had it not stopped charging I would probably still be using it today,  and of course it would be worth 5 stars.",3
"It does exactly what it says it does. Just one thing...If you like to position your iPod or iPhone so that the button is on the right hand side, the iCarpus, when used as pictured, covers the volume buttons. You can otherwise just flip the iPod/iPhone over. I bought the white one for myself & the other colors as gifts.",5
"Received the stand today and tried it on a ipod and Samsung Exhibit II. It works on both very well. The material is smooth and not very hard so it won't scratch your phone. When you place your phone vertically, if the end of the phone is not purely flat, the phone tends to wiggle when you slightly touch it.I agree with some people, it a nice piece of plastic, however it's overpriced. And I'll see how long it can last.",4
"When I first saw this, I thought it was a great idea for a product.  It is very portable and easy to use.  Works well only if you have a truly 'square' corner phone especially in the upright position. If you have any 'rounded' phone corners, it will roll over to the 'landscape' position.  Also, if you charging port is at the bottom of the phone, you will have to prop it up in the 'landscape' position too.  Great for traveling but not everyday use.",3
"This little thing is a beast, it hold my nexus and my gs3, i really don;t know why people think its going to hurt your screen. The metal band is small, and most of it is plastic. You can use it with a case too!",5
"Perfect for the road warrior, because its very light and takes very little space when closed.  Very well designed and executed.Holds the phone with a firm, positive grasp, allowing you to use the touchscreen without tipping it over or dislodging it.  Not at all precarious.  Supports the phone well in portrait or landscape orientation.  You only get one viewing angle in landscape, but in portrait you can slide the stand up or down and get a range of angles.Sturdy enough for the purpose.  Made of sturdy plastic with a metal spring, its not indestructible.  I wouldn't expect it to survive being stepped on.  On the other hand, its at least as sturdy as my unprotected Motorola Droid 2.I like the fact that I could put a case on the phone and still use the iCarpus stand.Great value for the price.",5
"An ingenious little device for holding your smartphone up, so you can watch it or use it without needing to use both hands.  The device works perfectly in the landscape orientation, but it doesn't work very well in the portrait orientation, at least not with my G2X.  At this price, it is still a worthwhile investment, but buyers should be aware of the limitation.",4
"I'm very impressed with this stand.  It folds up nicely so it's easy to carry around with you.  It holds the iPod in 2 different positions and allows you to sit your iPod in a bunch of different ways.  I'm able to use a slim case on the iPod along with this stand which is great.The only problems so far is that it doesn't quite work with my wife's iPhone (4G) which is also protected with a slim case.  The grip handles are curved just right for an iPod but not for something thicker like the iPhone.The spring is what gives it its grip.  I would say that they've designed it at just the right level.  It's not hard to open but grips pretty well.  However, not well enough that the iPod won't slide out (i.e. if you have it clamped on its side and just held the whole thing by the stand).  And I think overtime, the spring will loose its tension.The plastic is a little soft.  I don't think it'll break/slap.  One of the grips has 2 handles.  If you use that side where the home button is, you can still plug in the USB connector -- smart (of course, you can also just grip the iPod on the other sides).4 out of 5 because it doesn't work well with iPhone.UPDATE: After using on/off for about 10 months, it broke.  There's a weak spot on the arms (the 2 prong side) close to where the spring is.  If it gets twisted too many times, it breaks.  The arm hasn't completely come off and the stand actually could still work.  But now it doesn't grip as well.  Also, the rubber lining tends to come off (snaps back pretty easy).  Downgraded to 3.",3
"Simple well built stand. I use it with my Galaxy Nexus. It only fits one way due to the size of the phone. But it does work great. Holds it perfectly in landscape, can be used in portrait as well, but it's a little wobbly due to the rounded bottom of the phone.",4
"When I first opened up this device to try it out, it 'overstretched' and I couldn't get it back into position to actually grip my phone!  I actually had to get a pair of pliers and twist the wires on the spring to get the single tab back into place to grip.  It still doesn't fold all the way flat when it's not in use, but close enough.  Because of this, I'm giving this product just 3 stars.  It's small and handy to take on the go, but I would have liked something a little more durable.",3
"this is a solid universal phone stand. i was a little surprised at how strong the spring tension was when first opening it -- seems like a misplacement of the arms could catapult my phone a few feet. the only other thing i have to say about it is it's not quite a snug fit for an iPhone 4 with a semi-protective case (incipio NGP). if i had used my slim cygnett case with it i bet it would have fit better (though i should say, even with the NGP case, i didn't get the sense that my phone was going anywhere. i just mean that the indents on the arms seem to be made for something sightly smaller.)all in all though, i mark high for affordability and ease of use, and the fact that you don't have to buy this stand bundled with a case!",4
"It works well, but the quality is below average. Myself and a co-worker each have one and the plastic has broken near the hinge on both of these.",2
Allows me to enjoy the audio of my Samsung III without blocking the sound. Excellent for watching video or reading articles.,5
"I looked for something to hold my iPod touch and iphone 4 while I watch videos. This was just the perfect thing. It just clamps with spring tension in landscape or portrait position  very well. Best stand I have bought yet!iCarpus Stand for iPhone, iPod, and More - Mount - Retail Packaging - GraphiteIts very flat so it travels well.",5
"This is a great stand to have. It's small, easy to use, and holds my phone at just the right angle for watching videos, etc.",5
"The iCarpus folds flat for travel and firmly supports the Samsung Note on a table. It is the best stand for that phone that I have tried.  It is made out of plastic so I am not sure about durability. Considering the materials, it certainly could sell for less.",5
"I have tried several different stands for my iPhone, including both separate and built-in stands. Whats nicest about the iCarpus stand is how slim it is when not in use. It slips in a pocket, and can handle the phone with or without a case on. I take it everywhere and I love it!",5
"This is a really great lightweight stand. The construction and materials are very good throughout, and the design is excellent.",5
"This is a nice stand for your phone to view in horizontal position with a charging card attached. It is also adjustable for the vertical position,but can not charge the phone while watching in this position,but I always use the horizontal position anyway. It is very easy for your pocket or purse to carry with you if desired.I recommend it.",5
fits in my shirt pocket. works great with my leather cover. the price and product fair. I love it would buy another,5
"My Droid X has several 'homes'- entertainment center, desk @ work, desk @ home and bedside table. I've been looking for quite some time to find a portable, stable stand that would work both in portrait and landscape positions without toppling over or requiring a balancing act to keep it steady. This is it!The clip is secure and does not need to be adjusted when going from vertical to horizontal. Some apps do not suppurt full 180 screen rotation, so plugging in the charger or HDMI cable will essentially leave your phone 'upside down' at times.The grip is good enough to keep the phone from sliding, even when pressing hardkeys and such.Admittedly, it was annoying to unclip the phone to answer calls (without using speakerphone), so I just got used to the clip while on the phone- which wasn't hard!The prongs are perfectly spaced to avoid all buttons and ports, and do not block the screen.And, thanks to the X's unique profile, the clip slips neatly into my horizontal leather case.The iCarpus is by far the best stand that I've used with my Droid X. Plus, it's way better than buying extra multimedia docks!",5
I used this products for a few weeks and I was so happy. But the material was started breaking apart. First the glue part between the body and rubber were apart. Then the body part became broken into many pieces.,4
"It's a couple of pieces of carefully sized and curve plastic with a hinge that's really easy to squeeze, just like a clothespin.You pinch, and the jaws arc apart, and you slip your iPod right into the grip.  It stays firm.You can set the iPod on end or on the side on a table or whatever at the right distance to read and have your hands free.To put the iPod in your pocket, just pinch and flatten the gripper and slide it into your pocket - it's very light and very flat.  Surprisingly small.  It's also nicely packaged when it arrives.The gripper can pinch wide enough to go around a case you have on the iPod, so it's very convenient.  It probably fits many of these palm sized mobile devices.  The gripper edge looks to me like it would fit even the thicker phones, but still fits the slender iPod Touch very securely.If you order this from Amazon with enough other super-saver eligible items, it'll probably ship free - it did last week.Jacqueline Lichtenberg",5
"this is amazing...very convenient, i could bring this everywhere with me. Arrived in brand new box and reasonable price. Very light too.",5
"I've always cases with kickstands built in to them.  However, after I couldn't go more than 6 months in one of those cases without the stand breaking due to poor quality build, I decided to go with a regular non-kickstand case.  (I recommend the Spigen SGP10203 Slim Armor Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 by the way.)  So what was I to do with my &#34;I need my phone to stand upright&#34; needs?! The iCarpus Stand to the rescue.  It's an extremely simple yet effective design. Very sturdy spring loaded joint allows the arms to hug the phone tight. Depending on your phone, you can adjust the location of the stand on the phone to match the center-of-gravity and to avoid buttons.  I use this thing every day for weeks, and I've never had an issue.  Love it. Get it!",5
The stand is great for a slim device. I use it with my iPod (it has a slim tpu case on it). Works with my bulky Android phone without the case-with the case it slips out,4
"Sometimes you find something so ingeniously simple, it's surprising how much you like it.  This is a great little holder for my Droid Incredible.  It works equally well in both landscape and portrait.  It is stable and solid and stays in place as I navigate the screen or click buttons. It's light and small enough to toss in my purse and inexpensive enough to buy as stocking stuffers for the holidays for other smartphone toting members of the family.",5
"There are a whole bunch of better stands, which are more stylish, sturdier, etc.But for traveling, this one is king.I travel a lot so form factor is the biggest priority for me.When folded in its natural form, you can stow it anywhere - in your backpad, purse, luggage, messenger bag, etc.It is super slim and you will hardly ever notice it.When opened, it works well, and that's all you can really ask for.A tip is when you use it in landscape mode, you can slide it past its intended position for a better viewing angle.For example, in coach class, the tray table is usually pretty close to you when your chair is in its upright position.In its natural landscape orientation, you would not be able to view your iPhone/iPod properly. So just slide in a little more down and viola!Practical, functional, and inexpensive, it's the trifecta - recommended!",5
"I purchased this because my iPhone 5 case does not have a kickstand.  It feels sturdy and when not in use folds down to a small size.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it needs bigger lips to hold a phone with a case.  With just my iPhone it works great, but when the iPhone is in a case, it does not fit as well.  It still works, but I would feel better about it if the lips were bigger so it could hold onto the phone better.",4
"For a $11-12 product I expected alot more than this. The design and concept are fine, however the plastic feels thin and fragile and the rubber trim started to come off in less than a month.Returned the product to Amazon.Edit: after trying the iZel stand that costs twice as much I may end up getting this stand again. The iCarpus is much easier to use and adjust. I just wish the stand was not so flimsy and made of tougher material.",3
The icarpus is the perfect stand for your device. It holds my iPhone in both horizontal and vertical positions.  I even used it with the single stand on top of my iPhone and the dual stand on the bottom so the charging area is open.  This way I can use icarpus while charging my phone.I stays flat for storing until you spread both sections with the spring.  I have been using the icarpus every day and still working perfectly.  Great idea. You won't be sorry if you ordered one for yourself.,5
"Sturdy, cheap and they can't 'separate' it easily from the base. In a restaurant I set it up when he's really getting fidgity and at least it buys us twenty minutes to finish up and pay the bill!",5
"Was using this as a stand for when i do facetime on my phone. It broke when I bent it back too far, only 1/2 an inch or so. It uses a small spring to keep the clamp shut. The spring is really weak. If you bend it back to far, i t will not work anymore.",2
I got this for my driod X.. Love it for watching movies.  My wife has one for her phone. She also uses is for her I~touch,5
"I'm using this for my Droid X, although I suspect it would work well with any smartphone. This little contraption is so portable that I can just toss it in the back pocket of my jeans. Amazing that something so small can be so very helpful. I'd give it 10 stars if I could-- and that includes shipment/delivery. Excellent transaction, start to finish.[FYI: My Amazon Vine membership played no role in this transaction. I paid out of pocket, and am extremely pleased with the entire transaction.)",5
"Cons:Placement of grips blocks screen and volume buttons of Samsung Captivate.Does not hold the phone up vertically well.  Very prone to tipping over in this positionMy phone has a silicone cover/sleeve, and the rubber on rubber sometimes slips offPros:It looks goodFits easily in my backpack to bring with me whereverEDIT:The rubber/grey trim literally fell off, just peeled right off.  And the plastic even got cracked.  Overall, poorly constructed and very weak.NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL",1
"This is a great little stand for my iPhone 4.  Because if it's design, it can be used to fit any type of electronic device, with or without a case.  I have the Apple issued bumper case for my iPhone, and this stand works perfectly.The design also allows for portrait or landscape standing of the device.  Landscape is nice for watching movies, and also allows me to plug my power cable into the phone while still using it.  In addition, I can move the stand towards the top or bottom of my phone which changes the angle of viewing.For the price, this item can't be beat.  It's made of durable plastic, and has a rubber coating along all the points of contact to prevent scratching.  It's extremely light weight and portable, and when not used, it folds very flat.  A simple yet practical design.",5
This is the best phone stand I could find for the price. It works very well for all of my smart phones. The description is very accurate. Look no further then this one if you're in the market for a great phone stand. It's just awesome! Thanks,5
"This is a great little device.  It works as a very portable stand for my Galaxy Nexus Android smartphone and for the kids' iPod Touches.  I let my three-year-old borrow it and he wouldn't give it back to me for an hour.  The build quality seems really good, but don't overextend it; a coworker overextended it and now the spring will not hold it closed, although it is still functional as a phone stand.",5
"Want to prop your iPhone (in my case 3GS) up vertically or horizontally?  This is what you're looking for.  Even works with my iPhone still in it's protective case (moshi glaze).  Does exactly what you'd expect, and the little arms that hold it are NOT intrusive to the viewing area.Does what it says it does.  Great product.  Perfect.- Ron Donofero",5
"It looked good on paper....BUT it broke within one week. I definitely would NOT recommend. Once the spring breaks, it's garbage.",1
"I purchased this stand for my iphone to prop the phone up when watching movies etc.  For the price, gotta love it.  Item is made out of plastic, but very sturdy!I have a LifeProof/WaterProof iphone case which works fine with this product!",5
I bought 6 of these.  They are great to keep your cords rolled up and then use as a stand if needed.,5
This is a great cell phone or iPod stand for traveling. I have tried different types of stands but nothing is as convenient as this one. I also use this to store my ear bud cables. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a stand to support their iPod or Cell Phone.,5
I got this for when I travel I wanted to use my iPhone as an alarm clock. This clips on each side of my phone and props us the phone as advertised. Seems to be good quality. So far no complaints.,5
"I wanted a temporary, detachable stand and this works like a charm! Conveniently folds to reside in my pocket when not needed, clips onto my GS3 for easy video viewing.I recommend having at least a simple rubber/TPC case on the GS3, as centering the three contact points will not be possible otherwise; either the power or volume buttons would be impacted.Note: Does not work in portrait mode, due to resting on the hinge, which is rounded.",5
I was scared that this will not handle the width of my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 but was able to handle it but pushing its limits. But still great for the phone. Slim and nice!!.,5
"Works, but cheaply made from cheap plastic. I expected something a bit better. The angle is only good for a desk or something, I bought it to watch movies on a night stand and I wish angle was adjustable......oh well....",3
"This is fine for passive devices (LED lights, fans, random toys), but I don't trust it for sensitive electronics (phones, ipods, etc).  Even in the Off or Light position, power is still being sent to the USB port.  And when you switch to the Usb position, there is a short surge in power.  Maybe I got a faulty product, but it's so cheap that it's not worth the time/money to do an RMA.I looked for a product like this after I saw the DIY Altoids tin emergency USB charger product, but I'm guessing the electronics inside this unit aren't very high quality.",3
"I had boughten something similar to this charger but it did not work, so I decided to buy one of these. When it got to my house, I opened the package and I went to go get two double A batteries, when I put them in, the little flashlight worked, but when I put my usb charger to my iPod, it did not charge, then I tried other usb chargers with other phones, and it did not work, bad product, do not waste your money",1
"For less than four dollars, this is a pretty good gadget that can save the day in many situations. It has a 3-position power switch: LED flash light, Off, and USB. The white LED flash light isn't that bright, because it has only one LED, but it is usable if you need to find a keyhole in the dark. When in the USB mode, a red LED will light up to indicate that it is turned on.It takes two AA size batteries. Certainly you can use Alkaline batteries like Duracell and Energizer, but rechargeable batteries are more economical and earth friendly.'Normal' rechargeable battery are of the Ni-MH type, which is 1.2V in voltage.Now there is a new kind that is Ni-Zn, which produces a voltage of 1.6v - much closer to the voltage of Alkaline battery.The brand I use is called Powergenix; each AA battery is rated at 2500 mAh in capacity. A fast 1-hour charger plus 4 battery cost only $18.PowerGenix ZR-PGX1HRAA-4B 1 Hour Quick Charger with 4 AA 1.6v NiZn Rechargeable BatteriesIMO, this is the best type of battery to power this USB emergency charger, because the higher voltage makes it last much longer, and you can charge it over and over to save money.",5
"I thought it was charging my phone when I saw the battery icon change to the charging icon. Battery charge indicator went from 51% to 47% while still charging. The 'flashlight' was virtually useless, it was very dim, the red led indicator for the USB charger was twice brighter than the white led for the flashlight.- EDIT -Tried charging it with the phone off at 25% remaining charge. Not only does it not charge, it actually drained the battery.",1
"They call this an 'emergency' charger, but it has plenty of use everyday for busy people who use the many features of their smartphones.  My Droid-X battery is good for about 4-5 hours when I'm running flat-out (GPS, 4G, phone, lots of background apps running, max screen brightness).  This little gizmo keeps me going when I'm on the go and can't stop to 'plug in.'And no more worrying about my cell phone battery when I'm camping - just bring along some extra AAs.  I use Nimh rechargeable batteries, but in a real 'emergency' it's easy to find regular AA batteries just about anywhere.My only complaint is the flashlight.  I'm not sure what the intended purpose is of a flashlight is on a charger, but I know an unintended purpose - it can be easily activated when the device is in a pocket or backpack, draining down the battery (though slowly, as the flashlight is a rather weak LED).  The switch is not recessed or protected.  If I am stowing the device, I try to remember to take one of the batteries out.Outstanding value at this price.",5
"The unit I received from BestDealUSA was defective. The led came on but not anything would charge. I promptly contacted BestDealUSA and they promptly responded. I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it and as it turns out, they didn't either. I was refunded my money for the unit AND shipping. A+ for BestDealUSA once again.",4
"First off, this thing uses two AA batteries which is great because they are easy to find in almost any emergency situation where you would need this kind of device. However, two AA batteries will not provide enough juice to fully charge up any modern smart phone battery. I use this device from time to time with my Epic 4G Touch Galaxy S2 phone and by completely draining two AA batteries my phone gets back about 40% of its battery recharged. This is more than enough charge to call your family to come pick you up, or call the auto service because your car's battery died and you can't get it started (or charge your phone).As a battery 'extender' this little device can add about 3 hours of video playback, or 8 hours of audio playback depending on your device. Two AA batteries will ALMOST fully charge an iPod classic, and since this device just has a standard USB outlet any device that charges with some form of USB cable should work fine.One downside is that if you try to charge a smart phone while it is turned on, it will not charge the phone very much. The phone will just draw current form the battery pack and drain it dry. Also when this charger is being used it will get VERY warm. So far it hasn't been a problem for me, but I know that kind of thing might startle some people. The included flashlight is useless, but you probably aren't buying this thing because you need a flashlight.All in all for $5 you can't really go wrong.",4
It charges my HTC G2  from about zero  to 50% with 2 AA. So I bring 4 AA just in case.I'd give it a 5 star if not for the hard to open battery compartment.,4
"The last batch of these I received was updated from the original.  The battery cover is much easier to remove and the switch on the side is smaller to reduce chances of accidental turn on in a pocket or bag. This charger features the smallest footprint you can get out of a 2xAA charger, works great with rechargeable batteries, and is cheap.  I get about 50% of a charge for the average smartphone off of 2 Sanyo Eneloops.  One of the recurring scenarios I find myself using this is at the end of the day when I am heading into a restaurant and find my phone dead or almost dead.  It's easy to hook this charger up with a 1ft USB cable and put it in my pocket.  It says it's for the iphone, but this will work for any USB charging application.",5
"Bought one to try, worked well, so bought another.  The first one burned itself up while the second one was being shipped, the second one arrived and burned itself up within about 10 seconds.  Wouldn't be a big deal but it's supposed to be for emergencies, so it's unreliability causes it to fail at the worst possible moment (which is what happened here).  Another case of you get what you pay for.  These also had that burning electronics smell and ran really hot before incinerating themselves.",1
"I love this device.  I use NiMH rechargeables in it, and carry extra sets if I might need even more power.VERY IMPORTANT TIP:Whenever possible, plug your device into this as soon as you START using it, not once the device has run out of juice!Why? These are much better for powering a fully charged device than for charging a dead device. About 4x better!This is because if you're charging a Li-ion battery, it will pull a lot of power very quickly, which batteries can provide less efficiently than if it's drawn out slowly, AND because of the energy losses inherent in converting the electrical energy to chemical energy and back to electrical energy.  It's nice that Li-ion batteries charge very quickly, except for this gotcha.That's why the cases which contain a battery, like iPhone cases and iPod cases power the device until the battery inside is dead, and only then leave the device to run on its own power.I bought mine in an auction.Run a test and see.  My tip will make a HUGE difference.  Two fully charged 2500mAh NiMH AA's, provide *way* more energy than the 930 mAh battery in an iPod touch 4G!Anther reviewer has said that two fully charged 2500mAh NiMH AA's are just enough to recharge the iPod's battery, doubling the normal ability to provide about 40 hours of audio play to about 80 hours.  But if used to power the iPod instead of charge it's battery, the total 5930mAh, should, I estimate, provide maybe 300 hours.  (That's an additional 260 hours instead of an additional 40 hours!)ANOTHER TIP: As soon as I got it, I put a piece of tape over the switch to keep it from accidentally moving it, and remove it only momentarily when moving the switch intentionally.",4
"I bought 3 of these on a whim. Well, I'm glad I did. This product works with alkaline or rechargeable batteries. I used 2 aa eneloop batteries with this to charge my Zune back to 100%, from about 75%. Then I used same to power a usb fan to cool my notebook. After that, using the same product and same 2 aa batteries, I played my Bose personal cd player for about an hour. Am I ever glad to have 3, really 2, because I gave my Uncle one. These units WORK. But they should be checked now and then.",4
"This item will get EXTREMELY hot when charging a smartphone, as will the batteries in it.It has been wired to imitate a high-power wall charger that comes with smartphones (shorting out the two center pins), but 2 AA batteries can't supply that much power, and this device clearly wasn't engineered to transfer that much power.  So, everything gets extremely hot, and you'll burn out a pair of AA batteries before it finishes charging your phone even once.If you have a low power, low-end phone, that doesn't come with a high-power charger, and never tries to draw more than 500mA, this charger might work for you, but I'd still be weary.I threw this thing in the trash, and got aTenergy T-3000USBinstead, which works infinitely better.  Other units out there may also work, but whatever you do, stay away from 'Neewer'!",1
It does charge my MP4 player or my Samsung galaxy nor does it keep them from dying. It never stays pluged in and it acts like its dead 15 minutes after pluging it into the device. Whoever wrote a good review about this product lied.,1
"This ingenious little widget converts the 3V supplied by a pair of AAA cells into 5V to run USB-powered devices, and adds a flashlight just in case you need one.",5
This iphone 4 charger is really great.  It is sturdy and solidly built.  It takes up very little space on a desk or dresser.  Highly recommended.,5
"This charger works really good, and it even improved the charge on my cell and in my wife's this is a really good product!",5
"Finally, a charging dock that I do not need to remove the case or bumper or anything to charge my iPhone. It comes with inserts for iPhone 4, and ipod (which I think would also work with the iPhone 3gs) to  fit your phone, but if you don't use any of them you can charge your iPhone without removing any case or bumper you may have on it. I hate having to remove a case or whatever to charge my phone but I like to have it upright since I use it at night as my alarm clock. This works perfectly and the additional battery is an added bonus so you always have backup battery power when needed. It also charges the phone rather quickly. My friend liked it so much, I got her one too.",5
"Good looking charging station for your iphone. The extra battery does the job well, it will charge your battery all the way to 87%, plus it comes with a cover top to carry around when not charging.",5
"Never buy anything from a seller, OEM shop, because they only sell the one without the mini-battery.  Other than take it works perfectly.",1
"I was looking for a decent looking, nice desktop charger/dock for my iPhone 4. I also had been looking earlier for an inexpensive emergency back-up battery to toss in my bag on days that I knew I'd be out on calls all day. This seemed to fit both bills so I gave it a go.I was very impressed with the weight and build of the dock. It's a matte black with a subtle rubberized coating. Even more importantly, it allowed me to keep any one of my cases (I have several that I like) on as I dock & charge. The 'lesser important' feature to me was the back-up charger/battery. This thing will almost fit in your wallet. It has a decent snap on cover. It has taken my iPod Touch from dead to 100% in a little over an hour. It will take my phone from 20% to 100% in about the same amount of time. All this and on Prime for $20? Incredible.My wife was so impressed, she asked why I didn't get a couple more (my kids are always losing or fighting over their iPod touch charging cables). I just went to order 2 more, and Amazon actually had two 'Like New' units in their Marketplace for $8 each!Seriously, I think anyone would be very pleased with this as just a quality dock. The added functionality of the very effective & portable battery charger makes this unit a no brainer and a really great deal.",5
"This is a good looking and simple charging dock for my bedside table, and the inclusion of the extra battery is a definite plus. However, it is very difficult to plug in the iphone4 even after months of daily use. The angle of the dock connector makes it difficult to simple place the phone on the dock and I find myself having to pick up the dock off the table in order to properly connect it to the phone.",3
"I don't have any problems mounting the iPhone. There are plastic adapters to accomodate different shapes. I have an iPhone 4, and it fits well without any of the adapters. I use a case on the phone and it doesn't interfere.The battery is an added bonus, but the phone charges slowly when the battery is also charging.Maybe this is a bit out of bounds, but Kensington appears to have a newer, lower priced unit. At $40-$50, I don't think this is a great value. At $20, it's a steal.",4
"i bought this for my bf and have seen what it can do. this product is great for its price. we recently put it to the test last night while waiting 4 hours in line for tron legacy at imax. his cell was down to about 65% and he had brought his fully charged charger, this product i'm reviewing, and while waiting on line, and still using his iphone for downloading updates, playing games, checking emails and such, he was able to get almost an additional 40% charge off this lil charger i got him. that was perfect! so if he was just using it to charge it could well be above 40% charge. the dock holds both the iphone 4 and battery nice and sturdy, it even provides a small connect base so all the weight of the iphone isnt on the prongs of the charger. its very easy to hookup. i'd recommend this item to anyone who uses their iphone all day and find themselves with very lil left by the end of their night, and still are out and about in the city or just away from home for that extra boost of power.",5
"This item satisfied my need for a standalone charger for the iPod touch I keep at my kid's house for FaceTime. The iPod is in a gel case. The charger was easy enough to set up, but there is an exceptional amount of fiddling required to ensure the iPod is securely in the charging dock.",3
"Despite the negative review above, I ordered this based on other Kensington products I have owned in the past. This little docking stand is great; Yes, you have to get used to knowing how to place the phone and the battery in it, but it only takes a few times and you will be able to do it blindfolded (oh, and it helps if you use your left hand!). I have one of these at home and take one with me when I travel.",5
"Absolutely love this product.  I had a dock that came with my Switcheasy case, which made docking secure and safe.  Use it every night by my bedside, but charges fast through the day if you need it.  Extra battery pack is awesome to keep in your purse, though doesn't have to much charging power but gets the job done.  Im going to get another one for my desk at work.",5
"PROS(+) & CONS(-)+Comfortable in-ear for all-day use+Microphone sound when making a phone call is crystal clear (especially compared to a bluetooth headset)-Microphone sound when making a phone call is NOT a substantial improvement over the corded headset/microphone that my phone came with-Cord is too short*-Audio sound quality is not a 'giant leap forward' like most Bose products-The cord design really stands out**+/-Volume won't allow you to turn it up to 'Your ears will be ringing after listening at this high a volume' levels (compared to other earphones I've used with my phone)*I'm 6'2' (187cm) and like to carry my phone in my back pocket.  The cord is about 6' too short to do this without getting jerked out by head movements or putting pressure on my ear doing things like sitting down and standing up.  So, I put my phone in my front pocket, which isn't as comfortable and means I have to take my phone out and put it on a table when I'm sitting down rather than just leaving it in my back pocket.**While I know the black-and-white-candy-cane cord design is intentionally made by Bose to stand out and make their brand recognizable, it means that if you are going into a meeting and want to leave your Bose headset out in your car (I used to leave my headsets in the cupholder), the cord screams to anyone that might be looking for a reason to break into your car 'I'm an expensive headset- Please steal me!'NARRATIVEI have a Bose stereo and a sound station, too, and have always regarded Bose as a leader in the audio-technology-to-save-space industry.  However, I have to say that this product just doesn't have the 'WOW!' factor that the rest of their product line normally has.  This is, in part, because this is not a noise canceling headset (which I knew before I bought it).  However, the clarity of the headset is on par with what you can get for significantly less.  I think you're better off just getting a cheaper replacement headset/microphone with high ratings for comfortable ear buds... for about $10.00.In other words, if you hear that smack/thud sound while reading this, it is me beating my head against the wall because I made this purchase.  I'm seriously considering returning it.",1
"I have used these earbuds for 4 months now and they have exceeded my expectations.  The silicon StayHear ear tips are simply a genius solution to keeping earbuds in your ear.  I have not ever been able to satisfactorily use earbuds until these came on the market because earbuds never stayed in my ear. With these earbuds I can do anything without them falling out: yard work, tree trimming, raking leaves, skiing, running, housework, you name it. The audio quality (for earbuds) is exceptional. I am an audiophile and have particularly high standards as to how I listen to music. That being said, you cannot forget these are earbuds, not high fidelity home speakers or studio quality headphones. For earbuds, the quality of sound is excellent. Enough said. The pause button on the cord near your jaw line is a nice touch, keeping you from having to access your player for a quick conversation, what have you.  If you are looking for any earbuds to perform as Bose describes, and you can get over the fact you're paying $130 for 'earbuds' (that's my BUT...coming to grips with paying that much for earbuds), BUY THESE. You won't be disappointed. I bought my wife a pair for Christmas and she's just as thrilled. One final note, if you buy these earbuds through Amazon directly from Bose, Bose offers a 30 DAY, NO QUESTIONS ASKED RETURN POLICY.  You'll probably have to pay sales tax as opposed to using another vendor, but having the flexibility to try them and return them if necessary (to me) was worth the $7.  Hope this helps.",5
"I purchased this headset for my iPad/iPhone and Nexus One. (Yes, I'm a sucker for these gadgets) I never really liked Bose products as they are usually over-hyped and I seem to get more bang for my buck if I were to go with other brands. (Yes, I have tried several Bose products.)But MIE2 may have changed my perspective on the brand.What I needed was headset first, headphone second. Bose MIE2 serves the purpose well. Unlike other 'in-ear' headsets, you can wear Bose MIE2 for hours without wearing out your ear canals. Instead of using your ear canals as support for ear piece, weird-looking StayHear adapters use your ear as a support. Very very comfortable.I was a little worried at first that they might look weird, but it's barely noticeable that you are using StayHear adapters.Quality wise, they are great for phone conversation (both microphone & ear pieces), and just 'OK' for music. Unfortunately, you can't have the best of both worlds. Highs on this headset is almost non-existent, which is bad for music, but good for phone conversation. Lack of highs = better sounding audio when the audio from the other end is bad.Length of the cable is perfect, not too long, not too short. The black/white cable design is a bit odd. But I suppose it won't look as bad as the standard Apple issued headset after years of heavy use.StayHear adapters took me about 10 minutes to get used to. They do stay on your ears better than standard earbuds without the pain of typical in-ear ear piece. -- Since they don't fit into your ear canals, they do not provide noise isolation. Bose never claim it to be. So judge it accordingly.With StayHear adapters, I suppose some would wear this headset during the work out. I'd like to point out that the microphone & button are not waterproof. The more you exposed it to sweat / water / humidity, the more likely it's going to fail.For the first couple of days, I'm very impressed with Bose MIE2 as my primary headset for conversation. It's pricey for a headset, but after months of researching/trying, noting came close to Bose MIE2. Bose claims to have designed and manufactured this headset for 'lasting quality'. That remains to be seen. If it lasts a year of heavy use, I'd say it's worth it. -- From my experience, Apple headsets only last about 9-10 months.If what you need is headphone first (for music), and headset second (for conversation), I'd recommend you try some other products first. But if your need is similar as mine, I highly recommend Bose MIE2.",5
"A perfect profound product. Has crystal clear sound which will sooth your ears and soul. I also use this with my ipod which is much better that the standard apple headset.I have read reviews about people complaining about the cost associated with the bose product on higher end. But the point is you need pay some extra to the best quality sound product, you will surely not be disappointed.Yes i would recommended this to all music lovers.",5
"I've tried about 7 different headsets from different MFGs and these are the best ones so far.  Others i have tried are from: bose, shure, b&o;, and some cheap ones.  These have the best sound of all of them and bose fixed the falling off of the ear pieces from their previous versions.i would buy a couple of more sets, but the price is prohibitive.  And here are no deals on these anywhere.",5
"These earbuds are indeed a solid performer. I still feel they are a bit overpriced but I very much enjoy them. The comfort is the absolute best I have tried. I could actually fall asleep wearing them. The little rubber hook thing works great. They don't fall out. I like the fact that they don't isolate the noise, because I mostly wear them while driving so I can answer my phone. I'm using them with iPhone4. The sound is very good as expected. Good accurate bass, nice mids and clear highs. All with a natural warm tone. All-in-all I'm very satisfied with them. There are two reasons for the 4 stars instead of 5. First is the price. They are expensive no matter where you get them. Second is the highs. Although the sound is very good it could be better. I know this because I tried another brand of upper tier buds that had better highs. Nothing else was better I might add.",4
"I purchased these for my wife and they sound better than any headset I've ever used. I've always been a fan of bose. I have bose in my car, as my home theater speakers, and I also purchased the AE2 headphones which are also great.  know what I was getting when I bought these. You can tell lights out the difference in sound especially when your talking on the phone. I could not tell my wife was on her phone, it just sounded so clear like she was talking on a landline. Normally you'll hear a little static or fading but did not with these. They are also comfortable to wear. I may buy another set for myself to use.",5
I had quite comfort 2 head set and still its like new :) Loving these earphones every day. i wear it almost > 5 hrs every day between music and calls. Great buy and recommend high.,5
"its bose headphones is there anything else to say, the sound is amazing, it works perfectly and the item is very easy to store.",5
"These are great!  My ears are not identical between left and right.  So one size will not fit both.  But these take care of that problem are are the only brand I've had that are comfortable and stay in, in both ears.  The sound is really great too.  They will never be as good as an 'over the ear' phone, and they don't have noise canceling, but these you can take with you easily and the others you can't.  I'll be a repeat customer when the time comes.",5
"Well....I have a very high standard...my $250 Monster Cable Turbine Pro Gold earbuds which are audiophile sound quality broke on me, so while waiting for a replacement from Monster, I thought I would try these Bose.VERY comfortable...can hardly feel that they are there. However, they do annoy me slightly as they feel are just resting there and on the verge of falling out, but they do stay in well with the medium tips. I had the original version of these a few years a go, these new tips with the hook thing is only a slight improvement.Sound quality is ok, but they don't handle low end bass well at all at medium-high to high volumes- distortion occurs. I have to crank the treble up with these ear-buds, otherwise they are muffled. They are nothing like my Monster Turbine Pros..but since these are half the price, I expected a drop in sound quality. The Turbine Pros literally have sub woofer quality bass that slams and the mids and highs are crisp and clean..these Bose are more flat sounding, perhaps more of a balanced sound, but lacks clarity, needing compensating in the treble department.I wanted a spare set of earbuds to use with my smartphone to listen to music while i travel on the buss to and from college classes. I didn't want to risk my expensive Monster's, so I picked up these Bose with the headset option. Well...phone doesn't see a headset, only headphones. I have a Samsung Fascinate running CynagonMod 7 (Android)...so when on a call the phone uses the built in mic on phone, which does not work for me as the phone is in my pocket....So I can't use them as a headset...only headphones. These are the universal model, not the 'i' model which is meant for iPhones..Overall, they are ok...but should be cheaper...I have heard $50 Sony earbuds sound as good as these...You are basically paying for the Bose name and the comfort factor of these.",3
"I was in search of a comfortable set of ear buds headphones.  I've have both the BOSE Quite Comfort 2 and 3 for travel.  I also have both the Shure SE210 and Etymotic ER23-HF3.  Now both of these earbuds do the job well, but I was looking for that extra extra extra comfort on those long flights.The Shure does an excellent job of blocking out noise, but it sometimes had an unusual feel for me.  They just never really felt good.  The sound was excellent and it block out noise, but they felt awkward.The Etymotic really got deep into the ear and took time to get it right, but being so deep, they irritate when worn over a long period of time.These BOSE ear buds are awesome.  They are very comfortable to where and sound great.  The comfort alone is work the money.  The do take time during the first few times putting them on, but once you get the hang of it, they are slide right in.I would have to say they are the MOST COMFORTABLE ear buds I've ever worn.  Great job BOSE with the new earbud design.Like all high end ear buds, you get a set of extra ear bud sizes to fit your ear.  They case could have been better designed that just a leather case, but I bought it for the comfort.",5
"Based on reviews of Seidio'sInnocase Surface Case for  Motorola DROID, I was excited to get this product for my new Droid X and even ordered it directly from Seidio for the full retail price (because they had them in stock sooner).  There are nice aspects to the case/holster pair, but the case that I got won't stay together very well.  I don't know if that's because of quality or design.First, what I like about the pair:- The case has a nice feel to the exterior surfaces.  It feels comfortable and soft, and it gives good grip.- The holster and case fit snugly together, and I haven't noticed any wiggle at all.- The belt clip.  One of the big reasons that I got it, as I love the convenience of being able to quickly put on and take off accessories.- The added piece of mind that I won't scratch up my phone when I carry it around or have it in my car.Now, what I don't like about the design/quality:- The case that I received has a critical flaw in that the left edge doesn't stay rigidly connected.  With the touch screen, it's pretty often that I'm swiping my fingers from side to side.  Therefore, my fingers will bump into the raised edges of the case around the screen.  On the left side, the connection between the two halves of the case is loose, so that edge moves around and begins to separate when I touch it.  I find that annoying.  I don't know if this is a quality issue or a design flaw.- The initial fit and finish of the case edges weren't very good.  They were sharp and jagged in places.  After rubbing them with my fingernails for a bit, they did smooth out.  For fifty dollars, though, I expected better.- This may be an aspect of any case for the Droid X, but I don't like how the front buttons are harder to push because of how close the case edges are to the buttons.  So, perhaps not a cut against this product, but just a comment for those looking at getting a case for the Droid X.- The top clip on the holster doesn't seem to fully open and stay open.  Honestly, this might be me not knowing how to use it properly, but it feels like mine will break if I try to open it any further.  Assuming it won't snap open, the clip is spring loaded and naturally moves to the closed position - which is perfect once the phone is inside.  When inserting or removing the phone, though, the touch screen faces the clip, and the clip could hit the screen if it slips loose from your fingers.  If you're careful, it should be fine, though.Based on DroidBoy's review that his case also won't stay together, there might be some quality/design issues for Seidio to work out.  I'll be contacting Seidio to see if I can get a replacement.",3
"I purchased this holster for my phone 9 months ago. It broke within 4 months. The clip that holds the phone in place is very thin and with normal wear/tear, it just snaps off. I got a warranty replacement from them (it took 6 weeks to get a replacement) and after 4 more months, it snapped again! I am very gentle with the holster, particularly after it snapped the first time. This product design is just no good - don't buy it.",1
This is a basic case with a solid belt clip.  I have always been pleased with Seidio products.  I highly recommend this case.,4
"I would love to have an otterbox for my droid x, but until they make one this is the best I've seen.  The case is very low profile.  It does not add a lot of bulk to the phone.  The surface is just right, not to ruff, not to smooth.  You can hold it without dropping but it's still easy to get our of your pocket.  The holster seems very sturdy as far as these types of holsters go.  The screen points into the holster, which is lined with felt.  I'm just not confident about carrying my phone in one of these plastic contraptions. Guess I'm a little old fashioned, give me a ballistic nylon holster any day of the week.  My favorite is made by nite ize.  All in all, an excellent product. 5 stars.  Oh, there is an oterbox alternative that you can add on to the case above. Can be found on the seidio web site.  Not for sale here yet as far as I can tell.",5
This is one of the best droid x holster out there. It holds the phone in place; it is solid and the phone screen can face out or in. So far I have not had a problem with it.I strongly recommend this holster. U will not regret it.,5
"I bought this item because I loved the Seidio case for my last phone, a Blackberry. I also require a case + belt clip and that combination is hard to find. Finally, I hoped this would work with the Motorola car dock, with spacer removed.In case you were wondering, it DOES NOT work with the Motorola car dock. I thought it might because Seidio brags about how thing the Surface line of cases are. Still too thick to use with the car dock. Makes me wonder what case does work with the dock because I haven't found one yet.As others have mentioned, the two piece style isn't always great. I had trouble getting the two pieces clipped together properly all the way around the phone. Never was able to get that too happen.I also noticed that the front piece of the case adds a large 'lip' around the phone, making the buttons below the screen less accessible. Also harder for my fat fingers to use the touch screen new the edges of the glass.Finally, the clip part of the belt holster is so big that you can't just slide and pop the phone in. You have to physically lift the clip up before inserting the phone all the way and releasing the clip to hold the phone in.Poor design, not one of Siedio's better products. I returned mine and now remain on the hunt for a case/holster combo that will work with the car dock. Is that too much to ask for?!?",3
"I used to own an Innocase and holster for my Blackberry Storm a couple of years ago. It was velvet lined, solidly built, and the case snapped right in the holster.I decided to try the Droid X version for my phone, and Amazon had a much better price than Seidio direct.The case itself is the dime a dozen snap together kind you see everywhere for almost any smart phone for $5. It's really thin plastic with no lining inside at all. When dust and grit collect inside, the friction between the case and the phone will cause scratches. This case would be a decent deal at no more than $25, but for what Seidio want's for it on their website ($49.99) and even at Amazon's lower price of $39.99 at the time of purchase, it's not a good deal at all.I guess I'll wait for the Otterbox cases to come out.",3
"Case seems good; nice design, holster is great, but apparently the extra half-millimeter from the extended battery completely defeats this case. Clasping clips break off/plastic is VERY fragile kind.  Probably would have broken after one fair drop, which kind of defeats the purpose.  Too bad. Getting rubberized case instead. But I'm keeping the holster!",2
I really llked this case! It is very protective and it has a very cute creamy yellow color and keeps my phone clean from all the dirt and dust that it comes in contact with.,5
I dont like this. I will stick with the more simple cases. The rubber is loose. I cant complain because i didnt pay much for it.,1
As with all otterboxes this one was very well made and provided great protection for my Iphone. And I found it at Amazon for a great price.  Now I have different colors to suit my mood,5
It is cheap and I have bought a lot of cheap cases with mostly good results. This one not some much the light sensor is not right on the case so the screen does not change as needed. The buttons do not line up on the case properly which makes the casemhard to use.  Very hard to get a part to install on the phone and even harder with the phone it it. Save your money buy something else.,1
"Loved the bright color, have several colors. So easy to slide off and change colors to go with different outfits lol",5
Very hard to work this case!!! and will notrecommend!! And i bought 3 of them and through them away.,1
it did not come with the screen prtectors it was supposed to come with over all it is a ok product,3
Case doesn't fit well and had tons of uncut places on it. Not impressed and shouldn't have ordered the three that I did. Only use dit for two days!,1
I like the fit and the way it protects my phone. I have had no problems installing the cover. Great color,5
Got this for my a friend and it was just what he wanted to go with the Seahawks green. The price was right and even though its not an otterbox it still is a perfect case and bulky.,5
The color is very vibrant. But the quality of the case is not good. I wouldn't recommend for anyone to buy,3
My son dropped his phone and it cost $150.00 to get it replace. I bought this case and he dropped his phone and nothing happen. Well worth the money.,5
it would be better if the green cover would stay on. I love the color but the cover is not strong enough to keep a grip on the phone.,2
"This is a cheap counterfeit battery, they got the label ALMOST perfect. If you look closely you will see the differences. When I installed this battery in my DroidX2, a message popped up &#34;Invalid battery Your device battery is invalid and cannot be charged. Replace the battery with an original Motorola battery.&#34;",1
"I was a little leery of this because of some of the negative reviews, but so far I can't tell any difference between this battery and the one that came with my Droid X2. They look identical, hold a charge for the same amount of time, and recharge in the same amount of time. How can you go wrong with this six buck battery? To charge it, I useRND Power Solutions Deluxe 2nd Battery Charge and Data Sync Cradle / Desktop Docking Station for Motorola Droid X & Droid X2which also works great.",5
I read the reviews and followed the advice of people who bought it from vendor TopShelf on Amazon.  I did the same and was not disappointed!  I got a brand new (Mfr date 2013) battery that was well packed and shipped quickly.  Battery came with 90% charge and we used it right away.  Phone lasted about 28 hours on the factory charge of the new battery!  The old battery was at about 5 hours before needing a charge!  The battery is working well and continuing to last well into the low 30 hours now.  Needless to say I am happy that the old Droid X got a new lease on life while I wait to upgrade to a new phone!,5
It worked exactly as described and lasted until I got rid of the phone.  I wish I didn't have to replace it in the first place. I know what would have eventually happened because I had to replace them in two different Droid Xs,3
Really needed this battery got it to hold a charge one time and now it wont even power my phone on so now im back to the original battery that can with my phone,1
"These are obviously counterfeit. They do not even pass the most cursory visual comparison to a genuine Motorola battery. Any 7-11 clerk could spot this easier than spotting a fake 20 dollar bill.They also do not work in my Droid X. One was too dead to even turn on the phone and would not charge. The other turned on the phone, but would not display battery condition, and would not charge. I got message that it was not a genuine Motorola battery.I can't believe Amazon is knowingly selling counterfeit products.Amazon states they come from OEM Planet, but my shipping label says they came from Slick Zone INC.",1
"Droid X is very new for me.  Did not take me long to realize the Batt life especially with games, bluetooth or GPS wil drain this phone quickly.  At $6 per Batt how can you go wrong.  Batt looks like orig that came with my phone.  Worked fine.  Keep one or two with you especially for field work or just a quick swap while the old batt is charging.",5
I bought this a replacement for my Droid X2 factory shipped battery. I have to say it works great. It holds a charge in my phone like the day it was new again.,5
"But in the end I regretted buying it, because switching out the battery became annoying. So I stopped doing it.",3
"I purchased 4 of these batteries, two for me and two for a friend.I have had NO problems nor have she with any of the batteries.I find No difference between these batteries and the ones from Verizon.I have had them for many months and am very happy with them!!!!",5
"Ordered these for Droid X v2.2. Batteries arrived. These are fake batteries. Nomenclature and printing on battery not as represented in photo. Not Motorola OEM. They will not be recognized, will not charge and will not work in any of the Motorola Droid series phones.",1
"This battery replaces the original part in a Motorola Droid X.  After more than two years my original had run its course.  The phone is no longer used for calling due to my upgrade to a Motorola RAZR MAXX HD but serves as a quick and handy email and social media checker, game player and music player at home.  The new battery came fully charged which was an unexpected nice touch.",5
"Super-fast shipping, battery works beautifully. I have an almost 2 year old droid x and was getting crappy battery life, assumed the phone was failing. Opted to replace the battery when the screen developed pooling which indicates battery swell. I could not even see the bulge in the battery but it was obviously there because it is gone with the new battery. Great battery life now too! I get to keep my beloved phone for much longer than expected - a win!Edited to Add: My batteries came from BTO, Inc.",5
"I received it today.  The battery appears to be what I would consider a counterfeit.  The battery is wrapped in a fake Motorola casing.  The font is different and the battery will not charge in your phone.  The phone says that the battery is not genuine, please remove it and replace it with a genuine Motorola battery.  Bottom line is don't buy it, it wont work in your phone.  Also its worth noting the this company 'Saving Guatemala Kids' is the same as the company selling the $4 charger for the battery 'AudioHaus' they ship from the same address.",1
Is as described - new OEM battery.  lasts much longer than the battery I replaced I guess I needed this more than I thought.,5
It's something my father needed to replace in his droid x. It worked well and holds a charge as it should. I haven't heard any complaints thus far,5
Great for carrying around a spare battery. Performs exactly the same as the factory battery. Exactly what I wanted for a great price.,5
"I bought this 'backup' battery for my Droid-X.Some reviewers have warned of counterfeit batteries.  If this battery is a fake, it is a really good fake - identical Motorola markings, including identical holographic tape.  And the performance is equal to the original that came with my phone - it lasts just as long, and charges just as fast.I have no reason to believe this is not an Motorola OEM battery, as advertised - at an exceptionally good price.",5
The battery is still charging as expected and I have had it for awhile.  I would recommend this product to anyone in need of another battery.,5
Not great life in this battery!,3
"I bought what I thought was BH5X battery for an extra battery on my droid X2 (as shown in photographs), but when the battery came it was a used, beat up BP6X that wasn't any where near fitting.DO NOT BUY!",1
It's a good battery.  I don't have anything else to say.  Nine more words.  Now six.  Four more. Two. One.  I'm done.,5
now my phone is back to normal.  this is a very good battery at a very good price.  I would recommend it when you need a new battery for your phone,5
"As many others, I purchased this as a spare 'emergency' battery.  Put it in the Droid X and it was already fully charged and ready to go.  No complaints at all.  Ordered it through Amazon from a 3rd party dealer, arrived w/in a week of ordering.",4
"This arrived when it was supposed to, packaging was light, which is good, it is just a battery.  The battery has been working for several months now, still good.  I would recommend this to another shopper.",5
"I think that the seller should be required to remove the 'new' descriptor from the item, since this battery was most definitely not new.  The contacts showed signs of wear and my envelope contained the same 'inspected by NNN' type little slip of paper.  So that's fine with me, to buy not new batteries to keep them out of landfills.  I'd still have chosen this battery if it had been labeled 'used', because it was only $6.  But I feel like it was false advertising calling it new.  I'd give 5 stars if they had described it accurately as 'used'.  It looks exactly like the OEM battery that came with my phone, and works just as well too.",4
I used this to replace a dead OEM Droid X battery.  It held a charge OK but wasn't anything special.  I replaced the phone before I had to replace this battery.,3
I bought this because the battery that I got with the phone has poor life. I figured this was a brand new one of the same thing so it would have better life but it was worse!,1
"My almost 2 year old Droid X2 was getting tired.  It would only hold a charge for around 4 hours a day with minimal useage.  After reading the reviews of others, I ordered this battery.  When it arrived, it looks exactly like the OEM battery that was in the phone.  I charged it up and it held for a good 8 hours with moderate use.It bought my old phone some additional life!",4
There is always a concern when purchasing a replacement battery on line.  It's hard to tell if you are actually getting a new battery or a recycled unit until you put it through the paces.This is the real deal and has been holding up to a full day's use like the original battery did when it was new. It's a good deal and shipped quickly. Far better price than going back to the phone store as well.,4
"Purchased this for my fiance, her old battery was expanding. This thing lasts twice as long as her original battery. Was a wise choice.",5
I bought this for my Droid which is almost 2 years old and I am happy with the way the battery has performed giving me a longer stay alive period against some rigorous high battery consumption applications which I use.,5
Still does not last a whole day. Not as good as the original when it was new. Still not bad for the cost.,2
"My 'original' Droid X battery lasted (2) full days at first, then got progressively worse.... only lasting 1/2 a day. I purchased this OEM replacement hoping to get back (2) full days, but despite following suggestions for full discharge before charging, this battery hasn't lasted (1) full day yet...so kinda disappointed. Could be my phone....but I'm thinking this battery is just o.k.",3
"Purchased this as a secondary spare for my Droid X.  This battery will not hold a charge and was returned.  I should have been cautious because of the price but I thought I would give it a shot..  I would say buyer beware on these batteries.Update:After writing this review, I was contacted by the seller (Top Shelf) and offered a replacement battery, which I will give them credit for attempting to make it right.  The catch to this offer though was asking me to remove my bad review.  Top Shelf swears these are original OEM batteries, but unless Motorola doesn't know how to properly spell, then these batteries that they are offering as OEM batteries are counterfeits.  The second battery that they sent as a replacement has the same words misspelled as the first battery that was bad upon arrival.  Again buyer beware, especially when dealing with this seller.",1
"when i saw the price i figured it would be a junk battery but with the 4 and a half star reviews and possitive feed backs, i decided to order one. i chose the 5-8 business days shipping i think. i ordered it thursday afternoon, it came in the mail monday morning. the battery is indeed new, there was no scratches on the metal ports on the battery, it charged in my phone and the capacity is normal. i definitely recommend buying one. i actually may buy a few more just for the price lol.",5
"I was pleased with the product for the price. I can truly say it was worth it, I did not like that I was never given a correct tracking number but I am very satisfied overall. I did see a little scratch on the battery but whatever at lease it work in my phone.",5
"Exactly what I needed and for 1/3 of the price in stores, if they even carry it anymore. My other battery got water damaged and got so thick the back door was popping off ( but the phone indicated not H2O damage- which is very strange). This phone is a back up just in case something happens to my newer phone.",5
"The battery did not last six months before becoming nearly impossible to recharge. It gets hot, consistently and even more so when it's dying (at 20% or less).",1
"It's a battery it's what I needed and it's what I got, it was much cheaper than going to a phone store.",5
"The batteries are refurbished, but are well worth it. They hold a good charge and $5 beats $40 at Verizon. Its better than you get what you pay for. Plus the Droid X has been out for a while. Why buy a brand new battery when you can upgrade your phone soon enough?",5
Glad I bought this item the battery so far works great and it was charged when i got it ...very pleased,5
"Update: I bought this in November 2012 and posted the review shown below. I've been using the battery for 6 months now and it's almost dead! The battery barely lasts one day. And I am a light user of my phone. BUYER BEWARE!!Original review: My original 2 year old battery needed a charge every 24 to 36 hours. This new battery is about the same. It lasted for 2 days for the first 2 days, now it's just like my old battery. I don't use my phone a lot, so it should last a lot longer than it does.The batteries did not look new. It had a few scratches and it was faded. My old battery looked newer.",1
"Sadly in this case, if you buy a battery for 15% of what it normally sells for you get 15% of a battery. After just a few days it wont charge all the way, I think the voltage must be inconsistent coming out of these these things causing strange behavior in my phone. They appear to be genuine, but they must be rejects for some reason. Save your 5 bucks, its better spent on a sandwich than this battery.",1
"Do not buy for Droid X!!!!  Phone does not recognize the battery, it actually has a ? mark over the battery on the main screen.  It does power your phone, but for a very short time.  Not sure if it is safe to use it.  Bought two of them and now wished I didn't!!!Was told I would receive a full refund, but it never came!  Avoid this seller!!!!",1
"I have had a Droid X for two years. The battery life got shorter and shorter over time. So I ordered this as a replacement. The battery I received does last longer than what I have in my phone. But my original battery used to last longer when it was new. The original went from having to charge every 1.5 to 2 days, to twice a day. This battery has to be charged once a day. According to the date on the battery, it is about 1 year newer than what I had in my phone. It is an improvement and I am keeping it!",4
"I ordered this battery this month and was a 'Fulfillment by Amazon' item.  I am not sure if these batteries are supposed to new or not, as the Motorola name was painted over.  I charged this battery upon receipt and used it the next day.  It did not preform like the original battery.  Charged it again and died within an hour.  It will most likely end up in the battery recycle bucket. No recommendation here.",1
"This item was exactly as described and the price was great.  I would definitely recommend it and purchase this item again.  Wish the battery that came with the phone would just last longer, but having this made it much easier with swapping batteries.",5
"These appear to be completely authentic OEM batteries.  I bought one as a spare, and it works just as well as, and looks just like my original battery.  I have purchased cheap batteries online for cell phones before, and they always suck, and never provide the battery life of your original.  This one is the exception to that rule, and they are cheap!  The price fluctuates from time to time, but this is the way to buy replacement batteries for your Droid X.Buy it knowing that it 'may' not be brand new (according to information in other reviews, and the very low price).  But for the price, who cares!  It works just like a new battery, so what's the difference?  I am very pleased with my purchase.",5
"For this price you cannot beat them. I mean, maybe they don't lasst as logn as the original. I don't know but I do know that I never needed the third battery. I just rotated them with my original and never had a problem. Lasted long enough for me.",5
"No, the price is NOT too good to be true folks!  It's a true OEM battery and it works great with my Droid X!  It even came already 80% charged which was a pleasant surprise! :)",5
"I've been swapping back and forth and between my original battery, and this purchased battery. I've noticed no difference whatsoever. Like other reviwers mentioned, it's not a new battery. But it works like it's new. I'd expect it to, because the Droid X brand isn't that old to begin with. Why spend a ton of extra money, when you can get the same performance from a slightly used battery? I primarily bought this so that in the future (like two or three years down the road), I will still have a good working battery to replace my worn-out battery. By then, these batteries will probably be very difficult to find for a decent price.",5
This is an OEM Motorola battery with warranty. It holds a charge very well and has never let me down.,5
"Battery does not hold a charge, I know that the phone is in working order so it is not the phone. Don't buy!",1
I was skeptical from reading other comments about how the battery was going to work. It arrived right on time and in great condition. It was completely drained out. I put it in my phone and started charging. Did fine and works great now! Still I am not sure whether it works better (lasts longer) than my original battery but I have so far used it once. It's original...,5
My phone doesn't even recognize the battery at all so it's pretty much worthless. The battery didn't come in any kind of packaging either.,1
"All seemed well when plugging into the phone.  But within 2-3 weeks it hardly held a charge.  After ordering I started reading reviews stating the battery was old.  When I looked at the date on the battery it, too, was old.  Buyer beware!  Wasn't worth the hassle fighting the vendor.",1
"Droid X phone for which this battery is advertised didn't recognize battery, wouldn't charge it.Advertised as OEM, photo shows the stock, OEM battery, this battery didn't work at all.Move along, citizen, nothing to buy here...",1
"Purchased as a replacement for my daughter's Droid  X, and it worked perfectly.  No problem holding a charge, lasts just as long as the original one did.  Good price also.  Shipped in a timely fashion.",5
I'm very disappointed in that it won't close and/or stay closed.  I wish I could get my money back! But it's pretty.,2
"I was really excited to get this case.. Waited a long time for it to come, which I didnt enjoy. When I finally got it and opened it I was very let down. The color is darker then the picture. Its not a 'hot pink' by far. But I already dropped it a few times and its still holding up good. So a good case but not the right color.",3
"It didn't feel like rubber at all, it was mainly a hard case.  It is a great case, very protective.",5
this product true in color fits phone perfect. anyone that like having there ohone covered in stylego to this Merchant and look at there products. and they back up there products.,5
Very nice simple case. Not very protective or your phone but its a nice color. A nice shiny pink color. Fits well and very happy with it.,5
"The case fits great, but there are two pieces that snap together, and the pieces (color wise) do not match each other.",2
"The IPhone car mount comes with two methods of mounting, one is on the car windshield, and the other on the vent.  Mounting from the windshield is much easier, but it depends on how large this mount/phone can become distracting to your windshield vision.  You can pivot the mount for landscape view of the GPS.  The arm of the mount is sturdy and the suction works well, making adjustments with confidence that it won't become dislodged.  The spring-loaded clip seems sturdy and supportive.The cradle for the phone is where the sound amplifying wires are located.  I think the amplifying was not much more, but a little noticeable.  The amplifying is meant to double the sound, but I did not quite experience that quality of amplification.Attaching this to the vents is more challenging and apparently, some vehicles provide easier attachment, and I chose the window mount.  Much better, and with a cleaner look.  But, you can choose to leave the phone in the cradle, easy to remove if needed.  ........Rizzo",4
"This product is a nice option for mounting your iPhone 4 in your car. The product is nicely packaged, but no printed information is included. You have to go to their website and search for the videos that show you how to mount the holder either to your windshield or vent. If you live in California as I do, it is illegal to mount something to the windshield. That leaves the other option of mounting it to the vent. I was able to mount it to the vent with a bit of difficulty, but the holder stayed put. It does swivel between portrait and landscape positions and is especially useful if you have a GPS program on your iPhone. It was great to be able to use my Co-Pilot Live GPS on my iPhone while driving and the vent mounting makes it easy to see without distracting from my driving. The boosted sound is great. I was able to hear turn by turn directions and music fairly clearly. You can mount and unmount when needed and it is a nice product to have, especially if you don't have a GPS program in your car. I recommend this product, though I hope they do include printed material in future releases instead of sending everyone to the website. It does take some searching to find the right version of this product to learn how to mount it.",4
"This mount is simple to use. There is a universal connector at the back and you can use either the windshield mount or the vent mount. Using the vent mount is as simple as clipping it on to your vent and took me 2 seconds. It self adjusts to the width of your vent. The windshield mount is also angled appropriately and is very sturdy so you can punch numbers on the phone while it is attached to the mount. However, if you mount it too high you will have to make sure that your charging cord is long enough.All models of iPhone fitted comfortably with cases on them. I am not sure if it actually amplifies sound. However, the other features of this mount are useful enough to buy it. It looks a lot better than some cheap eBay versions out there.",4
"I played with this for a while after the company sent me one to review and tried putting it in a couple of different cars to see how it worked out. It was very easy to mount it to the vents and it gets a surprisingly good hold on my iPhone. I haven't had any problem at all with it keeping a solid grip.I didn't notice as much of a difference with the sound as they claimed there would be. I even tried removing the case from my phone to see whether that was interfering with the sound boosting function and it didn't seem to have any effect.Considering the price point of this mount, I would definitely recommend it to other iPhone users as a worthwhile purchase.Edit: My mother was unhappy with another mount she had, so I bought one of these as a gift to her. I've been using the vent attachment for my 3GS, and she's been using the suction cup (though on a disk attached to her dashboard, not the windshield) for her iPhone 4 and they're both still working out great as holders. However, she also reports that she doesn't feel it really makes a meaningful difference for the sound.",4
"DESIGNThis is a very interesting design.  All they did was took a regular iPhone holder and added a 'cone' or outlet under the speaker and direct the sound out the right side out of a much larger plastic opening.  Others have done it with docks and such, so Kensington did it in the car.  The microphone also is 'coned' and it goes through it windscreen and out the bottom.  The arms holding the phone are spring loaded and open wide.COMPATIBILITYIt works well with my iPhone 4 with mySwitchEasy TRIM Hybrid Case for iPhone 4 (Black  Fits AT&T; iPhone)and it could hold bigger cases, too.  Since my case isn't rounded in the back (like the iPhone 3GS), it is tough to get into the holder with one hand. Since I don't want to remove my phone from the case, there is a gap between the speaker itself and the 'cone,' so it won't be able to capture the sound as well and amplify as loudly.It holds an iPhone 3GS in aSwitchEasyRebel Case For iPhone 3G (Skeleton)just fine, BUT the speaker is on the left of the 3GS, so that is why Kensington has this product marked as compatible with the iPhone 4 only. With the rounded case, it slides into the holder with a slight push.It has a nice, large suction cup with flexible arm for windshield use and a vent attachment. While my Garmin suction cup falls of with temperature changes, this suction cup hasn't come off yet (I've had it for about a year).  The arm is 7 inches long, which makes it very nice to put the phone exactly where you want it when using the suction cup.  In my 2002 Grand Am or 2004 Jeep Liberty, the vent holder wouldn't work.  It looks like you need to have vents that are not too deep and with decent spacing in between the fins to fit this. With the 7 inch arm, it can be nice to get it closer to you, but it also tends to be a little bit wobbly.All of my charging cables are able to be put into the bottom connector of the phone while in the mount.SOUNDIt does help amplify the sound some, but it seems to me that it only really helps much if the output of the sound it facing you.  They designed it with the sound going out the right side (the speaker is on the right side of the phone), so if you are the driver and this is in the middle, the sound will be going away from you.  If you have it sideways, you have a choice to point the sound up or down.  It sounds the best to me with the sound directed upwards as the driver, which is not how I use the phone.One thing I had to be careful with is the position of the phone in the holder.  The arms allow is to move left-to-right, which can make the speaker move off of the 'cone' gathering the sound.Overall, this is a really great holder if you are not expecting a high fidelity powered amplifier.",4
"I have been looking for a windshield car mount for my iphone and liked the idea that this one would amplify my sound.  I use the gps on trips with my iphone and find that it tracks more consistently without losing signal if it has a clear view of the sky (rather than being mounted near the lighter outlet of my vehicle).This mount grips the iphone securely and has a strong suction to my windshield.  It will rotate, which is nice since I like the GPS in landscape mode.  It also expands/opens far enough that I can leave my speck case on the iphone while mounted.  The length of the arm was nice and you can bend it as needed.  It's fairly stiff BUT due to the length of the arm and weight of the iphone, it will wobble from time to time.  It's a little annoying at first, but I got used to it.It also comes with a vent mount, which works great if don't mind it being lower.  From my brief testing, it held everything in place securely and was a pleasant addition if I'm not using my GPS app.I tried the sound amplification with and without my case on it.  I noticed a slightly louder sound, mostly because the background instruments were louder (not voices).In the end, I like the mount but the sound improvement is not enough to be considered in equation of whether this is worth spending your money on...only buy it if you want a good windshield and vent mount that has a bit of wobble in it.",4
"Let me preface my review by saying this is the 5th iphone window mount I've owned in a few years. I use my iphone nearly daily for GPS travel and, consequently, I apparently wear them out quickly.I gave up on window mounts awhile back after I finally got one that attached to my airconditioning vent...it was perfectly at the right level and didn't block my vision or advertise I had an iphone if I chose to leave it in the car if I wanted to pop in for some errand. So, while I use this one only with the vent clips again, I will add I tried the window mount just for the review and it worked very well if that's your preferred method. It snapped on easily and held well.  As for the vent mount, I have the oddest vents in an unusual car and it adjusts to fit any size vent and air goes around it...it wont keep you too hot or too cold 'cause it sits at the vent mount, if you choose that.Why this is my favorite mount for my iphone? Because it is, thus far, the ONLY one that allows me to slip my phone in and remove it with one hand...just clip in and clip out and the clips are on the side...important because it seems like those that hold it from the bottom primarily wear out easily...but, most importantly, regardless of whether I have a thick iphone case on it or no case, it adjusts automatically to still hold it tightly. The ones that just let it lay in the clip jiggle around and make it hard to read when using ipod or GPS...the ones that clip on very tight or require a special case to hold it to the mount, mean I can't use an iphone case or I cant't remove it with the flick of a wrist.At first I only gave this product 4 stars because I didn't see any difference in the sound amplification. However, I was using a 3Gs on it at the time. As soon as I used the iphone4, I DID see that it amplified the sound. So it should be noted, if you have an iphone that is not the iphone4, it will fit perfectly in the holder and you can keep it charged as you use it since the bottom is open for your charge plug to connect. It will grip the larger phone just fine...but, if you aren't using the iphone4, the sound amplification feature will not be present.  I like it enough that I'm still using it for both our 3Gs and iphone4.  And, I should note, if you DO have the iphone4, you WILL notice the sound amplification feature engage.this one is my favorite.",5
"I really, really like this mount. It's easy to slip the iPhone into, it stays securely in place, and it's a tremendous relief not to have to dig around the crevices in my dashboard and passenger seat to try and figure out where the iPhone slid to while I was driving.However, the amplifier function is only so-so. I noticed a little sound amplification, but it's not a rich, stereo sound or anything, and I don't think it's meant to be. I guess it helps to strengthen the volume of the iPhone enough to hear over normal traffic/parking lot noise. I wouldn't play music through it on a regular basis.I recommend it as a mount first, volume amplifier (distant) second.",4
"This Kensington 'SoundWave Sound Amplifying Car Mount' is a very good solution for iPhone and iPod Touch users. This works better than expected in most regards, with the following observations:Pros -+ Mounting Options; includes a very good suction cup Window Mount that has a nice adjustable arm and a Vent Mount that clips securely on the heat\AC vents (some states also prohibit window mounted devices)+ Secure; grip is tight enough to hold the iPhone or iPod Touch, even when rotated upside down and going around corners+ Easy to Use; really couldn't be easier to setup and adjust+ Amplifies Sound; no connection or power required, the moderate amplification is purely 'mechanical' (see 'Cons', below)Cons -- 'Tinny' Sound; as noted above, the unit does amplify the sound but it is only good for voice since music sounds much more 'tinny'Misc -* While this will hold other iPhone models and iPod Touch, the sound amplification only works with the iPhone 4This does provide a convenient holding place that really beats leaving the iPhone on the seat or dash. We have two cars that we move this between so only use the Vent Mount since it is so easy to disconnect and connect.Recommended!CFH",4
"Having been a volunteer EMT back in college, I saw enough accidents to conclude that there is no way that I want to cause or contribute to a car accident by paying attention to my phone rather than the road. I therefore usually find myself having to ignore calls while driving, or pulling over to pull out my phone. Needless to say, I miss a lot of calls while I drive. That makes my boss irritated.I received this Kensington-made device today and was excited to give it a try. It took exactly 10 seconds to attach to my car's windshield. I was able to set it up in a location that in no way interferes with my view of the road - an important consideration. I then attached the device using the climate control vent attachment and found that it too took a very short period of time to set up. I placed my iPhone 4 in the cradle, leaving it within its bumper case (I hate the case, but I hate dropped calls more...).The bumper case did not interfere with fitting the phone in to the cradle. Surprisingly though, it also did NOT interfere with the enhanced sound quality that this car mount kit is supposed to offer. I placed three calls from the phone while it was in the cradle and found that the sound quality is MUCH better than when I hold the phone in my hand and use speaker-phone. The people that I called all said that I sounded crystal clear to them, and that they thought I was holding the phone to my head rather than using speaker-phone.I'm a convert.Please note that this is NOT a powered device. It does not require a power plug connected to the cigarette lighter, and does not draw power from your phone. It achieves the improvement in sound quality by collecting and directing sound rather than allowing it to radiate out in all directions evenly.If you HAVE to take a call and do not have a bluetooth-enabled car stereo system, you should be using this device, or one like it.",5
"The Kensington SoundWave car mount system isn't nearly as fancy as you might think. It is basically just an adjustable suction-cup mount that attached to your windshield (or optionally to a vent) and holds your iPhone (whether or not it already has a protective case) conveniently visible while you drive. There are no electronics, it is just plastic - the sound amplification is accomplished via physics, not electricity. The amplification worked well enough that it was noticeably better (both speaking and listening) then the phone by itself, although not nearly as good as a true handsfree bluetooth system.The most useful aspect of this mount was that it is adjustable and places the iPhone conveniently within your field of view, allowing you to see what is on the screen without taking your eyes off the road or hands off the wheel like you might if the phone was sitting next to you in the center console of your car. It was easy to see incoming text messages and notifications, and tap on the phone's screen to make a call. GPS apps are also much more usable since the phone is mounted like a GPS.The only negative of this device are that because of the way the mount is designed, the iPhone will bounce around in space as you drive. The adjustable arm is just too long to be held steady. You can always use the alternate vent-based mount to provide for a steadier screen, at the price of losing one of your vents.",4
"The smartphones have been steadily increasing in power over the past few years, and have come to the point where they can execute almost any functionality of the stand-alone specialized devices. Nowhere is this more visible than in the realm of GPS car navigation. The sensitivity and functionality of the best smartphones are on par with, or even exceed in some respects, dedicated GPS navigators.One of the main obstacles to even the wider adoption of smartphones as navigation devices is the extra investment that one has to make for dedicated software and a mount. Furthermore, most smartphones have very weak external speakers. Some of the recent car models are Bluetooth enabled and you can stream smartphone's sound through the car speakers. However, this option can be sometimes buggy and difficult to set up.This iPhone 4 car mount from Kensington provides a convenient and easy way of amplifying the sound from your phone. The mount uses passive sound amplification. This means that it doesn't use any electronic means of amplifying the audio signal, but it relies instead on the carefully designed acoustics of the case to achieve the amplification. At first I was skeptical of the claim that the sound volume will be doubled, but my skepticism was quickly laid to rest when I tried it out. The sound was definitely noticeably louder with the iPhone in the mount than without it. Whether it's exactly twice the original volume I am unable to determine, but that sounds very plausible to me.The mount feels a bit cheap in quality, but otherwise it is pretty sturdy. The arm of the mount is fairly long. This may be useful for a better view of the iPhone while you are driving, as well as for the better sound volume. If your windshield is not far from the driving wheel then at first you may find the iPhone to be too close to your face. The suction cup is very effective, and will not use suction for months at the time (I have actually tried this). The flexible arms of the holder allow you to use the iPhone with or without the additional bumper or the case. You can also put other iPhones, smartphones, or even stand-alone GPS navigators into the cup - it is truly versatile. However, the sound amplification will not work with most of these other devices. There is also a vent mount in this package that allows you to position the iPhone on one of the AC vents.Overall, this is a very good product that delivers on its basic premise. If you are considering using your iPhone 4 as a GPS navigation device then I would definitely recommend this mount as a good option.",5
"I'm surprised this works as well as it does.I put an iPhone 4 16gb in the cradle, and it made it much easier to hear.  Not just louder, but clearer (in a way... you can tell the sound is going through some distortion, but it was much easier for me to hear the other end of the call), over the sound of my car.  It's a very clever idea to channel the sound inside the cradle like an old fashioned bullhorn.  I don't have to waste money on a bluetooth speakerphone (ironically, I just got one) or FM transmitter, and I can devote my car's outlet to charging the iphone (the cradle accommodates the Apple port perfectly).I did have to aim the device to get the best results, but it's not very hard to do.The cradle itself is very well constructed, using suction or simply clipping onto my car's airvents (I chose the latter because it's harder to see from outside the car when I'm parked).  It's holding the phone in place nicely enough that I'm comfortable hitting the phone with my finger without being too gentle (a pet peeve of mine).So it actually works as advertised and is well built.  This is a clever device and I recommend it over other cradles.  I think all smartphone users should invest in a cradle because it's much safer to get the phone out of your hands, in my opinion.",5
"I had a cheaper version of this made by a different manufacturer that was problematic because it did not fit the phone properly and was difficult to remove from the vent once installed.The build quality on this was better than expected. The arm is strong and the cradle is well-designed overall. The bottom of the mount has a cut out that allows for in vehicle iphone/ipod charging if you have the 12 volt charger. The side arms were unexpectedly fantastic. They really hold the phone well and are self-adjusting to fit the phone perfectly. My last one had to be adjusted manually.On to sound amplification - this is what is supposed to separate this mount from the others available on the market. I found the amplification to be good at times and at other times I noticed no difference. In each test I held the phone and then placed it in the cradle to see if I could tell the difference. I played several songs from iTunes as well as making a couple of phone calls. Overall, the amplification is probably oversold on this mount, but it is there and that small difference might help some people.Surprisingly, this fit my Blackberry and my iPod touch perfectly, so it's not just for iPhones, although the amplification feature is probably better suited to iPhones/iPods.This can be installed either on a vent or a windshield, but keep in mind that during the summer you'll probably be wanting the vents to blow cold air, so I would recommend the windshield mount.One last note- if you are buying this for you iPod Touch 2g/3g that the headphone jack is on the bottom and will be inaccessible if you are currently running a 3.5 mm male to male headphone jack to the aux on your car stereo or a 3.5 mm male to cassette adapter. In that case, this will not be the right mount for you without modification. Hopefully Kensington listens and makes a mount like this for people like me that like to use their iPod touch as their music library for their car stereo. I'm not knocking a star off for this though since this was designed for the iPhone, not the iPod Touch. The reason I knocked a star is because I was not overly impressed with the amplification. In all other aspects, this is a fantastic mount.",4
"What can be said? It's a neat concept - a horn-shaped passage leads from one speaker output (not both) to amplify the sound. And it is noticeably louder, albeit mostly on the treble. In fact, you may need to dial down the volume if you're on speakerphone to avoid feedback. It's a smart-looking holder, to boot, and it can rotate.However, I couldn't figure how to insert the phone with one hand as described. Perhaps the case was interfering? You can easily remove it with one hand, though.",4
"I have an iPhone 4.  I have been looking for a holder for my car for weeks.1.  VENT MOUNT:  the vent mount works great for me (2005 Mazda Tribute) as long as its attached to a vent that doesn't move up/down, only side to side.  The case/holster + vent mount w/ phone are too heavy for vents that can move up/down (at least mine.)  The vent holder can be adjusted slightly to allow you to get the best viewing angle.  It stays on securely = I'm pleased w/ this part of the product.  I use it both w/ my slim phone case and w/out.2.  HOLSTER/CASE:  I was was intrigued by the 'sound amplification' feature - frankly, I don't really notice this (as in I don't hear any type of amplification in the case/holster vs. out of it.)  The case/holster that goes between the windshield mount and the vent mount is quite nice, substantial, easy to get phone in/out of, phone is securely in place, nicley goes between landscape and portrait mode, am easily able to use my car charger w/ this = I'm pleased w/ this part of the product.  Again, I use both w/ my slim phone case and w/out.3.  WINDSHIELD MOUNT:  its a crapshoot when you get one that doesn't have a flexible neck - this is 1 solid piece = if it doesn't fit just so on your particular dashboard, you can't adjust and this is the case w/ my vehicle.  The only place it fits is over by the passenger side.  Due to the upward angle this mount puts my phone at, I get too much screen glare to have it on the drivers side of the windshield (because my dashboard is higher on the drivers side and angles down on the passenger side) = can't use this in my vehicle.  I knew this was a risk when I ordered this.  The windshield mount is well made and does attach securely to my windshield.  If they were to make the neck on this a flexible neck, then this product would be perfect!",3
"It works well, however, if it can be extended 3 inches long, then it will be perfect fit for my Merceedes C240.I like it, especially the sound output is louder.",4
"This is a great mount.  It hold either iPhone 3 or 4 easily and securely in any orientation, releases easily, and has 2 mounts-- a gizmo that grips onto vent openings, and a suction cup mount that has a vacuum lever on it to make it really grip.The mount itself has a passive sound amplifier-- basically like a mini-megaphone which ingeniously fits over the iPhone's speakers.  It's not dramatic, but it really does increase the sound volume, and is a nice free extra to an already good mount.",5
"As I write this review, there are 45 four and five star reviews, 7 three star reviews, and just 4 two and one star reviews.  You people writing the four and five star ones - did you get the same thing I did?Wow.  What an ineffective piece of plastic that arrived from Amazon to my doorstep.  Every time I try getting a piece of 'helper tech' to do something (in this case, bypass the need for a Bluetooth connection for my iPhone, since I don't have that in my car), it never seems to work.  The reviews looked OK, so I took a shot.  I should have known better.Hooked this thing up, and got no noticeable increase in volume for me.  It was effectively an 'iPhone holder'.  I didn't even get so far as to see how the mount work would in my truck, as I never got it working with the 'amplifier'.  Perhaps the enclosed compartment in my car might have helped, but I was so frustrated with the thing, I never bothered.Bah - save your money.  If you want music played in your car from your phone, do it the right way.  Bluetooth.",1
"I had been wanting to get an iPhone/iPod holder for my car for some time now.  When I saw this available I jumped at at based on the picture alone.  I was a little disappointed in that the picture shows a connector which, based on the price, I thought would provide charging and play audio.  Well, there is no cable included so neither charge nor sound.  I would have known this if I fully read the description.  Also, I was hoping the mount would be able to hold other things like and iPod Nano or even TomTom.  It can't.  At least not securely.  The side supports have limited give and can not be adjusted.  Again, had I read more carefully, I would have seen that it was designed specifically for iPhones.  Despite all this the mount does work as well.  The build quality is good.  The arm and vent mounts are as good as I have seen.  The arm is the real standout as it holds the most secure and is easily adjustable on the fly.  The vent mount is a little tough to adjust as all vent mounts.  The iPhone holder is nice and sturdy.  It does amplify the sound but the 2x claim is a bit exaggerated.  The phones sits well and securely.  A nice feature is the ability to rotate the iPhone.  Despite its limitation to be used with pretty much only a iPhone it works well and is built solidly.  I think it is a little expensive especially if you don't/can't use the windshield arm mount.  If you are willing to pay a premium and really only need it for an iPhone then this is a good one.",4
"I was able to fairly easily attach this to the windshield. I also tried the vent attachment, but could not make that work and I didn't think it look very sturdy. Temperatures are mild now, so I wonder if it will stay attached when the Midwest extreme temps hit. My iPhone is in a slimAmazonBasics Leather Case for AT&T; and Verizon iPhone 4 (Black)and it fits quite snuggly in this item. I tried it out for amplification using speaker phone and I could not hear and the person I was talking to could not hear either. My car is a little noisy to be fair. When I use a Bluetooth headset, it is fine to use the holder. Overall, I like it as a holder, but it doesn't help with amplification.",4
"yes i brought this after seeing it at the apple store, better price here. i like the way it holds the iphone.",5
"When I selected the Kensington SoundWave iPhone 4 compatible sound amplifying car mount, I considered it an inexpensive gimmicky item.  When the package arrived, I quickly opened it and attached my iPhone to the Kensington SoundWave.  Immediately, I knew my first impression was wrong.The Kensington SoundWave sound amplifying car mount doubles the iPhone 4's volume without any battery drain.  The package contains both window and A/C vent mounts for selecting your vehicle's best option.  Flexible arms on the pivoting cradle allow for easy insertion or removal, while keeping the iPhone securely in place.  The cradle is also designed to allow the charging cable (not included) to stay connected during use.While the sound is significantly amplified, there is a small amount of distortion.  Some of the base is lost, resulting in a slightly tinnier sound.  However, this is the extent of the distortion as there is no additional grain or fuzziness caused by the amplification.In states like CA or MN, using the window mount may be illegal.  In these cases, using the simple to install A/C vent mount is advised.  Two spring locking vent arms on the top are pushed into the venting, while a third bottom bracket uses the mounting's weight to stabilize the A/C vent mount.  The cradle is snapped onto the mount and is ready for use.  The location of the mounted iPhone facilitates use for hands free applications such as using the phone on speakerphone or following a GPS navigation application's (application sold separately) directions.If you're looking for an inexpensive iPhone 4 car mounting bracket, the Kensington SoundWave mounting system is a worthy option with the advantage of amplified sound.  Install is simple, and Kensington's design does precisely what they claim it does.PROS:Amplifies sound from your iPhoneIncludes a window and A/C vent braceNo battery drainInexpensive useful deviceCONS:Amplified sound has a slight tinny quality",5
"I'm really not a fan of this car mount.  First, I tried the vent attachment.  As I was driving, the bumps in the road, as well as just moving down the road caused the vent attachment to bounce so violently that I thought it might break my air vent.  I then tried the suction mount, and not only did the suction not work, but the phone was too far away to actually hear any kind of amplification in volume.  Sure, the volume was louder, but if you do any kind of highway driving, the volume just won't cut it.  You won't hear anything, and the person on the phone with you won't hear anything.  I'm pretty disappointed in this car mount.",1
"There are definitely qualities to like about the Kensington SoundWave Sound-Amplifying Car Mount, but there are also several that I don't like about it.  For the price, I have to say that the whole package definitely rates a three-star review, and while I was tempted to say four, I just couldn't.The sound amplification is noticable, but not what I was hoping for, and even then it wasn't very clear.  The suction disc is strong, but a flaw I've found in several of these products is that the arm just isn't flexible enough to get it where I want it, nor is it rigid enough to keep it there when I come close.  I actually like the vent-mount option because it makes it look as if the iPhone is part of the dashboard, but this has been one hot summer, and when you're cranking the A/C (or the heat in the winter) some of what you bought it for is lost in the translation, and, comically, I really do worry about freezing or grilling my phone!It's a simple device for a good price, and while it's not solid state, it's built well enough to last as long as a $25 mount should.  I can't give a glowing recommendation for this mount, but there aren't many better products that I've seen so far that aren't three or five times the price.",3
"I've tried a few car mounts for iPod, which I use to play music through the aux input on my car stereo. This is the nicest mount I've tried yet. The phone goes in easily and automatically secures itself. The suction mount and arm make it easy to find a good place to mount your phone. I don't care for the vent mount though. I do not have an iPhone 4 but I tried out a friends and the sound amplification was very good for a non-powered mount. Any iPhone 4 user should get this so they have easy access to their phone without holding it and increased sound volume.Update: When I initially installed this it was slightly touching my dash. It has since scratched the dash so I relocated it and it holds well without causing scratching to my dash. I just thought I would add this comment so you can avoid my mistake.",4
"I don't have a GPS system in my rather old car (1996 Jeep) so I rely on my iphone for direction when I need them. I find that it actually is a quite good one since it can actually show where you are on the map. However I don't have anything to mount it with and keeping it on my lap isn't exactly the safest plan there ever was.So even without the amplifying part, this device served  its purpose. However the sound amplifying portion really does make a huge impact. I don't like the headsets and I have a loud enough voice that people on the other end can hear me. This tool allows me to hear them.A lot of ipod accessories for cars can run you over a hundred dollars. This car mount is really affordable and will make a huge difference in driving. Sure GPS's have gone down in price but why bother when this mount will do you just fine.",5
"I like this product, but would like it to have a little longer arm to fit my vehicle better. I guess they stopped making the one that had a longer arm. This works good, but falls off once a month since the arm isn't long enough to reach the top of my dash for support. It has served its purpose well.",5
Sound amplification doesn't work. First of all the speaker is on the top while it's sound amplification is on the bottom. I don't get it. But as a phone holder it works great. No issues.,4
"This is really a great product that is nifty in how it works! iPhone's built-in speaker is pretty weak, so what the SoundWave does is basically put a megaphone against it to make it louder.It's simple, it's wireless, it never requires new batteries like an external speaker would, and it works!You're a bit limited on the volume, which is significantly louder than the built-in speaker, but may not be quite enough to overcome the loudest of road noise, but the SoundWave does a sufficient job.The arm of the mount is as perfect as they come in terms of rigidity vs. flexibility, and the claim that the mount will fit the phone even if you have a case on is absolutely true; it fit my iPhone 4 with case just fine.The drawbacks are that this unit doesn't include a charger (though Kensington smartly provides room for one in the bottom of the mount) and when I said the SoundWave is like a megaphone for your iPhone, I mean both in volume and also in loss of a bit of fidelity. The quality loss isn't enough to be unintelligible and it's certainly better than a gym coach barking through a megaphone, but you definitely notice your iPhone will sound a bit... different.At any rate, this product works as advertised and shows true innovation in a crowded bunch of iPhone mounts. Well done, Kensington.",4
"I sure was hoping this would be a good hands-free option in the car, because using a speaker phone sometimes isn't loud enough on the highway. Sad to say, the little chamber gives about a 5% increase in volume and zero in tone. I though the lower frequencies would enhance a LITTLE due to the reflex chamber that the sound travels in, but there's no measurable difference. I did most testing with myIncipio NGP Case for iPhone 4 (Matte Black)on. I did remove the case and mount the iPhone bare and there was a slightly better tone and increase of volume, but not enough to make note of, plus that defeats the convenience aspect.However, on a good note, the mounting arm for the windshield works great. I plug my iPhone into my car stereo with a cable to use as an iPod, and the arm keeps it right there, easy reach. I don't tie up my iPhone using it as a GPS, but the mounting arm would work very well for that if you have a GPS app. There's also a mount that clips into your AC vents, and that isn't worth the plastic its made of, the weight of the phone makes the whole thing droop down. FAIL. The windshield mounted arm is the way to go, and the mount itself is worth the cost of this device. It adapts to whatever size case you have on the iPhone, nice feature.",3
This was bought thru Amazon warehouse deals; great buy for what i needed it for...but does NOT amplify meaningfully...at least not to this reviewer.,3
"The Kensington SoundWave works very well for the iPhone; however, we're hoping to find a better placement within our vehicle.For those of us who prefer an open view of the road and prefer *not* to drive with objects attached to the windshield, the only other option is the air vent attachment.  However, in the winter driving with the heat on; or the summer blowing cold air, this product should not encounter extreme temperatures whether hot or cold.So, the only option is to mount it somehow with Velcro or let it sit in the cupholder area. Amplification works as promised, but the only challenge is finding a good mounting spot for our particular vehicle.",5
"UPDATE (June 22, 2011): Broken! The right 'arm' that grasps the iPhone snapped off so this has become useless.  I'll be contacting Kensington about a replacement shortly, but not too thrilled about the short life of this new version.  Hopefully this was a fluke.  I'll update with my results.Original review (Dec. 14, 2010): I have to admit that I'm a little biased - I fell in love with this product when I had an Iphone 3G, and then was crushed when I got my Iphone 4 only to find out that Apple swapped the places of the microphone and speaker, making that version obsolete for me.  I'm thrilled to get my hands on another one because it made the Iphone's just-a-bit-too-quiet speaker entirely usable in a noisy car environment.I now rely on my Iphone 4 for navigation duties with the TomTom app, but it's often hard to hear the commands over road noise and the car stereo.  I also found myself grabbing my Iphone out of my old mount (not this one) when someone called because the speakerphone failed to provide enough clarity.  We all know how dangerous this is, but sometimes it just has to be done.  And every time I strained to hear TomTom or grabbed for my Iphone, I'd think about how well this mount worked with my Iphone, wishing for a new version.I'm happy, and not surprised to report that the Iphone 4 version works exactly as well as the 3G/S - which is to say it works extremely well.  The speaker's sound is routed through a brilliantly designed chamber behind the phone that manages to *almost* magically enhance the sound to twice its normal volume.  I remember seeing custom speaker boxes built like this, or you may recall seeing the Bose Wave Radio that showcased the same  basic idea.  I don't know the technical details, but the idea is the same.  Small amount of input bounces around in scientifically designed chamber that amplifies it, making it louder.  You get it, right?  Right.  Good enough.And it works beautifully.  Loud, super loud, almost, at full Iphone volume.  I rarely have it up that loud when using the TomTom app, as it sounds obnoxious.  Phone calls sound fine at full volume.  It's just what the Iphone needed - I just wish it amplified the microphone, too, but unfortunately it does not.The Iphone fits just fine in the mount, but it has not been redesigned to suit the Iphone 4.  The only things changed is orientation of the waveguide and the pads the Iphone sits on (they were curved for the 3G/S version.)  I wish Kensington had done a little bit of redesign because they really could have had the 'grip arms' reduced to one thin one that held it at the top, rather than the sides.  Without a case on, the arms tend to cover a bit of the screen, making it difficult to reach the very edge where you might need to reach (such as using the Ipod app's quick-access A-Z bar on the right.) The Iphone also 'hovers' in the mount - it doesn't actually lay against anything, which might be good for those worried about scratches, but worries me for stability since the only thing actually touching the Iphone is the two 1/3' spots at the bottom and the two curved arms.For those curious, I have a 2010 Honda Civic sedan, and I've mounted the Soundwave on the little, nearly useless driver's side sail window.  I've found that to be an excellent position for me as I can glance just off the steering wheel to see what's going on with the app, but it's not great for usage as an Ipod - it takes some serious stretching to reach the Iphone for manuevering around the screen.  Luckily I tend to use a 160gb Ipod for music and the Iphone is strictly for non-music things.",4
"The unit itself is well built, seemed prety sturdy, easy to setup/attach to window, easy to insert phone.  For a holder only, fine.  But I wanted the speaker/amplification option.  found it to sound tinny/hollow. Not worth the money; I returned it.",3
"Kensington went 'old school' and designed a sound baffle inside this well designed car mount.  This baffle is designed to provide a boost in volume, though it's not the best quality amplification in the world.  While the sound is not quality sound, it can make a difference if you need a boost for in your car to help overcome road noises without having to change the settings on your phone.The best part of this system is the mount that swivels so that you can view the screen as you drive.  This is exceptionally helpful when you're using a GPS application.  With a window mount as well as a vent mount, one or the other should help you find your own personal 'sweet spot'.  The phone is securely clipped into the mount and both the window and vent attachments feel quite sturdy.  I also love the fact that you can still access the power and headphone ports on the bottom of the phone while it is in the cradle.  I have an old cassette deck in my truck that I use to access the MP3 player on my phone (via an adapter) so being able to secure my phone in my line of sight without blocking those ports is ideal.",5
"First of all, a disclaimer: I thought this would work with the iPod touch 4th generation model, and while it does hold the iPod firmly, I failed to notice prior to ordering that the iPhone 4 speaker is on the right side, while the iPod touch's speaker is on the left side. The end result is that this does not amplify the speaker of an iPod touch 4G unless you put it in the crade backwards, and even then it's not as good because the iPod touch is thinner and more tapered than the iPhone 4, which means the speaker doesn't sit flush against the cradle.That being said, I did test the car mount's amplifying ability by pressing my iPod touch speaker flush against the speaker-hole on the mount, and it did indeed amplify the sound quite a bit. It sounded a little hollow, so I wouldn't say this is the best choice for music, but for hands-free phone operation this would be a nifty kit, as it doesn't require any power of its own. No wires or batteries are needed to get louder sound out of the speaker.As a mount, I was impressed. The clamps hold your device securely, but without crushing or scraping it. It supports slim cases, too. The vent-mount worked OK, but I couldn't help thinking that in the winter, when I need the heat on in the car, that having an electronic device parked in front of the vent would be a bad idea. The suction cup that attached to the windshield was strong, and it has a locking lever to give suction-- No, you don't need to lick it and stick it up there!  The mount arm was VERY solid, and yet flexible; Quite impressive, actually.And that's really all there is to it. I'm keeping mine, even though I don't have an iPhone and the iPod touch doesn't work as well on it, because even if I just use it as a mount for my iPod, it's worth it. While I don't recommend getting it for an iPod, it's not a total loss for the iPod owner, either. In fact, it's probably the best car mount I've used, whether or not the amplification feature works.For iPhone users, this is a great idea. Save yourself the wires and mess, and let this device amplify your iPhone instead. You'll probably save energy, save time, and save money in the process.UPDATE 12/11: I've been using this cradle for my Android phone in my car, for GPS. While the speaker isn't in the right place to be amplified, I have to say this works great as a cradle. The suction cup has held strong, and the ability to turn the cradle sideways easily is excellent for GPS functions. So my statement about it being a great car mount still stands... Even with Android phones!",4
"For starters, the thing that drew my attention of this product was the volume enhancement it offers. When I received it I was pleased to see that included in the box are two possible mounts for your iPhone, one for the windshield and one more for the car vents.I first tested it with my iPhone 3G and was unable to see any improvement on the volume, then I read the box and noticed this is designed for iPhone 4 users, my bad for not noticing that before. I borrowed a friend's iPhone 4 to make the test and the volume difference was barely noticeable, both inside the car and outside (we wanted to makes rue we were not doing anything wrong)As a mount for the iPhone it woks great, while the plastic of which it is made of may not look expensive, the overall look is pretty good. It is easy to place and while it is a little bumpy when you drive (I am using the windshield mount) it holds well. The iPhone grip is covered with something that looks like rubber so it does not scratch the iPhone; the clips which hold it are adjustable (you can even have a slim case on your iPhone and it will fit in) and easy to use while driving which is a plus.I had originally thought I may have not used it correctly hence I could not perceive a difference in the volume, instructions are pretty straightforward so I was not sure if it was just me. After reading some of the reviews here I can tell many people were unable to notice a volume difference.I can confirm after testing both an iPhone 3G and an iPhone 4 that there is little to no difference in the volume, but as a mount, this worked pretty well.",3
"Love this device - it's super easy to use. The arm clicks together and is easy to attach to the windshield, but since my suv is pretty big, the windshield is pretty far away, so I use the vent attachment, also easy to use.I was excited to get this product from Vine, I had another from Vine that needed a 'fix' for the iphone4. While the 'fix' of a attaching a small piece of sticky-backed foam worked fine, I gave that to my sister for her 3GS when I saw this device.Although it's not a powered unit, it does amplify sound sufficiently for most driving situations, and it costs far less than powered devices.It's also so easy to get the phone in and out of the device, it keeps charging the phone and gives you access to all the ports!",5
"The sound amplification of this item is ingenious and works great.  But it is very hard to get the phone in and out of the restraints...  You can't leave the device attached to the window or the vents with out it being pushed off by the pressure of snapping the phone in.  Even when it is in your hand, it is hard to put in.  This is a major design flaw and keeps me from using this device.  It is worthless and useless because of this design flaw.",1
"This was exactly what I wanted, something to secure the iPhone in a position that I can see it and hear it.  My car is old, my radio is old, and the antenna is mounted on the trunk, so the phone mounting systems that use a radio station to broadcast what the navigation system is saying do not work for my car.  Waste of money for the extra functionality.This system mounts securely to the windshield and to the air vents.  We have 3GS iPhones in Otter cases (New Otter Impact Skin Black Case for Apple iPhone 3G S ) and they fit securely into the system.  We can charge our phones with the charger we had while mounted on the windshield or on the air vents.This system is an excellent buy for the price!!!!!",5
"When I opened the box, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't one sheet of paper, no booklet, no paper work.  A little sticker directs you to go to car1(dot)kensington(dot)com for a visual tutorial.I tried it out.  The sound is only marginally better.  If I just hold the iPhone outside of the case in the same place in my car it pretty much sounds the same.  When I clip it in it maybe sounds slightly louder but it's not obvious.  The suction cup attachment did not work on my car windshield in the cold.  I tried messing with it for a few minutes and gave up.  The attachment for the air vent is pretty convenient.  I like having it there in front of me.  If anything that makes the sound better because its closer to me and a whole lot better than fumbling with it on my lap or the seat next to me.",3
"I have an iphone 4.  My car has bluetooth but no navigation system.  I have a Garmin Nuvi, but using my iphone's navigation is much easier than taking out and booting up the Nuvi.Additional plus is that anytime I get a call, it rings into the car, but I have no idea who's calling.  With the iphone in the cradle, I can see who's calling me.This cradle fits nicely in the vent.  I leave the cradle in all the time, without removing it.  Placing iphone into the cradle is quick.Overall, I would recommend to iphone owners.",5
"Sound amplification without batteries - you must be joking, right ?Thats what I thought when I got this device on Amazon, it must be a fake.  Well, do my surprise, it works pretty well, while it does not blast the sound, it does an amplification to the tune of 15-20% improvement in the overall volume, if you are wanting more than that, you are better off with attaching a Aux input.Now, what else does this device do ?- Fixing to the Car - there are 2 types:(1) Suction mount of windshield - this is awesome, it is solid well made easy to fix for the windshild(2) Car vent mount - this is crap, how did Kensington think of something like this, it is basically a set of prongs that go and fix on to the car vents, it keeps coming off, can potentially DAMAGE your iPhone with the hot & cold air coming our of the ventOverall - I would recommend this device for anyone wanting to install a iPhone car mount desiring sound amplification of upto 20% + a hands free operation and clear view of the screen if you want to use it as a GPS.",4
"I use this device a little differently than it was probably intended, but it works well - I stuck it on a window in my living room and use it as a dock to amplify sound from the speakers when I'm listening to music/news or talking on speaker phone. I have found that though it definitely amplifies the sound, I wouldn't say that it actually doubles it as it claims.The suction is very powerful as long as I'm using it on glass - I have stuck it to a few wooden surfaces and though it will sometimes hold for a few minutes, it always ends up falling. Since I live in Chicago my windows can get very cold, but I haven't noticed any problem with the window temperature affecting the suction strength. It's also very easy to disengage the suction and move the device.I used it in a friend's car just to see how it would do and it definitely improved sound, but the flexible arm caused it to bounce - I wouldn't recommend the windshield mount for use with any GPS device unless you key it in beforehand or make a lot of stops where you can get a good unwavering view of the screen. The vent mount works better for this purpose.The phone sits in there nicely and I didn't see any risk of the phone falling out - but it's also very easy to insert and remove the phone.",4
"After two years and one month of heavy every day use with 4 different devices (LG Optimus S, Samsung Nexus S 4G, Samsung Galaxy S 2, Samsung Galaxy Nexus), it finally broke.  I think $10/year is a good value.  The plastic grippers finally failed at the point where the metallic spring is.  That said, it could still be improved; if the little metal piece on the springs was just a bit longer, maybe out to where the plastic begins to curve, i don't think it would have broken yet.  But like I said, I'm happy with $10/year for a mount that I actually like and use as heavily as I did this one.  I'm ordering another one right now.",5
"I got sick of crappy mounts so I bought three the same day and decided to stop messing around. The kensington mount isn't horrible. The suction cup is big and sticky. I could almost get the phone into the position that I liked. It is sort of shakey when you are on bumpy roads, but I have had worse. My big disappointment with it was that it really chewed up the Apple Bumper that I bought with my iPhone 4. Since this mount appears to be aimed squarely at the iPhone 4 user and the bumper is the official Apple 'case' for the phone. I found that extremely disappointing. I threw it on a shelf. If I sometime replace my bumper with a hard case and need a mount, I may try it again, or give it to someone who needs one. I wouldn't buy it again though.",2
"I bought this awhile back for my iPhone 3G. I eventually sold my iPhone and wanted to remove the vent mount. After some fiddling, the small plastic cracked and a tiny piece is missing so I cannot even glue it back together.The windshield mount is great. The suction cup works very well and it's easy to attach and remove my iPhone.",4
"I got this a couple months ago for free (after rebate).  Was in the market for something like this to hold my iPod Touch in the car so jumped on that deal.  For free, I'd rate this quite highly.  It seems well made, and the suction mount sticks like a champ to my windshield.  I've not yet tried attaching it to my vents so cannot comment on that.  It holds my iPod quite snugly - no fear of it popping it out.  For all of this, I'd certainly give it 5 stars based on the price I paid.  However, the one real limitation on this is that there is no way to pivot it or otherwise adjust the angle.  It would be much better if the arm were flexible, or if it had a ball head that allowed you to somehow rotate your iPod once mounted.  I've not shopped around much, so this might be a problem common to most/all mounts.  Even with that limitation, it is a great product.  I'd rate it 3 1/2 stars if I could.",3
"this is my Third car mount, where I trashed 2 othersafter seeing lot of vibration from them.This item with A/C mount holds absolutely tight & easy to reachmust have item for every iPhone users.very sturdy build & well thought on the design.I love the groove to hold the Charging cable, so that my charging cable is not hangingas with many moving parts..this item must have its own wear & tear.But I am loving this from day-1 I started using this..",5
I was worried how the vent component of this mount would work since the Mazda 3 has vents that move up or down to direct air flow. I didn't want my iPhone angled down and I was worried the view wouldn't be good.I was worried for nothing. The design of the vent component is ingenious and it works well with my Mazda 3 and iPhone 3gs.  The size of the dashboard mount is a good size and fits in my glove compartment. I'm really happy with this purchase...I got it for $10 during the Black Friday craze.,5
"Just wanted to post to anyone looking to buy this mount w/ for an iPhone 4/4S:  It works just fine for me.  I've read a few reports that it doesnt.  Well for me it works just fine.  I liked this mount so much that I bought two for each of my cars.  So on to some specifics:-  For suction mount, i would say its somewhere between a cheapy one you would find at a kiosk in the mall and a RAM mount.  If you have or seen a RAM mount, those suction cups are HUGE.  So this is a good compromise between the cheapy smaller suction mounts and the RAM.  The suction has a lever to clamp down the suction mount.-  The articulation on this mount is pretty good. it has a swiveling mount so you can move the mount horizontally or vertically.  It clicks into place and it works well for me-  The arm is pretty thick and is just bendable enough to make it easy to bend but still rigid enough to keep it from needlessly bending from gravity or a bump.-  for the mount arms themselves, the two arms (or whatever you call it) work well.  The best way to insert your phone is to angle it in about 45 degs and then push the phone into the other side.  this i believe causes the least amount of stress on the arm pivots.  the width allows it to accept other phones too.  my coworker's galaxy s 2 fits just fine as well.  she bought one too after testing mine out.",5
"I've had this product for over 2 years now and I still love it. I use it everyday and works perfect, still, with my iPhone 5s. I like the a/c vent connector. The suction cup mount was too long and in the way. I've had many people ask for the product because it seems to be exactly what they are looking for.",5
"i drive an old chevy pickup that doesn't have anywhere to hold a cell phone. thanks to this product not only do i have a convenient place to put my phone when i'm driving, it also holds the end of my charger cable so i don't have to try  hunting around on the floor for it while i'm going down the road. works great for when i need to travel and use the GPS on my phone. now i'm buying one for my wife :)",5
"this thing is great, my only complain is that, the air-vent adapter can't fit on my car's air-vent but that would be just me, the little hooks are just about a mm. to thick and I could make it work but then may have issues taking it off, but the arm extension works just perfect, so I'm a happy customer. (I have a Corolla '02 just in case people are wondering.)",5
"This car mount for cell phone is just great. I bought 2 of them. The first for a Samsung Galaxy S(tm) II, Epic(tm) 4G Touch, with the cord connection at the bottom and second for a Samsung Epic(tm) 4G that has the cord connection on the top. The mount was easy to install, with no shaking when driving, fit both phones and easy to adjust.",5
"I have had many different types of mounts, but I must say by far this is the best one! Its a universal mount that is not big and bulky, the head still swivels for gps use, and the best thing is the way it connects to the vents for mounting.",5
Versatile solution for your handheld device. Comes with both a suction cup and a AC vent clasp. I use the AC vent clasp and it seems to be universal to most car's air vents. It holds my iPhone 4 and my Galaxy SIII with a case so it fits all sizes of mobile devices. Its locking swivel allows for a wide range of placement and facing and it locks the device securely in place and doesn't budge.overall great product.,5
"Bought this to use in my car's air vent.  It clips on nicely, but can come off quite easily when mounting and unmounting my phone.  It can be quite annoying if you are always on-the-go.  Also, the groove to hold the ipod cable is not thin enough to hole my aux cable, which is what I was hoping it could.  Vibration is pretty minimal when driving, so that is a plus.",3
"I've tried other dashboard mounts for the iPhone and found them sub par, especially the other Kensington mount sold here at AmazonKensington Dash Car Mount for iPhone and iPod, which I tried a total of three times before finally giving it up. That model just didn't last more than a few weeks before the clasp on the holder would just stop working. For a mount that cost as much as that one did, simply unacceptable.However, THIS Kensington dash mount is quite good, so far. I've only been using it for a few days, but can already tell the difference in its quality versus the previous mount. Its simplicity is deceiving (that was my mistake; going for the 'cooler looking' mount); a simple window suction cup and articulating arm make up the bulk of this unit. The clasp that holds the phone in place actually is so much easier to use than my previous mount that required pressing a button in order to dislodge the phone. This really is a 'one hand' job and I've found I don't even need to take my eyes off of the road (which is a good thing, right??:)Thus far I'm highly impressed with this mount. I have a car that's 10yrs old this summer and so it tends to rattle a little (okay, a lot:) at higher speeds. I've gone up to 65MPH and noticed only a slight amount of shuttering using the mount; that's fantastic in my opinion, because I've found nothing more annoying than trying to navigate the iPhone's iPod controls and my finger touching everything BUT what I'm aiming for because the phone shakes too much on a dash mount. I haven't used the vent-mount piece yet (IDK, something about putting a phone near blasting cold air just doesn't seem right) so in all fairness I'll test that one also to ensure my high rating is justified. We'll see if this mount can withstand the test of time.UPDATE 3/9/2012:After almost a year, this dash mount is still going strong. I love it and it's in the same great condition now after 10 months that it was right after installation. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase! (BTW: I did try the vent mount and it works just as well as the dash; still, I don't like like a freezing cold iPhone so I'm not using that piece.",5
"The Car Mount is great! Works very well on my car, the arm is very steady, the quick release hand is very firm, I had my doubts buying this, but there is no need to worry, fits very well on my iphone 4, even with the bumper on.Also the other mount thing for the air conditioner works very well too, nice product, recommended for everyone!Just not as easy to quick release with one hand, but whatever, still love it.",5
"This car mount works fine and does the job properly, it holds your iphone 4, 4S, 5, and 5S wihtout any problem",5
"I clip me phone on and lets go i use it as a gps and and flip my phone to any side i want also i have used it with iphone4-5s and i have not had any problems with it coming apart. it has fell on me twice since i took it off and when i placed it back i did not clean the area first, but i have mine in the car for about 8 months and has not moved or fell and thats with me pulling on it a couple of times to adjust it to my view.",5
"I used this for 2 years with my HTC Evo and currently use it with my Galaxy S3.PROS:*Very secure grip with our without case.*Small profile so it doesn't block your driving vision. I mount it right behind the rearview mirror and the cradle sits right below the mirror.*Suction mount is strong and secure. Hasn't fallen off yet.*Mounting arm is stiff to minimize vibration. Makes it easy to see and use your GPS.*Easy to turn from horizontal to vertical and vice versa.CONS:*Vent mount doesn't work well with my Honda Pilot. Doesn't matter to me since I prefer mounting to the windshield anyway.Overall, this is a compact, versatile mount that can handle a variety of phones.Update Dec 2013: I have since found a better mount in theAmazonBasics Universal Windshield and Dash Mount. See my review there for more details.",5
"I've extremely pleased with this window mount. I originally had a Griffen window mount that I liked, but it was form fit to snap over my older iPhone 3G, and my wife and I soon headed down separate roads when it came to phones, so I wanted a mount that would hold both of our phones. She has an HTC Sensation and I now have the iPhone 4S. This mount works great with both of our phones.I have a bumper on my phone, so I can't comment to whether or not this would work just as well if my phone were bare, since I see there are conflicting reports in other reviews. My hunch is that it would work well, but I'd check through the other reviews first. It certainly works great with my iPhone when it is in the bumper and would work well with pretty much any other case out there. The clamps catch a little too much on my bumper since it is rubbery, so it is easier to put the phone in two-handed, although it is possible to do one-handed, just a little tricky. The mount rotates a full 90 degrees for landscape or portrait view. It isn't a full 360 degree rotation, just 90 degrees, so sometimes you put it landscape when the mount it rotated one way, then when you rotate it to portrait your phone is upside down. But once you get in the habit of rotating only one way and back, this isn't an issue.The suction stays put like it should. I can't recall it coming off by itself. The flexible arm is a nice circular solid material that feels like a rubber coated large gauge aluminum wire. It is a nice feeling and definitely stiff enough. However, you will get some up and down movement if you don't mount it so the flexible arm rests on the dash. So, I've found the best way for me is to line it up on the lower portion of my windshield so the flexible arm comes down, touches my dash, and then comes out towards me. Then I take the mount off the windshield and unbend the arm a little bit so that when it put it back where it was and suction it to my windshield, the flexible arm is in a hard contact with my dash. That way, when you are driving around it doesn't jiggle side to side or up and down.This is a great mount. It is built with a universal design so that it really can accommodate a wide range of phones. If you are looking for something that you won't have to upgrade when you get a new phone, or so you can mount both your and your spouses phone depending on who is using the car, I'd recommend this mount. It's sturdy, functional, versatile, and good looking. The only complaint I have is minor. The clip for the charging cord is useless, at least with iPhone chargers. The charging cable does not snap into the recessed area of the mount as intended. But this doesn't bother me.I hope this review was helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in a comment. Good luck!",5
"I bought this back in 2011 and it has lasted till now. The suction cup gave out as I was removing it to clean my windshield. It worked so well, I'm buying a 2nd one",5
"Its good, It consistently move to where I want it and stays there, this mount is pretty much what I expected.",5
I have read reviews here that say this holder does not work with the iPhone 4S because it doesn't have rounded edges like the iPhone 3GS.  That is not true this holder works perfectly with the iPhone 4S.  Even with or without a case I have tried using this holder both ways.,5
"Excellent quality, easy to put the phone in, and take it out, and provides excellent grip to your phone.It fits my iPhone 4, Samsung Vibrant, and Nokia N900. It might not fit a 4.3' phone like some of the HTC's though, so if you have one of those, try to make sure first, as it barely fits my Vibrant (enwrapped with a thin Amzer case).I like that you can easily rotate the grip portion to switch between portrait and landscape modes.I got it on sale for ten buckaroos, so for that value, this is a 5-star product.",5
"I have a Samsung Google Nexus S 4G phone I use for GPS navigation while drivingI was considering the Samsung OEM model for Nexus S 4G but what if in the future I changed phones and the Samsung holder would not fit since it was made specifically for Nexus S 4 GSo I bought this after market one since if I changed phones to iPhone or HTC Evo , etc this after market one would more likely be compatible and fit itI have no regretsThe Kensington was a snap to use, I had it working in under 1 minuteIt comes with a snap on for use on windshield or air vent, I chose windshield suckerI snapped on the holder to the windshield mount, just slide it in and it sucked to the windshieldAs for fit of my Nexus on the cradle...perfect, the side holders, they are flexible so if I have a different phone width the slide holders will bend to accommodate, more like stretch; I simply slid my Nexus in and it was snug...done. I checked if the car charger can hook to my phone while driving (I bought a separate car charger); it did since the plug for charger is at bottom of Nexus.....everything is awesome...happy driver and now I do not need to lay down the phone or hold it while using it as a GPS...heck it can be a holder for my Nexus while I am on speakerphone too.....recommend recommend recommend recommend!!!",5
"This product was not easy to find. Most of the products out there have fairly bulky rubber pieces on the sides to hold the phone in place and are two to three times the price of this item. This unit has a softish rubbery type of plastic on the inside of the curved tabs that grip the phone quite well. I have not noticed any vertical movement of the phone during a trip. The tabs are spring loaded so they spread out and the phone just clips in under pressure. Because they are only about an inch or so in height, there is no interference with buttons on the sides of the phone and specifically for the Nexus S, they hold the phone in place and allow for perfect access to the power and volume buttons. If you are looking for something that will work for the Nexus S, this is it. The price is also right.",5
"I really like Apple products, but the biggest complaint is the 'Proprietarity' (think I spelled that right) and cost of accessories.  For once, a product that works, is cheap, works better than expected, and is cheaper the 2nd time I purchased it, did I mention it works!  I bought 1 about 2 months ago. Have different vehicles I use, and then after my brother borrowing my cradle for GPS purposes, I decided to just give it to him and get 2 more.  Kensington 'Thank YOU!' for making this inexpensive, functional accessory for the iPhone.The only thing that could make it better is if the cradle either A) was longer at the base of the phone holder with a curviture toward the driver or B) came with a clip on over the phone/case with a curviture toward the driver.  Reason being on speaker phone calls, the speaker is on the bottom of the iPhone, if a person holds their hand under the phone the sound travels toward you intstead of down, allowing you to hear a lot better. But that defeats the purpose of hands-free phone calling. If it had this capability I could remove my need for the bluetooth speaker.  The cradle I use in the office is designed with this feature and has allowed me to just use speaker phone on iPhone.  I do tilt the phone up a bit more than normal to try and compensate for when i don't have my bluetooth speakerphone, it helps, but is not great.The BlueAnt Speaker Phone I have for the iPhone (4) doesn't seem to like connecting and disconnecting after turning the speaker phone off/on upon exiting and re-entering the vehicle (not the case when I used the Samsung Intensity II).  Manual power offs of the Bluetooth in iPhone settings gets old quick.Other than that last bit, again this cradle is perfect, and really love the swivel feature.I cannot comment on the feature that allows one to use the air vent.  Never had much luck with them even with air freshners, but the arm is fully adjustable and I just love it.",5
"I think a lot of reviewers who've said their iPhone 4s don't fit in the cradle are actually reviewing the WRONG model, because this fits my iPhone 4 perfectly (without a case). I slip my case off before putting it in the cradle, simply because it fits the iPhone 4 perfectly with the case off. It WILL go in with the case on, but I'm afraid that it will stretch the plastic & eventually break; so, I like the case being off.I use the vent mount, simply because it's a lot more snug and I don't have to keep placing/removing the windshield mount every time I use it. My phone also doesn't 'bounce' with the vent mount, and I drive a lot of back roads with potholes. The cradle also works better with the vent mount. For some reason, Kensington has the cradle snap into place with the vent mount a lot better than the windshield mount. The Windshield mount doesn't snap it into place, causing it to bounce for people who use that. That's the only con I have.Overall, the product works as advertised. Be aware that the vent mount is a bit difficult to install & remove, but after it's installed it's definitely very convenient for your everyday commute.",4
"WOW!  I love this iPhone Car Mount holder.  It is so nice to be able to charge my phone while in the car and not have it stuck in a cup-holder or sliding around on the seat (or floor)!  Easy to snap my phone in & out and invaluable when I need voice/map directions (faster than my GPS).  Next year, I am going to purchase these as gifts now that I know how much I like mine!",5
This is the best for vent holding but its still not the best quality as it can beak after a yr of use wish they made this design for other phones. I used it for a 3GS then for a 4S then for a Galaxy S II  and work with all so its nice but will not work well with cases or bumpers as it can slip.,5
"This device was difficult to mount on the vent of my 09 Corolla; and Kensington customer service was no help, insisting it was NOT meant for vent mount--despite the vent mount adapter.  Finally mounted it, but the ratcheted (i.e. not smoothly moving) bracket would not stabilize in a vertical position, but only at funny angles.Decided to try the glass mount, which went up easily but same issue of uneven vertical display was evident...then when I switched from a silicone case to a Otter Box Commuter (silicone but outside hard plastic wrap), the bracket NO LONGER HELD the device at all!DONT waste your money--get one with a support bracket on the lower side (with a cord space in the middle).",2
"Mine arrived on time. As soon as I unpacked it and tried to fit my iPhone 3GS in it, I could hear a sound of the side grips cracking.  One chip (piece) fell off, then another and then another:). It was weird. My iPhone has no other cover on it. So I wasn't obviously trying to force fit anything.I have previously purchased a similar product of the same brand through Amazon: K39210US (older model of K39256US) and I am still using it in my other car. I wanted to buy another K39210US for my 2nd car, since I was happy with it (see my review on that). But K39210US shows out of stock, so I ordered K39256US.It was clear to me that the item wasn't damaged during USPS shipment. Either this unit has some general design problem, or it shipped broken out of Amazon warehouse. The item overall looked unreliable to me. So I didn't ask for replacement. This one went back and I will keep my K39210US.",2
"Best $10 I've ever spent on my car. This thing is awesome. I use it with my iPhone 4S, mainly when I use GPS to get me where I'm going. But it also works great when playing music. I no longer have to look at my lap or passenger side seat to change songs on my phone. It's improved the way I drive because I can better keep my eyes on the road. Very stable when placed on the windshield.  Easy to put on, adjust and remove. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if possible mainly because it makes a very subtle noise when I'm driving on bumpier roads. With enough practice you'll be able to operate every aspect of this car mount with one hand. Easy, Inexpensive, and Effective!",5
I bought this charger for my iphone 4 (verizon) and I use my phone with an Incipio case. I love that I can keep my case on my phone and put in my boyfriend's phone (iphon 3gs - at&t w/ a case) and it works for both!! It rotates nicely for gps and the various mounts allow you to put it wherever you want! I wish I had one of these for previous phones I used! But it was worth every penny!,5
"This mount allows you to place the iPhone 4 easily with one hand.  It holds the phone securely enough to allow you attach your docking connector cable with one hand as well...even while driving. The ability to switch to landscape and back to portrait orientation is great. It came with a vent mount and a window mount that uses a strong suction cup device.  I have only used the window mount that has a flexible neck.  The only issue I have is a relatively small one: while driving, the neck allows the mount to shake a bit.  This is not a deal breaker, and I am looking for ways to decrese the shaking.",4
"The mount works very nice.  I was planning to use the A/C vent mount, but it does not fit my 2010 Accord.  I'm currently using the windshield mount, but trying to find an alternate location before the summer when I use my windshield shade from the harsh sun.  I use this in conjunction with an iPhone audio/charge connector (also bought from Amazon) which has a USB (to charge) and 3.5mm connector (for audio).  This cable/mount combination allow me a true quick mount/dismount for a real reasonable price and a much better music sound (direct connect always beats bluetooth or FM).  Additional bonus is I can still use my Plantronic 975 for a far superior call quality (and privacy) since it's not taking up the bluetooth connection.As with any goosenecked mount, it will have a slight 'jitter' while the car is moving.  However, it is one of the few that is solid and sturdy enough for me to be satisfied with.  I'm rating it 4 because they could have designed the vent mount to be more adjustable.",4
"I thought it wouldn't hold the phone properly. I was wrong. This is fully functional, firmly gripping my iPhone. Now I could open the map and drive carefree. I would highly recommend it if you need to look iPhone a lot while driving.",5
"I purchased two of these one of my mazdaspeed 3 and one for my wife's toyota rav4.  The Rav 4 suction cup worked perfectly, mine did not.  It does come also with an adapter to mount to the vent, but that is flimsy and actually broke on me.  The clips works great if you have a 'naked' or unprotected Iphone 4.  It is usable, but not perfect if you have any sort of case.  We use bumper cases and it will work, but is a two handed operation.  Ideally, I would like a one handed operation where I can slip it on and go.I was impressed with the design in that it keeps all my parts accessible, including speakers and microphone.",3
"Use the hook on my family's VW jetta vent and on my Volvo S60. It's not bulky, it's pretty solid and blends in my car. Does not work with bulky iPhone cases, but I don't have a case on my phone so it works great.",5
"And as such, it's a moving target, as T-Mobile has a new G2 coming out (G1 Blaze, HTC Vision, etc.) with a keyboard and 1Ghz CPU.  For now, this is Motorola's official update to the original Droid (which also has a keyboard), and it's a winner.So let's start with the good stuff.  It's very fast, and it has Android 2.2 (Froyo), and supports Flash, and does nice things like synchronize your settings with Google if you so desire.  The keyboard is coated with the same semi-sticky plastic they use on the body, which is a good thing since this is a $600 computer and you don't wanna drop it.  As I've been using Android since 2008, I can say that this device has never given me a 'Force Close' on any application I've run thus far.  Two years in, and this is the best Android device I've used: G1, Garminfone, MyTouch 3G Slide, HTC Incredible, LG Ally are all devices I've used, and only the Incredible would tempt me away.  But, gotta have a keyboard.Internal storage and apps2SD are two huge wins with this device.  If you want to go ahead and store apps on the phone, you'll likely not run out of space.  If you think you might, you can push the app right to your SD card, and it supports 16Gb microSDs.  If you're an iPod user and your iPod holds less than 32Gb, this could replace it easily.There's bad stuff though.  One, this is a Verizon-branded phone, and for some reason, call signal quality is not really very good.  Calls on my block are static-sounding, which is really bizarre given that I live in Essex County, NJ and Verizon has blanketed my area for years.  I hope Verizon hammers this out, as it isn't a good beginning to the experience.Also bad is the usual carrier-specific branding and lock-down: there's no way to go 2G-only to conserve battery life, but you do get a battery-use profile tool that may or may not.  I have it set to max battery but by day's end, I need to recharge this.  With GPS or WiFi, you might get 6 hours of solid use before you worry, 8 and you're done.  The radios just use lots of power.Flash is not supported by default for this phone from Verizon.  I had to manually download it and install it.  It was available, then not, and I don't know who is at fault there (likely VZW).  The root procedure for the Droid 2 is out there, so maybe that's where I will need to go.  But, I shouldn't have to... but that's another bit of trouble, in that Motorola is not HTC.  Motorola is happily locking these down, whereas with the HTC devices, it's more of a token effort.  Openness is a more effective tool for adoption than walled-gardens.The camera works, and the flash is actually fairly effective in dark rooms.  I like it, but for me a camera on a phone is your last-ditch documentary tool.  It'll do the job and capture the moment, but I wouldn't rely on it due to shutter lag.  It isn't the worst but it still doesn't immediately respond, so you'll get a few blurry shots.I waited four months for this phone, and it delivered.  I fully expect VZW to fix my connection issues in some fashion, and the crew at XDA to supply me a custom ROM in the future.  As someone who uses his phone for more than calls, this should last me at least two years before I get the itch go upgrade.-C",5
"Motorola Droid2, A955This review will be primarily focused on the Motorola Droid2, with some commentary on the Verizon service and plan purchasing experience. The Droid2 is essentially the same profile as the original Droid. The main differences are the processor speed, keyboard layout, and support for Mobil 3G hotspots. They also moved the camera slightly, so not all enclosures will fit the same, but according to Motorola the docks (car and multimedia) should all still be compatible. When I bought the Droid2, the DroidX was the most popular Droid. It couldn't sit on the shelf long enough at the local stores, and even Amazon wouldn't have them in stock for another 5-7 weeks at almost twice the price of the Droid2. I didn't have a need for a micro-HDMI port, and I really did want a hardware QWERTY key, so the Droid2 was perfect. Also, Amazon had an excellent price for the Droid2. It was highly competitive and made the local stores appear excessively overpriced. Another win for Amazon!The biggest advantage to the Droid2 over other touchscreen-based phones is the hardware QWERTY keyboard. The keys are '3 dimensional', covered with a type of plastic not unlike that on a microwave oven. You can also opt for the touch-screen based keyboard similar to what you find on an iPhone. My fingers are too big to really use those effectively, and Swype has not been very effective for me. I still type much faster on a full-sized desktop keyboard or a laptop keyboard. It is frustrating for me to send out long emails or frequent emails/Tweets/Facebook posts because it is slower to type on the Droid2 versus a keyboard - but the Droid2 does this very well with the hardware keyboard.The Droid2 doesn't come with many accessories, so you will want to get a holster or case, car charger, and a car mount. The Droid2, like many other modern smartphones, requires a micro-USB charging cable/port. The travel charger that comes with it is nothing more than an AC adapter with a USB port, so you could opt to use a Griffin/Apple (gasp!) USB wall charger that produces around 1A at 5VDC. I looked at a bunch of different cases and holsters and really wanted one similar to the Blackberry holster. Unfortunately, the Droid2 is designed to react to magnets by switching to dock modes that will drain your battery. I ended up buying the Superior holster and  case combo, the one sold at Verizon Wireless Stores and here at Amazon (do a search for MOTDRD2HOC). I purchased the Motorola P513 car rapid charger (don't get the ones at the Verizon store, they are overpriced and poorly made) here at Amazon, along with an Arkon car mount. I did not want to get a car dock because it wasn't as secure as a universal car mount. Note that if you do use a universal 'clamp' car mount, it may inadvertently push down the ringer/media volume and/or camera button! However, the Superior case 'increases' the thickness of the phone so it prevents those buttons from being pushed. Luckily, the Arkon has cut-outs that fits the Droid2 perfectly!In case you're wondering why I have such a fetish for car chargers and car mounts, it's because the Droid2 has outstanding GPS and map/nav app support. One of the reasons why I went with Android is because of its full support of Google Maps (Blackberry has less, Apple has even less support) and free Google navigation. Sprint/Virgin navigation requires a monthly fee, and isn't as good as Google navigation (free). Google Maps is integrated tightly with the rest of the phone, you can track your location via GPS or cell network (GPS was as accurate as 1 foot or 10 meters), click on destinations, search for places (Walmart, gas stations, restaurants), and call them up directly via Google maps. Satellite overlays, traffic overlays, and even My Maps can be overlaid onto Google maps! This is one of the reasons why Android's market share is slowly growing and causing Blackberry, iPhone, and Windows mobile users to adopt Android - there is a lot of support for Google apps and it is done exceptionally well. You are not a slave to iTunes software or any software, Google is mainly cloud computing. A note to the wise, the latest Google Maps appears to cause issues with hanging/freezing. Just don't update and wait for Google to fix it. The pre-installed Google maps will work just fine.Your contacts are stored in your Google/Gmail account, so if you modify your contacts on Gmail, it will automatically sync on your phone. The Droid2 also combines your contacts from Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter into your contact list - so if a buddy on FB listed his phone number and email, it will show up in your address book as a linked profile. A Gmail/Google account is really a must when using any Android phone.The 3G speeds vary based on time and location. I normally get 0.5 Mbps up/down, but I have gotten up to 2 Mbps downstream. With WiFi, I am closer to 40 Mbps downstream (802.11n). The battery life isn't that great for the first few weeks because the battery life is just an estimate of the life. Once you practically discharge it a few times, it will have a more accurate estimate. So far, with only 3G and GPS on, I can get up to about 3 days of usage without having to charge the battery. I can get more if I don't use the phone obviously. GPS is only used when an app calls for it (Browser, maps, Weather widget). The menu performance isn't as fast as I'd like, and it gets worse with more widgets and Live Wallpapers.I could go on and on about the features of Android 2.2, but you're probably more anxious to read about the phone. The screen is smaller than the DroidX, but at the same resolution. I didn't have a hard time reading small fonts, and photographs showed up crisp. YouTube plays fine, although the resolution isn't that great. The speaker in the back of the phone isn't garbage, but it isn't going to replace my 5.1 system on the gaming PC if you know what I mean. The standard equipped music player causes the phone to freeze/hang up for some reason. No one has really found a fix for it yet. I don't mind because I don't listen to MP3s on my phone. Pandora, however, works fine!Call quality is great, it is much better than Sprint, and I've always felt that Verizon's audio quality was a bit better than AT&T.; Verizon's customer service is very helpful. I ordered my phone via Amazon and once it ships, the phone is 'Activated' and you're charged for usage from that moment. I called up Amazon and explained this, and they agree to credit my usage fees up to the day I receive the phone and activate it. I also have a military discount which required me to supply my email address for them to send me a link, and apply it to the phone number. You could also bring your CAC card to a local store, but some stores demand to see your LES with the SSN blacked out. Also note that if you deactivate your phone within 3 days of activation, you will be waived the activation fee. This is hard to do when you order the phone online at Amazon because it takes around 2-3 days to arrive! If you cancel your service within 30 days of activation, the $350 early termination fee is waived.If you're like me and rarely use the phone to talk on peak hours, get the 450 minute plan. The unlimited data plan is very useful because with very very light usage, and occasionally using Pandora, I am at about 500 MB of usage within 1 week. A colleague of mine was adamant that 80% of iPhone/AT&T; users only use less than 200 MB of bandwidth each month, yet she was in the same boat as me. AT&T; did not have as many Android phones because they're more in bed with Research in Motion and Apple. Verizon and Sprint have a wider choice of Android phones, like the HTC EVO 4G at Sprint or the new Samsung Galaxy 9000 at Verizon (Fascinate is what they're calling it).I am new to cell phones, so the following might be standard fare for the hardcore phone users with 10-15 years of contracts with the big telecom giants. An activation fee is charged for new lines, and you are charged a month in advance along with usage fees from the moment the phone is activated up to the first billing cycle date. So it is not uncommon for the first bill to be about 2-3 times the standard monthly rate. You can download a My Verizon app that helps you track this, or just log on to their website and keep an eye on things.Pros for service: Excellent coverage in CONUS and in Hawaii, decent voice/data planPros for Droid2: Very powerful phone - excellent integration with Google apps, QWERTY hardware keyboard is a major plusCons for service: Could be less expensive, perhaps offer a cheaper voice plan for those that just want data features?Cons for Droid2: short battery life, not much of a change over Droid1, some feel it is too bulky (I think it is sized perfectly), a tad slow, and I have to push this tiny rinky dink button to make it come out of sleep mode or to go into sleep mode.Overall: 4/5 stars.",4
"i have used many pieces of technology and this is easily the most impressive ive ever owned.first pros vs cons:pros:-incredible amount of features and free apps-EASY to be social on the go. has facebook, aim, msn, icq.....other apps for free-the keyboard is slightly easy to use compared to the touch screen-screen looks nice after long use-very entertaining. has many google apps that you can find on the computer and cool 3d games and art programs. seriously you will never be bored with this-the multitasking is awesome but quite impractical. its nice to save where you are and listen to music while you control other apps but its annoying to switch back and forth, needs a new design.-web browsing is quick. changing apps is fairly quick after the first time you launch it-if you wipe phone you can put the contacts back on through an appcons:-the camera is pretty darn terrible. they are similar quality to my 2MP camera on my ENv2 phone but larger. another camera problem is that it makes noises like crazy. you can look up a solution to this on google but when you buy it, theres a corny LOUD sound for both the focusing of the camera and the shooting of the camera. i read that it was for some pervert laws so ppl cant shoot up skirts? seems ridiculous for many reasons-the phone is really noisy. additional to the camera sounds, it makes noises when it auto turns off to save power and when you turn it on.-the actual notifications for texts and email are very lame. i was expecting a text message when i synced my phone with gmail and all it did was make a barely noticable sound and on the top corner had a little icon. it didnt pop up on the screen like most normal phones would-the battery life is HORRIBLE. i think it also gets hot. i bought the phone from the store and it had 60% left. i used to for 2 hours checking out everything and it ran out of batteries. perhaps in a practical day (such as casual usage) it would last longer but that was pathetic.-the keyboard top row is hard to hit correctly because its so close to the sliding part. you will hit it every time you want to use the top row-the iphone i believe has better apps. there is an app called 'word lens' which translates signs into other languages in real time without internet access. the android has an app called 'google goggles' which does it but you have to be online and it isnt close to real time.-many apps 'force quit' or freeze where you cant use them. i have to remove the battery because the phone totally froze during one startup.-there is bloat ware that you cant take off, so your app list is going to be filled with a bunch of crap that you wont use and cant remove which is quite bad since you use the app list so much.-this phone was advertised saying 'can see the web the way its meant to be' and yet, it has simplified versions of some websites such as youtube and facebook. youtube is missing some videos similar to how it does when you are on your wii or ps3.-takes a long time to charge and while charging(via usb) you cant see your music videos or photos-theres a feature that allows the screen to turn when you tilt the phone. sometimes it randomly doesnt work after a while for unknown reasons and you are forced into one view.-out of the box it had glitches where i couldnt sync my gmail account to it correctly so i had to wipe all my data from the phone and do it againi cant stress how bad the camera is. the 'app' for the camera is also bad. it had different settings that are a hassle to use. theres different modes like 'auto' and 'close up' that normal cameras have, but you are expected to change that for every situation. even worse is that only 'auto' mode allows you to manually turn on or off the flash. kinda ironic. if you have a lot of light, like right under a bright lamp, the photos are alright, but in low light situations the pictures will be grainy and almost no detail. many photos i take are blurred even though i hold the camera as still as possible. there is a 'anti blur' mode on the phone but do you really want to keep switching to that.another thing to consider about the camera, and how bad it is, is the flash on it. if you are taking a portrait of someone 1-2 feet away, the flash will literally make them see spots or make them close their eyes. this is incredibly bright and i have seen stories of people having to put take over the flash to make it not so violent. its defiantly brighter than a point and click flash. when using the flash you will not be encouraged to use the camera from all the complaints. i just bought this for 300 im not going to put some sticky tape on it to fix its design flaw.i tried to do 720p video through many of the video player apps on the android market, but none of them could handle it, and strangely, they all had different results. not to mention that the phone doesnt actually come with a video playing app, you just file it in the files and click on it and hope it works (but probably wont). when i tried to play the 720p video it basically tried as hard as it could on high quality but the sound was off by about 4 seconds. i tried switching to 'speed over quality' mode and the video is pixely and unplayable. i have seen 'hd' videos on the youtube app though, but i believe they are in 480p resolution.i need a physical keyboard since the touch screen is so small. REALISTICALLY, if you are looking for a droid phone, the only two phones you should be looking at is the droid x and the droid 2. the droid x is HUGE and may not fit in your pocket, but it has a vastly superior camera and supports 720p video. it also has no physical keyboard. really if the droid x had a physical keyboard id just get that but i bought this for the keyboard. if you arent thinking of using the camera a lot, the droid 2 is very nice. incredible speed, social networking and organization are the highlights of this phone.",4
"I guess if you look at my profile I did a review of the LG Ally of which I'm selling.  I loved that phone but at the time I did not know the potental of the droids.  Well the LG Ally  was too slow and was not reconizing my voice for the dialing so I got the DROID  before contract was up. Yes i shelled out bucks but I got a great deal on another site.  funny thing is 4g is right around the corner but I had to get out of that phone !!  So in 10 month I'll have 4gI love this phone.  The Camera is quick and takes awsum pictures, The sound quality and reception is really really Great !! The Games play super fast The keyboard is not quite as good as the LG Ally but you konw what I got used to it.  At first it was a deal breaker but as I got used to it I like it.  But Since the voice  recognition is so so good I don't even have to use the keyboard that much. As you type it also guesses the word you are trying to type so that helps and it also has swipe whoever is cordinated enough to use it.Speaker on it is great. So talking on speaker phone is good.  voice calls are good.  Before I brought it I tested the sound quality on my answering machine and the sound quality comming from that phone is awsum.  . The internet is good but I'd rather use my home computer for that with comcast. But then again if you around a router indoors you can get the same speed. This phone does have the N Standard also.  When 4 G comes around then let me comment about internet without the help of an indoor router. if you go on Facebook or aim, read the news or look up a price it's fast enough on verizons network. I do also play online simple games like connect 4 and it's great and thats on Verizons network so I have no complaints.The GPS is really good also. I sometimes forget about my Garmin and use this.  In fact I don't even have to type in anything all I say is an address or a store and it takes me there. it's mind boggling.The screen is big enough.  No it's not a droid X but it's clearer than one.  I really like the samsung Facsinite screen but the no keyboard was a deal breaker.  To be perfectly honest this screen is really really good and looks more natural then the fascinate.  This is comming from a guy who Returned 3 sony 1080P TV's because of light bleed and got a 720P Pioneer TV because the video processor beat out the 1080P set's.  Why you may ask I didn't get 1080P I didn't have $5000.00 + to spend on the TV.  So yes the Screen is good quality on this phone.As far as the Negitive points on this phoneI'm a complainer and I truthfully don't have anything to complain about substantialMaybe 3 things to complain about1. if you want to get to the memory you have to take out the battery2. the volume button on the headset is not easy to adjust since it's on the same side of my good ear but the buttons are not shaped correctly either.3. Battery life is short but thats to be expected on all DroidI definitly recomend this phone to anyone but listen the 4G is comming out Wait for that one.  But if you must get out of your phone because all you want to do with it is smash it on the floor and spit on it get this phone. The prices are comming down.  and it's really a good phone.  If it was back in it's hay day I'd say run and get it. If you must have HDMI and High Def and a bigger screen go with the X.Just to make people aware the Droid 2 World phone is comming out around the holidays and that has a 1.2 processor vs 1 GIg processor (not sure about the memory but I think it's the same)this phone has the  Same screen, same fuctions But world phone one will be able to operate around the world it has a sim card.  Again it's almsost the same phone so I'd recomend this one the new one.",5
"Received two Motorola Droid 2 phones from Amazon because they had, by far, the best price. We were about to get them directly from Verizon, but when we saw them here, we ordered them. Despite a brief hiccup in the authorization/shipping area which caused the phones to arrive a few days late, they arrived all shiny and new, and with batteries fairly well charged. We topped them off just in case, then began the set up process to use the phones. It was fast and painless, and enabled us to transfer all of our email accounts. We are both first time smartphone users, and reading our emails on the phones is FABULOUS, especially on these phones! And trust me, having a real (Qwerty) keyboard makes all the difference. Yes, I know a phone can be slightly thinner with only a virtual keyboard, but typing is night and day. We actually can be productive with these phones. They come loaded with many apps, including the all important Microsoft Office (mobile edition), and we can edit Word docs, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. It is as if we suddenly moved from the 20th century to the 21st century.We also switched over from ATT to Verizon, and this has been night and day. No more dropped calls, no more digital breakup, and all of our data is delivered quickly! So congrats to Motorola for making a FABULOUS phone, and congrats to Verizon for having excellent service. And a final congrats to Amazon.com for working through a small problem and not only making things right, but going above and beyond to help a customer.Highly, highly recommended!!!",5
"I mean, batman has itSuper heroes wear itand a lot of stuff is made from itBut c'mon, too thick doesn't do the trick.Man, this thing adds so much more thickness to the phone.  I'd rather have it really thin to just have friction to grab it.  The excess thickness might help if it gets dropped from a foot or two, but I don't think it'll help all too much on a normal fall.  Rather get a holster or something.",2
"This is a Great Case, fits like a glove and is very soft and smooth to the touch, get it, you'll be happy with the look.",5
Not correct size for Bold 9650. Can't plug in data cable/charger without cutting hole bigger.  Ended up getting one at Verizon..  When comparing side by side a big quality difference too...the Verizon one is a perfect fit and also better silicone that doesn't slide when on my console in car..stickier rubber.,1
is functinal does what it should do. GOOD VALUE for the money.  I still use on my backup blackberry (I have a smart phone but wish they would get it toghether:) ..  It worked/s well and arrived on time.,4
"I like the feel and function of the silicone case.  it offers protection to the blackberry, prevents it from sliding on smooth surfaces and was priced well.",4
"I know, it is just a battery.  But at $3.50, it is the best $3.50 I've spent on mobile technology lately because it breathed new life into my dying phone.  I can now go a whole day again without a charge.The seller did fine, too.  No muss, no fuss.",5
I have been looking everywhere for a replacement battery for my phone.  I also needed it to be affordable.  This was both!  Great find and I'm eternally grateful to this seller!,5
This supposedly new battery lasts half as long as my year old battery. I suspect that these are either recycled or defective batteries.,1
I bought a couple of these because I was spectacle due to the price.I now have two great batteries that work as advertised.  For the price you cant go wrong I can now make it through the day on a single charge again.,5
love this item. helps to have a backup plan. great price and easy to deal with vendor. will use again.,5
I couldn't believe how inexpensive an OEM battery was for the Pre. This definitely helps to have around when traveling thanks to the Pre's sad battery life. Works perfectly.,5
"The palm pixi isnt exactly a new phone, i use mine as a back up in case i break my new one. Recently i had to used it and the battery holds a great charge!",5
"The product is what's advertised.  I can tell no difference between it and the battery that came with my phone.  That said, I rarely use it because I have learned to stay close to my wired phone charger at all times because this phone runs out of juice so quickly.",5
"I purchased this battery from Slick Zone, a Fulfillment by Amazon seller, to fit aPalm Centrocell phone. I saw several batteries on Amazon's web site, and this one was listed as being manufactured by Palm.I got the exact same genuine Palm brand battery that came with the phone. This is one of the newer batteries with the word 'palm' all by itself in white letters on a black label, not one of the older batteries with black letters on a white label.The battery came in OEM packaging, which is just a clear plastic bag: no blister pack or box. This battery charges just like the original, and lasts just as long. But I paid about the same or less as a knock-off brand battery. Five starts because the battery is the Palm original brand at an outstanding price.",5
"I love my Palm Pixi Plus! I will ride with this phone until it explodes or there are no accessories available. Amazon so far has been my go-to for all of my accessories and keeps my phone going.This battery is a replacement for the last, keeps its charge and fits perfectly. I highly recommend.",5
"Now my phone holds a charge for the entire day. I think this is a genuine Palm battery. If not, it works just like one.",5
The battery arrived sooner than expected and in new packaging. The battery charged quickly and it held a charge for a long time. This is a good product and it helps to have an extra battery on hand.,5
OEM batteries are good.Don't need to change battery out to get more time sinceI almost never use unit as a phone.Nice to have extra when needed or when original goesbad/used up.,5
"I actually bought this battery for no reason, lol. My phone wouldn't hold a charge so I thought I needed a new battery. I found out later that my phone was screwed up. Once I replaced my phone I decided to use this new battery and it has proven to be much better than the one the phone came with. Battery last a whole lot longer and i'm a heavy internet and text user. I like it and I highly recommend it.",5
I can make it through the day again with my Pre. It's as good as the battery that it came with.,5
"Works just like the original. I use it in Palm Pre+. Get a few at this good price, especially because it is probably out of production.",5
"This product worked ok, It only lasted about 3 months before I had to replace it.  I usually get 6 months out of them.",3
"I was skeptical buying these because they were only a buck a piece but figured that if they suck, I'm only out a buck. well I have been blown away by their durability. My sister paid the manufacturer $20 for a screen guard that has already been replaced. This is an excellent value, I ordered another for my wife. Fits my Galaxy S perfect, goes on easy and disappears. best part is there is NO lag time from the film.",5
I bought two of these for both of my samsung vibrants.  I've had many smart phones over the years and have used many screen protectors.  This one  by far was the worse.  The process of putting it on is over the top.  You have to utilize water which I didn't like doing considering I was applying water to a $500 phone.  The water made it hard to put the screen protector on the steady it and eventually I just threw it away.,1
This is a great hard case. I purchased for my husband and it is so easy to grip so less chance of drops.,5
"Well it works, its a thick screen protector and really noticeable. But I'd rather have a big ugly screen protector on the phone, than a big ugly SCRATCH.",4
Works great! Easy to install and did a great job protecting the glass and phone back!  Buy some for yourself!,5
I thought this was going to suck because of the price..but i was SUPER WRONG. This thins is semi-thick but non-obstructive to the touch functions of the samsung vibrant. kinda hard to put on...i say kinda lightly..not if you pay attention and take your time..trust me it will be worth it.,5
Great Screen Protector -- almost invisible unlike others that I have purchased.  I have purchased others that show the fingerprints and give more of a 'shine.',5
This is not a usual screen protector. It has a very thin profile and is extremely flexible. Installation is easy. But it does not provide the necessary protection for the screen. It doesnt look perfect either.Please use a regular screen protector.,1
They should give you much more than one screen saver and it was a little off on the screen measurements.was hard to get on with out lint and dust sticking to bottom side. I'm using it now but don't know if I'll get another one.,3
"For the money spent,this isnt that bad a screen guard.It does take a few shots to get it on without too many bubbles, but thats why you should buy more than one(easy to do at the cheep price). It does offer ok protection,and dosent seem to cause your finger to 'drag' on the screen like most of its counterparts do. Again,its hard to complain with how how cheep they are to buy.Are there better out there? Of course! Are they as cheep price wise? Heck no! Buy it if you want a strong protector without breaking the bank.",4
"The screen protector works good. It smoothes out after the third day of having it on and doesn't peel off, unless you remove it completely.",4
"Installation is easy, just follow the directions.  It takes 10 minutes top from prep to finish.  I would buy it again.",4
very cheap but make my phone clear and easy to be clear .can't think one cron of it .you need one,2
"This product was affordable and easy to use. Every phone should have and Anti glare screen protector on them, always.",5
I purchased these for a great price. The Verizon store wanted to charge me 14.99 for 3 iphone screen protectors and I bought 6 of them from the seller for about $5 bucks total. This was a great deal.,5
"These were pretty good i mean what else can you say. I guess they were pretty and you get all six, its nice",5
"They're awesome!  They're super cheap, but are perfect for your iPhone.  This saves me a bunch of money and allows me to change them more frequently!",5
"Good price, great value.  They are always a pain in the butt to put on, but these weren't too bad.",5
"Got these for the kids phones, but i lost them. the one we used worked now i just need to find them",5
I like it.  They however can not  (at least I can not) put them on without having an air bubbles.,4
"I was able to put the screen protector on without any problems, but when I put my case on I got some air in the corners of the phone, but I guess it's just my case and not the screen protector. I like that its anti glare, it also reduces the amount of finger prints. Over all good product and you get 6 of them for a low price! Shipping was fast too",4
"Perfectly functional screen for the insanely cheap price and it really does the job!I was looking for a cheap screen to put on my iPhone 4G. I didn't need some fancy, expensive InvisibleShield screen, since I never put my iPhone in the same pouch as my keys or anything sharp. I just needed something to put over my iPhone screen so that when I slid it in and out of my pocket, it wouldn't get scratched by sharp particles of dust, or anything.This screen was just what I needed! Plus, the fact that you get 6 of them is even better. (I figured I would mess up a few times.)Application was very easy (considering that I did it very haphazardly and without much thought, that's saying something) and once I got it on properly, the screen protector was seamless against the iPhone screen! It's as if it's not even there!Great product for its price.",5
perfect item not easy to get on without bubbles just have to take time de recommend to protect your screen,5
"When comparing these screen protectors to other ones on the market, there are far more superior ones out there.  This screen protector was difficult to apply, did not remain on the phone long before bubbles appeared around the edges, and lessened the crispness of the images on the screen.  I applied two or three before getting the look that I wanted (ie. no bubbles).I would not recommend this product to anyone expecting this to look great for a long period of time, but it makes for a cheap, quick fix until you can make up your mind on which good-quality one you really want to purchase.  This is one of those times that you get what you pay for here.",2
I broke my phone a few months back and have procrastinated replacing it. I ordered these as a temporary fix to cover the broken glass and make the phone useable. They stuck on great...no air bubbles...,5
These worked pretty well for my phone. They tend to scratch a little easier than the brand name screen protectors. But for the price and amount you get it's pretty nice.,3
Came with a lot of screen protectors but they are very cheap and scratch easily...would not recommend to a friend.,2
"These r not anti glare screenprotectors period! They r just the reg clear screen protectors. They r good to ha e as back up but if u want anti glad protectors get the 'HALO ANTI-GLARE SCREEN PROTECTORS' the best!!!!!! I love them. They come with 3, but u can see, feel, and ezperience the quality. I'll give these a 2 because they lied. If they would have said 6 reusable clear screen protectors than I would have rated these a 5!",2
there really isnt much to say. its perfect.nothing bad at all . good . great . amazing . yes yes,5
The anti-glare on these screen protectors is great for anyone who has difficulty focusing. You don't have to move your phone around to reduce the glare anymore. They don't stick perfectly (some bubbles and lose edge) but they stay on very well and are reusable.,5
"Bought these for my new iPhone to avoid scratches on the screen - only thing you have to watch on installation is to ensure screen is completely clean and free of any lint....  otherwise, installs easy with no bubbles.  very clear screen protector - don't even notice its there.",5
"No bubbles, cheap cost, great product.  Still on my first one after 3 months about with no bubbles.  Just scratches because it's doing what I wanted it to do... Protect.",5
I would definitely buy these again. Much cheaper than the ones in the AT&T store and same quality. Highly recommend.,5
Applying them takes some practice.  I love the anti-glare feature.  All that have an iPhone and see mine want this!,5
"once again, I got what I paid for, not alwys wise to buy cheapley, these were the worst things ever to be made :(",1
Protects screen great. Make sure you line it up to the T though. Any deviation from how it should lay will make it bubble. Easy to put on and still makes screen look good. Matte finish.,5
"YES,,,IT IS SO CHEAP WITH SUCH. A REASONABLE PRICE..GREAT.TOTALLY WILL RECOMMEND TO MY .FRIENDS..WELL..NO MORE WORDS TO SAY..THAT IS IT..",5
"Anti-Glare, I don't think there is a true way to fully prevent it - though you can't beat the value of this pack!",4
great i love it so much it provides so much protection than you so much for the great product kejf;WJEBFkjwebf;&#62;KWEJFB ?ALEjfnb?efjb?efjb?AEFJKB,5
The screen protectors scratch very easily but for the price im not gonna complain much. protects my phone screen as desired.,3
"To start, these are inexpensive screen protectors so don't expect professional results. I have given 4 stars because they are what they are and I did not expect anything more. I simply needed some extras.The protector has a matte finish and a bit of a rough feel - some have described it similar to sandpaper, but I think that is a relative term and a slight exaggeration. It has, however, repelled fingerprints well. When you run your finger over it, it makes a faint noise similar to running your finger over a piece of paper. Some may not like this, but it doesn't bother me. You will experience some blurring around the edges of icons and such, but I consider it negligible. Touch response has not suffered in my experience.Application is a little tricky. Read through this, but know it will make more sense in the moment.The protector comes in three layers: two peel-off coverings labeled by pull tabs marked '1' and '2' and the third layer in the middle being the protector itself. One tab exposes the side that will be placed onto the phone screen and the other exposes the side that you will touch. The directions indicate to remove the layer that exposes the side to the phone screen, place onto the phone and smooth out, then remove the layer that exposes the &#34;touching&#34; side. If you aren't careful, you can pull the protector off the phone when you try to remove the layer for the &#34;touching&#34; side, thus exposing the screen to dust and more bubbles.  Your finished result will most likely be bubbly and unusable.I prefer to remove the layer for the touching side first, clean the phone screen, then remove the phone screen layer, apply quickly, then smooth out bubbles. Inevitably you will get some dust trapped in and have a few bubble spots, but they should be minor. Don't use a credit card or anything abrasive to remove bubbles - you will make marks on the protector. A softer piece of plastic works better (think a key ring card - cvs card, kroger plus, etc).",4
"I bought these for my boyfriend. I know some reviews complain about bubbles. Any screen protector you purchase will have those issues. It is possible to put this on with out any bubbles. I have done it for several people. The screen must be very clean to order to eliminate air bubbles. Overall, it protects the screen and when placed properly looks good. Great price.",4
I love how I can look at my phone & it's doesn't shine in my face. These screens are AWESOME!!,5
"def does work anti glare is perfect for outside but the screen protector seems to have a slight blur effect on the iphone screen kinda takes away from the iPhone screen's brilliant display also has a weird feel to the screen now, but again for the price its not that bad",3
"When I ordered these screen protectors, I had no idea this wasn't needed with the OtterBox since the case had a clear protective case. Because I purchased them, I went ahead and used it. I like the 'anti-glare' part.Right off, I'm going to say that I'm glad more than one arrived. The first one didn't work out well. One of the tabs tore off without the plastic coating part. Let me back up. Each protector comes with two tabs. The first one is to be peeled off and placed on the iPhone's screen. The second tab is used for the other side, to peel off the clear cover. Without those tabs, good luck in getting the protective cover off to place it on your iPhone.There was bubbling, but I was able to press those out with my thumb. All-in-all, I'm very pleased. The price was $1.52 for six and shipping was free. I don't see how you can beat that.",5
I go through a one of these every couple months. I Love changing cases but sometimes it is hell on a screen protector. This is a great deal and plenty to last for a bit!,4
"This product was pretty good. The did get scratched pretty easily, but other than that, still protected my phone well.",4
shipped fast. these are grainy looking on my phone. keeps it protected but makes my phone look funky. id buy more tho. thnaks,4
"They are so inexpensive compared to what you pay in most retail stores, yet you get three times as many. They work very well at protecting your screen. Overall a great product for the price.",5
I got all six but the only thing I can't stand is that it's cloudy so I ended up throwing them out,2
This is a great item and I would definitely recommend this.  These help keep the screen free of scratches so the phone has good service.,5
"exactly what I need for my phone and at the best price possible. easy to put on and I haven't had to change it yet, it has been about 4 months.",5
"clean clear, easy to install phone well protected. sticky stuff is sticky, must make sure screen is very clean before installing.",1
I bought this pack for my cousins and they love it. Good quality and good quantity for its price. Recommend,5
"I'm sure that I'm not a total idiot when attempting to apply these shields, since I was more than able to apply one to my Itouch as well as my husband's Iphone 3G.However, when it came to using this product, I found that even after I had conquered placing it properly on the face of my Iphone, the amount of bubbles was more than I had ever encountered before and were impossible to get out.If anything, it convinced me to go out and get an Otterbox Defender cover for my Iphone which comes with an attached shield that works perfectly.I do not in any way fault the seller.  It arrived quickly and in appropriate packaging.",3
love it fits phone good,5
Its either the camera does fit and the home button or it either the home button fits and not the camera.,2
These are amazing. I bough these for under a dollar and I got 6 of them. I like these way better than the regular clear screen covers,5
i liked this screen protector it helped specially the anti glare..although i dont know may be its just me but it made my phone less sensitive,4
"First, nowhere on the post does it state it's coming from out of country (which would have deterred my buying it) it took over 2 weeks to get because it came from Kowloon Hong Kong, per the packaging label. Second, It does not fit exactly to the screen size of the Iphone 4. It's about 1/16' short of the screen edge. It's better to spend a few bucks more to get a better quality product.  Not worth the time that I waited for it to arrive.",3
"This product does not fit, you will end up with air bubbles on the edges no matter how well you believe you applied the product. Tried three different ones then got pissed and ordered some halo ones that work great.",2
"Love these, especially for the price. I'd defintely recommend, they've lasted me a long time, over a year actually and they're great.",5
"The screen protector did what it was meant to do. The price was great, and it came promptly. Nothing fancy.",5
"These screen protectors have a good 'feel' as they have not made using the touchscreen more difficult.  They feel like a good quality screen protector and may even be re-usable.  The clarity is very good.  The sizing and cutouts are perfectly placed and aligned.  Getting 6 of these at this price was a great deal, and may have been a bit of overkill, but I did just find out that my daughter and her bf just got 4S's, so there's some stocking stuffers. :-)",5
"Fast shipping, easy to apply, great product. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good cheap screen protector",5
Once you put it on..its on!!!Hard to get off so be careful...Other than that it had good protection,5
The protectors scratch really easily. I used a credit card to get bubbles out and that scratched it! Glad I only paid 1 and change for it. Not worth any more than that.,1
"Was not very effective.  Too many air bubbles during installation, and it smudged too much in use.  I would not recommend this product.",2
Very inexpensive necessity for your precious iPhone screen. Very clear and protects from scratches.  Nice to have I stock just in case the one you have wears out.,4
"These are easy to apply, are staying in place and were cost effective.  Some instructions might have helped, but were not 100% needed.",4
"I didn't actually need the anti-glare part of this item, I just wanted to make my iPhone screen more scratch resistant after my old screen protector got scratched and dirty.  This seems to work for that.  I also appreciate the screen cleaning cloths that this item comes with.  As for the anti-glare, it's hard to tell if this works or not, since weather has been rainy and cloudy for the last few weeks, and I haven't been able to expose it to bright, direct sunlight.What's kinda nice is that the screen is matte (not glossy like most screen protectors) which gives it an interesting texture that feels really nice to touch.  The downside of this matte screen is that, like all matte screens, it diffuses light through the screen protector which makes the screen look kinda sparkly as if small randomly-colored pixels were turned on.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, google matte vs glossy screens.  This protector also makes the screen a little darker.The main problem is the bubbles.  I've applied several different screen protectors to my iPhone 3G and iPhone 4 and all of them have bubbles, but the others only had one or two after a few weeks of me pushing them to the side.  Maybe I applied it wrong, maybe it's the case, or maybe I didn't clean the screen enough first, but I have lots (like 11) of bubbles around the edge of my screen, plus one long 'bubble' on one side of my screen.  I think it's probably due to this particular screen protector and that's why it only gets 4 stars.  If I manage to get 2 bubbles or less next time, I'll bump this review up to five.",5
these are good cut right and last long. get this its great for the price. no resadue left on the screen,5
I love these screens I got them cuz I only had otterboxes on my phone overall I will order these again,5
"Now that i replace, the protector of my iphone, i do not have to by another iphone or get a new contract",2
"The people reviewing these that say they are great have never used a good iPhone screen protector. I have bought TONS of screen protectors for 5 different iPods (touch) and 3 different iPhones. These are terrible. The material they use just plain bites, and makes it feel like you are dragging your finger through soft, sticky plastic. You lose that silky feeling you normally have on the iPhone screen. There are many other brands out there that still provide that smooth as silk feeling while still protecting your screen. Halo is one brand that do these quite well among others. So don't be drawn in like I did with, 'Ooh! there are 6 in this pack!'Thankfully these are cheap so I didn't mind throwing them in the trash and then ordering a couple of 3 packs of the Halo branded ones.",2
"they work pretty good, like the way they save the screen from getting scratches on it. Saves a lot of time",5
good protectors!!! cheap and worth buying rather than spending $15 on one get more for even cheaper and they all work the same,5
"This is a nice product and a good price. It requires careful installation but once done, it is great! Well worth my buck and I get extras!",4
"Like any other screen protector, it protects your screen fairly well. A good thing to note it comes with 6 so when one is all scratched up you can change it easily.",4
"These screen protectors were very cheap and had to be replaced every few months, but for the price that was fine.  However I ended up going for the $30 military grade screen protector with the lifetime replacement guarantee.  I will not be going back to cheaper screen protectors.",2
They didn't come as fast as I needed them but.. They are awesome I would really get these I've only used one and love them,5
"it is a good product, but it is a lil difficult to put on the phone, so I had to ask some one else to put it for me!",3
the quality for reuse is not there there is a better one at the apple store that helps with less finger prints and is better,1
"Prepare to enter a NASA clean room to get these things on without any dust or debris traped in there. They are a hassle to get on correctly but that is just the nature of the beast, not unique to this brand. Everything lines up well enough and it comes with 6 protectors so if you royally screw it up you can just toss it and open another one. Screen protectors are inherently annoying and some edge parts will lift up but it is what it is and anyway, it's cheap.",3
This was easy to apply. I usually have trouble putting these on but when on without a problem and it is barely noticable!,5
"I don't like them, they keep coming up off of the phone, too thick.",2
"Purchased this to protect my new iphone 4. The product fits well, but it's tough to apply the protector without getting a piece of dust underneath it. Be sure to take your time and find a dust free area when you're applying the cover.  The cover eventually scratches so you'll end up using a few of them. Not sure how they're making any money charging $0.80 cents though?",3
This item was very easy to apply but something that really bothered me was that the screen protrector scratches very easily. Now I know why they sent 5 more on the pack....because the screens scratch way too easily. I'm very disappointed. I now have to apply another one.,3
"'I received the item in a timely manner, however, the screen protectors are of cheap quality & I had to use 3 to somewhat get it right. The price was very cheap, but now I see why. 'The feedback above is what I left on 10/25/11. Today I received a call from the seller trying to rectify the situation. I explained to the seller how I felt & he was eager to make good on my purchase by sending a complimentary item if I removed the following feedback I left on 10/25/11. Once I receive my complimentary item, I will come back to update this review, but until then, my previous feedback is current.",1
its like tape on it if you ever put tape on ur phone you can not even see it when it on fit great,4
THESE SCREEN COVERS ARE REALLY GOOD AND WORK WELL .THEY HOLD UP REALLY GOOD AND ARE WORTH THE MONEY GRETA PRODUCT WILL BUY AGAIN,4
"i had to say that the product is not too good or too bad. small product. does what it needs to do. however, the anti-glare work it boasts to do is not much done in reality.",4
I had no problem applying. Fits greatly on my iPhone 4. Great price when I bought 3 from apple for $16 and they didn't last long. Definitely recommend.,5
These screen protectors are great for the price. What do you really expect when they are under $2.00. If you take your time and really clean the screen and apply them carefully they will work.,4
"The screen protectors are ok, it is pretty hard to get rid of the bubbles but once you put it on it lasts. Actually it started annoying me after a few days so I took it off probably because of my failure to place it on without the bubbles.",4
I'm really dissappointed. when I opened the envelope there was 6X front protectors. I thought there would be back protectors too :(,3
I recommend it for iPhone 4 or 4s.  I removed the size adapter and it fits my phone with the case.,5
It came to me broken and in a damaged plastic case.  I didn't bother buying another one like it or anything since I have a case on my iPhone and need to test it out with docks in person.,1
"My wife bought this dock from a third party seller, and even though the product was shipped by Amazon, it was not a new unit. We should have heeded warnings from other reviewers. It seems all these sellers, or at least the sellers with the lowest price, are selling used/refurbished units (or maybe even fake but there's no way for me to know for sure) that are defective or customer returns. We placed the order twice and the first time, no USB cable was included (other folks seem to have had the same issue) and the second time the cable included was a generic cheap USB cable, not the one originally supplied by Kensington. No wonder a dock that is usually available for $30 or so in stores is available for half the price here.I hate to rate this product a 1-star because I feel it doesn't accurately reflect Kensington's product quality, but rather our purchasing experience as a result of dishonest sellers.I find it surprising that it was so difficult to find a reliable dock that was original and brand new. I eventually purchasedDexim DCA192 Single Dock Charger for iPhone & iPod (Black). This was sold and shipped by Amazon. Received a sealed box with all accessories included. This dock works like a charm and I love it.Hope this information saves you the trouble we went through. Yes, this dock is available at a low price, but there's a good reason for it.",1
"So far, three of my co-workers bought this when they saw mine. Too bad I can't use it anymore because I switched to Iphone 5 and so did they. Will buy Kensington brand once the come up one for Iphone 5.",5
"I use this on my desk at work to keep my iPhone charged throughout the day. It's the only way I make it through the day without my phone going dead.I think it's stupid that it didn't come with a wall adapter, but once you get one, you can't go wrong.Works like a charm.",4
"This is a decent charging dock. For the price, it is tough to beat. My only complaint is that I wish it came with a power adapter to plug into the wall. The inlcuded USB connection cord is a good length and will most likely be all you need. I have only used the dock a handful of times to sync with my computer, but each time it worked great.The dock itself is fairly light, but still seems sturdy enough. The included inserts will NOT work if you have any type of case on your iPhone. I have the CaseMate BarelyThere case which doesn't add hardly any bulk, but the phone will not fit with the case on in the included iPhone 4 insert. Subsquently I just leave all inserts out and stick my phone right in the connector and leave it free-standing. Not ideal, especially if you think it could get bumped or toppled over. Mine just sits on my night stand so no real worries there.Would love for this product to be able to have an audio line out, but again, at this price, it is still a good buy. I would recommend this product.",4
"What's the point have a docking station without an audio output? There is no audio output on this unit. Basically, it's a usb adapter with a base for $20, which you can find one on auction site for 1/4 of the price. Failed!I have aBelkin Power Dock for iPodin other room, it works perfectly. And I wanted a black one for my desk...I still can't believe it, seriously Kensington? lol",1
"The unit came in a plastic envelope - no box, no instructions, and most importantly, no cable.  This is in contrast to the description, and I'm returning the product because of this.I can't say how well it works, other than that with the little dock connector adapter sleeve, it's impossible to fit a phone in securely with a case on.",1
"Put them on my desk, making me look professional and stuff. Would have been better if it has a built-in speaker or speaker-output. Been months and still working just fine. Making me look bad-@$$ and stuffs. Worth the money.",5
I use this on my desk at work and it works well.  A plug end should have been included with the stand as I am not allowed to plug anything into a USB slot on my work computer.,4
"As advertised. Instead of placing my ipod touch on the desk grabbing the sync cable and inserting it in, now I just place it on the charger. It has its on secure space. Peace of mind! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I thought it would come with a wall adapter, so you could plug it into a wall socket. It does not. It only comes with a usb sync cable to charge from a computer. I bought it with the idea of placing this cradle on my nightstand.",4
I didn't like the fact that when i needed to charge my phone i had to take offthe case. So now it is in my draw not being used.No will not recommend!!!,2
Always ready for me to plug my iPhone in and charge and I love it. Can't say anything negative about it.,5
"I've bought other charger sync docks and they didn't last. I've had it for several months with no problems. Only issue, you can't have a case on to put it in the dock.",5
"The device works as expected. I always keep it alongside my desktop PC to sync/charge my iPod touch. It works pretty much as advertised and it looks nice.The only con (and that's why it got 4 stars) is that the iPod does not slide naturally onto the dock. I need to maneuver it a bit to get it to seat properly on the dock. But that's not a big deal.Also, it would have been nice if the USB cable were a bit longer. I needed to buy an extension cable to reach the USB at the back of my desktop tower.But it does do the job very well.I'm starting to use the Cloud more and more - but syncing with a cable is much faster.",4
"I liked this item and it works as stated but you can't use the phone while it's cradled i.e if you hit safari then sms opens, if you hit notes, email pops up... and so on, to me all i wanted was a charger at my office along with a cradle and it did the job for me... if you plan on using it while cradled i advise you not to buy it... good quality and nice looks and compact :)",3
"I've been using this daily for 6 months to charge my iphone, and I haven't had any problems with it at all. I'll probably be buying another one.The only issue I've had is if you have a case on your phone, it won't fit in the molded holder. Removing the case is a pain. You can remove the molded holder, but then there's no support and you risk damage to both the phone and/or charger at the connection port if something hits it.  To solve this problem, I used some Sugru (moldable plastic - google it) to make a backrest for the phone on the back of the cradle. It works great, and I've had no further problems with the phone wobbling around in the cradle.",5
"To use this stand with your iPhone 4S with either bumpers or the Splash case, simply remove the iPhone 4 plastic insert that it comes with and use it 'naked'.The stand charges and syncs flawlessly with the included usb cable.The price is unbelievable, and the delivery speed was as promised.I bought 2 of these stands - 1 for home and 1 for the office.When my phone is fully charged, I simply place the phone on the stand without pushing it down all the way, so that I can view my phone in the upright position.If I need to charge or sync the phone, I push down fully in order to make contact with the pins.",5
"It's made by Kensington, so it's good quality. However, I didn't read the description well enough and thought it would include an adapter to plug it into an AC outlet. That's not really a problem though, as those are pretty reasonably priced on Amazon.",4
"I bought this for my wife's iPhone 3GS charging I am sure the dock can charge with iPhone 3GS with Speck Candy Shell and iPhone 4 with Speck Candy case .the Price is enough to low to purchase for each in my family...The problem I saw is when I opened the mailing bag upon the arrival,The condition of the product : Seems used or refurbished ( like returned product ) , Sure to not new...the original box was opened by someone before me and sealed by tape.And missed an adapter, the original has two of adapter, iphone and iphone 4G.I already sent a claim from order link.The product is worked OK but you should know you may receive the used/refurbished one from the Seller, Best N Price...The Photos were taken and put them on the product site for your review ...Update : Got a confirmation email to send a replacement from B N P.Very Quick response and hope I can get the replacement very quickly ...",2
HATED the quality.  The dock was sleek and did what a charge and sync dock should do.  The problem came when the connector to the back of the dock broke inside and I was unable to pry it out or fix it.  Too bad.,2
"The base feels solid and good quality. It was always a bit hard to get my iphone into the charger, it made a sound like it didn't fit. But it always started up; so now after 6 month, it stopped working. I switched cords and everything but nothing will bring it back to life. This really sucks. Don't buy it. Really.",1
"Any iPhone4 owner needs to put a case on their phone due to the antenna problem. Buy this for that reason and for a better grip on the phone.I do not recommend this case for protection purposes, as it is extremely flimsy.Thank you.",2
"When compared to the other silicone cases on the market (some of which are being sold for more than three times the price of this Amazon branded case) this case is the clear winner.  Unfortunately, this case suffers from all of the same problems other silicone cases suffer from. The case fits the phone well, but the silicone is very soft and stretchy so it tends to come off at the corners when being slid into my pocket.  The cut out on the back sure let's the pretty Apple logo be seen, but it also creates an unsightly lint trap.  All in all, the price is right on this case, but I think I'll be looking for more of a hard shell case to protect my phone.My final opinion: If you like silicone cases, this one is just as good as the rest at a lower price. If you prefer hard shell cases, this product will definitely NOT change your mind.",3
"The AmazonBasics Silicone Case is certainly adequate to the job of protecting your phone from basic bumps and bruises.  It is very thin, which I like--it does not add considerable size to the phone in the way that others have done.  The holes for buttons, camera, charger, etc. are all properly placed and it does not interfere with any functionality.The only thing keeping me from giving the full five star rating is that it is a little bit too loose, particularly on the sides of the phone.  This allows the case to pull away from the phone easily, which can be distracting (particularly if playing games involving turning the phone sideways or texting).  It is a minor problem, but as there is room for improvement, I will leave this at four stars in the hopes that the ergonomic engineers at AmazonBasics can address this in the next model.",4
"Original Review.  My first clear silicone case was perforated.  I guess the concept was so that when the battery got hot, it could 'breathe'.  However, the perforations allowed dust to get through the holes and onto the phone. After this experience, I went to the 'bumper', which was ok (but I like a case).The Amazon silicone case is not perforated and is comfortable to hold and I can easily to slip my phone in and out of my pocket.  I like the cutout on the back which allows the display of the Apple logo.So far, this is the best silicone case for my use (heavy calling using a wired headset).Edited Review: Lived with this case for a few more days & am back to the bumper case. Silicone is a little thin and it the case started becoming a little bit of an annoyance.",3
"I love that this fits the iPhone 4S, as I would expect, but it's really loose and doesn't stay snug all around.  It also adds quite a bit to the size and makes it hard to fit in my belt clip.  I do feel confident that it would protect my phone in most cases, just lacking in a few areas.",3
"I originally bought this case as a temporary cover until a decent priced Otterbox came out for the iPhone 4S. But its been over a month and I've had no problems. It's a slim durable cover. I haven't tossed my phone or anything, but it did drop about 1-2 feet, and no damage.I may just keep this as a permanent cover.",5
"I ordered this case by my mistake.  That's my fault.  I meant to order another one that I like better (and is also a few bucks cheaper).I much prefer theAmazonBasics Silicone Case and Screen Protectors for AT&T; and Verizon iPhone 4.  The other one is better and even includes Screen Protectors.This case is very basic.  It's not bad looking, but it only provides basic protection against dirt, the death grip, and very minor bumps.I highly recommend the other case over this one.",3
"It's essential that you protect your iPhone with a case -- it's an expensive piece of equipment that you carry around in your hand. Granted, it's actually a pretty tough piece of equipment. But even so, it's worth taking the precaution of buying a case. I've tried out a few different kinds over the years. This one from AmazonBasics is exactly what the name implies: a basic case, sold at a reasonable price. I'm not as enamored of these silicone cases as I am with some of the other types. I have a hard plastic case for my iPhone 4 that I prefer. However, the silicone case makes a lot of sense for my daughter's phone. They're easy to put on, make the phone easy to grip and keep in your hand, and provide a good level of protection from bumps and drops. There are better cases out there for the iPhone, depending on your needs. But there are few that are more reasonably priced.",4
"I have owned many silicone cases for all types of phones and devices and this is by far the flimsiest and worst case I have seen, felt and owned.It's a shame that Amazon would even put their name on a silicone case that is so flimsy.  When I say flimsy I mean that it fits loosely and isn't worthy for an Apple device.  The edges are not snug thus allowing dust and debris in and I don't know how much protection this case would really provide?  The silicone is thin, flimsy and I certainly would not recommend it to anyone.Lousy engineering, cheap materials, too thin and WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.  $15.00!  Are you kidding me?!  Go with Speck or better yet, an OtterBox caseOtterBox Impact Case for iPhone 4  (Black) (Fits AT&T; iPhone)for a few dollars cheaper and you will get a case that really does the job (for a silicone case).  I also have to say that using a box for 'frustration free' packaging is overkill.  The plastic baggie the case came in is sufficient enough, no extra box is needed.Amazon missed out on this one.  Don't waste your money!Updated 2/10/11 - the case has dropped it's price in half since I reviewed it.  The price is still too expensive in my opinion and the product needs to be tightened in the lab and better materials used.  Not worthy of an Apple device.Updated 2/26/12 - the price is back up to it's original.  Not sure if this case has changed in any way but the one I received was flimsy and cheap.",1
"I have a Black iPhone Silicone Case.There are cutouts for the headphone jack, power switch, volume switch and the charging port.  Oddly, there is a window for the Apple symbol on the back.  I personally prefer protection for the volume control buttons; however, this is a simple design.  The case doesn't interfere with accessories and is easy to install.Overall, it's a very good case for the iPhone 4.",4
"What i love, is that no one has it haha and everyone asks me where do i get it, i just say, amazon.looks good.",5
"A basic silicone case with an interesting embossed design around the Apple logo window; simple cutouts for the buttons and ports. Nice material, firmer than the Incipio ones (for the 3G), and feels like it has a good grip. However, it is slightly loose around the sides; I'd rather it were a bit tighter. As it is, little bits of dirt are likely to get inside, and you'll have to remove it now and then to clean it out.It would also have been nice if there were some covering around the power and volume buttons.There's no problem inserting earphone jacks or chargers. Did not come with screen protector.Update: I seem to have picked up a 'spite' vote. I don't mind it except it would be nice to know if there is disagreement and I have misjudged the product, or if it's simply because the voter disliked my views on another product.",3
"I decided to pick up the AmazonBasics Silicone Case for my iphone.  I didn't take it out of the package before I got it to see how strong it felt.  When I opened it up I was a little skeptical.  It didn't feel very strong, but I gave it a shot anyways.  The case fit my phone good.  Well it lasted about a week and a half until it ripped.  It wasn't a big one, but just enough to bother me.  I do keep my phone in my pocket so maybe with the tight fit it just kept stretching it everytime I took it in & out.  I don't know.  So I had to go back to my old one until I made it to the store to buy a new one.  I like the rubbery cases, but this one was a little flimsy for me.",3
Cheap product for the money! Not worth $10I advise you not to buy!I want my money back but that's even a problem through amazon,1
"I was happy to find a silicon case at a good price. The case fits well, however , with the silicon material I have to be careful around moisture or if it is in a pocket too long. The material entraps moisture so be careful if you aren't experienced with the material.",5
"I wasn't expecting too much, and that's pretty much what I got (I purchased the silicone version, not the leather one...why do they combine the reviews for two different products?).  In fairness I bought it as a temporary case until I could figure out what I really want to protect my new iPhone 4S.  The biggest negative is the case puckers pretty badly wherever there are openings along the sides (like at the volume buttons, etc.), which I found so annoying I ditched it after a couple of days.  I found a Case-Mate Barely There case on clearance at an office supply store (the case I really wanted anyways and it cost less than this one!) - it provides even less protection than the AmazonBasics case, but it sure looks a lot cooler, and no puckers!",3
"I was looking for a case that did not add bulk, like the Otterbox did, and this fit the bill.",4
I gave this to my wife to use because I am using an otter box for my iphone 4. She has been using if for several months now and really likes it. She uses it inside of a body glove case that has her credit cards and license in it. It keeps her phone from falling out of the larger body glove case and makes it easier to grip.Pros:Edges are lower than other cases and you can touch to the sides of the screen easily.Protects the phone wellSlim designNice lookingEasy to clean and doesn't attract dirtDoesn't get sticky when using a baby wipe to clean it unlike other rubber casesCons:Easily removed and sometimes slips off. Maybe a problem for someone who is handling the phone a lot. A very minor problem for us.Overall we are both very happy with the phone case and I may switch too it when I am not working because the otter box really is a huge case when you compare the two.,5
"My review will be quick and concise :)Value for money:* Good: Pretty good case for a rather cheap price.'Installation':* Very easy to put it on and take it off* No need to take it off in order for it to fit to my iHomeGrip:* Better than a standard silicon case, it's kind of stiffer and I really liked it.* Slide easily into your pocket* Holds well on any surface, I like to put it on my leg - and it holds well!* The case holds the phone almost perfectly (at least in my case), there is a certain point where is has some gap, but generally good.Looks:* I took the black one, and really liked how it looks. It has some spiral texture at the back, which makes it interesting, but not too loud.* Overall look is pretty good, specifically in black, though my friend claims it should be thinner.Dirt:* From time to time, you will find small grains on it, like salt and other kinds of dirt. This is a bit annoying, but they go off quickly.",4
"Very good when looking for a non-sliding surface, but it begins to brake because fit is not tight enough. But lasted for some months.",4
"This makes case #3 i've tried for this phone. All of them are OK. otterbox was probably the best, but just so massive in size. Overall, it's a thinner profile and OK, but definitely not going to protect your phone from a big drop.",3
"Amazon's basic case for your iPhone 4 is perfect for someone not looking for anything flashy, but rather on the functional side. It feels rubbery so there is a grip to it, and its flexible so its easy to put on. It may after wear and tear eventually fall off (as I imagine happening), but this is not a stress or concern for me. The design is all black and simple, nothing flashy about it with a little Amazon logo on the bottom right. All the holes are in the appropriate spot with a circle in the back to let the Apple logo show through. Does it do its job as a protector? Well, I have not dropped my phone, which is the best protection for any phone, but as far as I can tell, it works better to hold onto it than protect it from falls or anything like that.",5
"i used this for couple of weeks then begin to fit loose, so much that the camera hole is blocked very often. is a good product when is new.",2
"This black silicone case does the job for protecting the back and sides of your iPhone 4. The texture is very soft. The silicone is so pliable however, that putting it in and out of my pocket sometimes catches the edge and peels it partly off. The sides especially are weak and are easily peeled back.I am going to back to my iPhone bumper and Zagg front and back shield",3
"This silicone case for iPhone 4 AT & T is as good as any case I have had in the past for my iPod or past 3G iPhone.  At a price of under $10.00, this is a tremendous value as comparable cases in the Apple Store are $30.00 or sometimes more.  Here are the bullet points:-Fits iPhone 4 perfectly but not too tight or loose with spaces for all of the buttons, holes, plugs, etc.-A brief description of those:  Open at bottom for speakers and charger spot.  Open at top of left side for volume and ringer on/off slider.  Open at top left for headphone plug.  Open at top right for power button.  There is a hole in the back center for the Apple logo.  There is a hole in the back upper left for the camera and flash.-Note that this does NOT come with a cover for the front of the phone and it's touch pad.  My recommendation would be to purchase this in conjunction with an invisishield that sticks right on the front to protect the face.  This would be a separate fee of course.-The case does not come with a stand, or belt clip, or anything else like some other cases do.  This is OK because many times I do not use those anyway.-The back of the case has silicone swirls on it to make the grip easierI like this case a lot because I can put it on my iHome dock and not have to take the case off.  This is key.  I also of course can charge it from a cord or car charger and not have to take the case off either.  It's a great and solid case whose only drawback is consistent with other silicone cases where the front sides can flare out a bit but not to the point of any annoyance.Needs more colors, but an awesome straight forward case that will protect your iPhone and certainly help cushion a drop.  Recommened for sure.",5
"This cover is like most of the generic silicone coverse available - fits ok, takes care of the reception problem, and makes the device easier to hold and grip.But, I find it awkward because it is flimsy and just a bit too loose. Sometimes when I grab it in a rush to leave, it squishes around the edge of the phone, and I always worry it will fall off. since I dropped this and the face cracked, along with a coveroo hard cover, I don't really feel at all confident about keeping this on. I know other users who don't seem to be as accident prone in carrying their phone as I am, and they like this item just fine.It's good for gripping, helping make the iphone actually usable as a phone :) and that's about it.",3
"PROS:This silicon case fits my iPhone 4 PERFECTLY.I can use the USB plug to plug it in for charging without removing the case.Smooth enough to take out of a pocket without trouble, provided it's not 100% cotton material.'Rough' enough to grip smooth surfaces so it doesn't slip easily.Attractive backside design.CONS:Available in only a few solid colors.Does not come with clear 'cling' display protector.I can't use it with a docking station.The cover did come off once when I was trying to dig it out of my pocket. It stuck too well to the cotton inside of the pocket on that occasion.",5
"If you don't get outside much, then this is the iPhone case for you- very minimal, but very thin. However, it does fit nicely in your pocket with this one on.",3
"Nice, easy to use case.  The only drawback that I've found is that it is a bit thinner material than the case I had for the iPhone 3.  But that would make it perfect for those looking for the thinner case.",5
"This case is reasonably attractive and sturdy if you like this sort of case.  The rubber didn't attract as much dust or stick to the inside of my pockets as much as some other cases of this type Ive had in the past.However the showstopper for me was the that a portion of the case over the volume buttons would not fit flush.  I found this really irritating for some reason.  However, given the price of this case compared to a lot of other solutions Id say there's still a lot of value here.",3
"I was just glad to see a cover made for the i4, but I still like the i3 style and covers better as far as fit, this one can pop off too easily with very little effort.",4
"There's really not that much to be said about this case. It's a very, very basic case.. Getting the phone into it is simple, as the silicone is very, very malleable (too malleable).Pros:Simple design, Apple logo visible (if that's your thing), all buttons/ports easily accessible.Cons:Far too .... squishy. In tight pockets the case can easily come off to a certain degree. It's also quite unattractive around the screen since the case isn't rigid but very floppy in its lines.Overall, it's not expensive, but it's also not very good either. I'd save your money for a case that's a bit more protective and solid.",2
"First of all - the case I had on my iPhone 4 previously was one of the free ones they give you to alleviate the signal loss issue. I like this one much more. It's a little bit thicker, though not too thick to slide in and out of my pocket. It's a little loose around the sides which can be a bit annoying since it puffs out slightly on either side making it seem like the phone doesn't quite fit snugly enough, but I haven't had any problems with the case slipping off the phone. I mostly like the design - the cutout in the back allows the Apple symbol to show through, which I appreciate, but the hole on the side of the volume buttons is a bit too big. The case I previously had covered those buttons but labeled them on the outside of the case and let you push the buttons through the case. I feel like exposing the buttons exposes the phone unnecessarily. Everything else is fine and I like the neutral black color and the circular design, though I wouldn't mind if 'amazon basics' weren't embedded in the bottom of the back of the case. I think it would look nicer with no label.",3
"The amazon basics cases are the best!!! I have the black, pink, white and red. They are all perfect. Well made and feel great on our phones. I wish they made these for iPhone 5.",5
"First of all, let me say I'm thrilled to see Amazon jump into the fray with a 'Basics' product in this category.  It makes a lot of sense, and I love the minimalist approach to packaging and 'junk' associated with delivering the product.This combination iPhone case and screen protecter delivers a nice bang for the buck - you basically get 'two in one' by getting the case and the screen protector for less than what you would pay for another case alone of similar quality.The screen protector itself is very nicely put together, with two separate tabs on the inside and outside cover that allow you to peel off the one side, apply to the phone with the included squeegee, then remove the top protective film.  This really helps in lining up the protector and also keeps you from scratching its surface while rubbing the bubbles out.  By the way, a trick for re-positioning these kinds of 'cling film' type protectors if you need to pull it off for any reason:  use a piece of scotch tape and let it hang over the side to create a 'tab'.  Use the tab to pull the screen protector up away from the phone surface.  If you get a speck of lint or junk trapped under the protector, you can use this method along with another piece of tape applied directly to the lint/dustball - the tape will pull the lint away from the screen cleanly, and you can reapply easily.  For clarity, fit, and ease of installation, I rate the screen protector FIVE STARS.The silicone case is less impressive to me, unfortunately.  I have both a hard shell case from iFrogs (iFrogz Luxe Lean Case for iPhone 4 (Green)and theGriffin Technology Reveal for iPhone 4 (Black).  My favorite of the three is the Griffin for some very specific reasons regarding protection and coverage.  Unlike the Amazon Basics unit (or the iFrogz), the volume control and on/off buttons are covered by the silicone case, preventing moisture from damp hands (think 'using the phone when its raining or answering the phone when you just washed your hands).  Also the bottom of the Amazon case (where the dock connector and speaker/mic grills are located) is more or less completely open, whereas the Griffin unit has specifically sized cut-outs for the dock connector and speaker/mic grilles.  Another nit-pick is the fact that the Amazon unit has a cut-out in the back so that it shows the Apple logo.  This may be important to some, but I'm not THAT much of a fanboy where I feel the need to display my apple logos despite my protective case.  I rate the case itself THREE STARSAll in all, the Amazon Basics unit is a very good value in a silicone type case because you get a screen protector along with the case and they use very easy packaging (I think Amazon calls it 'frustration-free' packaging or something like that).  However, it falls short for me when compared to similar (albeit more expensive) products from other vendors in the same category.  Total package rating:  FOUR STARS",4
"The case is easy to put on and would provide what I'd consider to be 'moderate' protection for your phone. It'll prevent your phone from developing scratches and chips from regular wear and tear. If you've ever tried to keep your iphone in good condition without a case you probably learned fairly quickly that even just toting it around in your purse or pocket is enough to eventually cause some scratching. The silicone casing gives you a nice grip on your phone and the case itself is easy to take off which is important since most accessories are impossible to use with a phone case. I like that it comes with a cleaning cloth, something that I wish apple continued to include with the iphone product itself since we all know that it's a fingerprint magnet. At $15, this is one of the least expensive cases you can purchase that won't leave you feeling short changed on the overall value of the product.That said, I have decided to switch back to my more expensive otterbox defender case and sacrafice the ease of having a case that I can easily remove. Having replaced my iphone a whopping three times in the past two years I just started to worry that the silicone case wouldn't be enough to protect my phone from me. If you're reasonably careful to begin with, then this is probably more then enough protection for you and I would highly recommend it.",5
"I have an iPhone 4 and thought I would give this a try. When I first got my phone I picked up a screen protector at the AT&T; store, but hated it because it left bubbles and if you get a speck of dust under the film it leads to a disaster. The guy at the AT&T; store said the iPhone 4 has better scratch resistance than the older models of iPhone, so I decided against using a screen protector and instead opted for a leather case with a flip-cover to protect my phone when it's in my purse. I have had my phone for several months and never had a problem with scratches on the screen.This screen protector from Amazon did the exact same thing as the AT&T; protector. I cleaned my iPhone and very carefully followed the instructions provided, but got one little dust particle. I tried to pick it off, and then wipe it, but it gummed up the sticky-back.  At that point the screen protector was useless. If you want extra screen protection I would recommend using a flip-cover. I have the Belkin Verve Folio Leather Case and LOVE it!!! $26.48 on AmazonBelkin Verve Folio Leather Case for iPhone 4, BlackAs for the silicone case. The phone dropped right into the case and I love the grip dots on the side, but my phone did not fit snuggly in the case. There are cut out holes for the camera and buttons and they align quite well. There is protection for the back and sides, but not the front. If you want a extra-durable case, try the Otterbox Defender case. It fits snuggly and protects the back, sides, and front. Great price on Amazon $22 with free shipping!OtterBox Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black)",1
"This is a disappointing case. The screen protector is extremely difficult to apply without bubbles and replicates the mirror finish of the naked iPhone glass. This case feels awful pulling the phone out of your pants pocket. The case is the consistency of gummy bears and is a very loose fit around the phone. I've actually come to dislike this case a lot.The silicone case is a very loose fit. The silicone has a kind of oily soft feel to it, not exactly a rich feeling. The front side rim is fairly tall, adding roughly an eighth of an inch to the phone (total extra thickness is 3/16ths of an inch). On a phone that is only one half inch thick, this is a significant thickness addition (nearly double). The worst part of this case, the volume control is exposed through a cut out leaving one more loose flap of silicone material. The bottom dock connector flap is unavoidable, since the base has to be pretty much open to use the dock connector, speaker, and microphone. The power button on top is also an open cut out.The case just doesn't feel very good in my hand. The nubs on the sides remind me where to grab the phone, but they are not very comfortable. Overall, this feels like a cheap piece of very flexible rubber / silicone to put over an incredibly elegant, well designed phone. The round opening to expose the apple logo just looks tacky.My frame of reference for this case is a Speck PixelSkin HD silicone case. The design concept is very similar, except Speck used a firmer material, got the button coverage right, and exactly the right rim height (1/8th of an inch narrower).Speck Products PixelSkin HD Case for iPhone 4 (Black)If you like the glossy look of the iPhone4 screen, then this screen protector is right up your alley. I'm not a huge fan of the reflectivity if I'm going to add a screen protector. I have applied a lot of screen protectors from SkinIt to Zagg, in addition I have applied more decals / stickers to toys and models than you can ever imagine. I have never had so much difficulty getting a protector applied properly, bubble free. Amazon Basics did a great job labeling the front and rear of the protector (peel label 1 first, apply the protector, and then peel label 2). Trouble is, this is a very difficult piece to line up properly, getting it on the phone squarely. I had to peel the cover back three times to get the film square. By that time several bits of dust dropped on my screen (the first two pull backs, there was absolutely no dust - a perfect clean application but crooked). Now I have to live with bubbles under the film. Zagg uses a liquid float to get the protector aligned properly, allowing for slip to position, and then squeegee out the liquid and bubbles.Overall, I'm disappointed with this case and screen protector. Both will certainly protect an iPhone4, trouble is, they do it without much style.Oddly this is an over packaged product. The frustration free packaging is cardboard and easy to open. The strange part, this is a super flexible 3x5 inch silicone product with a plastic film inside it, packaged in a rigid 5x8x2 inch box. That's a huge volume box for a very tiny piece of virtually indestructable silicone. The box doesn't appear to be labeled for direct shipping. I think a much smaller, less cardboard box would be much better.",2
"iPhones aren't cheap.  I'd never let my phone go 'unprotected'.  I broke the screen on my 3GS by dropping it from about 15' off the ground.  Even though I had a fairly durable rubber skin with a hardshell case, It landed perfectly on the corner and cracked the screen.So what about the Amazon Basics case?  I like this case a lot, but it won't protect my iPhone 4 from any type of impact.  I assume it protects against the 'Death Grip' (I never experienced this with my phone, so I can't say whether this case has any effect or not).This case basically keeps your phone from getting grubby and grimy.  Although dirt & lint can get in through the access holes, the screen is perfectly protected with the plastic guard.  The guard works well, although it took me a little time to get used to having to tap and drag harder than without the cover.I really like Amazon Basics products and I'm glad to see them providing low-cost accessories for phones.  However, this isn't like an Amazon Basics USB cable where a cable is a cable is a cable.  There really is a wide range of quality and features in alternative products, like theOtterboxcases.This case is still better than some of the cheap beetle cases that my kids like to use though.All in all, between the rubber case, the screen protector, the cleaning cloths, and the detailed instructions, this case is a very good value.",4
"This Amazon Basics silicone case is remarkable similar, with notable exceptions, to one thePremium Soft Silicone Gel Skin, one of the first inexpensive iPhone 4 cases on the market.  The Amazon Basics case adds a tiny cleaning cloth, one screen protector (forget the plural in the product name), and a squeegee for application of the protector.PLEASE NOTE:  Amazon has combined product reviews for different Amazon Basics cases, some with screen protectors and some without. Also, different colors share the same reviews.  Customers should check the descriptions to see which version they are ordering.The Case: Four StarsFirst, the pros:  it has textured bars on the side for firm gripping; the case slips on easily; the cut-out for the rear camera is two-tiered, which protects the lens without casting a shadow over it; the silicone minimizes the possibility of the phone slipping out of your hand; controls are easy to reach; it's inexpensive and unobtrusive.The cons:  the case doesn't fit tightly; as I pull it out of my handbag pocket, the sides can get caught and can open up, thus becoming a lint catcher; the circular cut out in the back to display the Apple logo is unnecessary and perhaps will catch its share of dirt.The Screen Protector: Three StarsI've never used a screen protector for either one of my iPhones, but I figured that, since one came with the case, I'd give it a try.  Now I'm not so sure.  Make sure you use the squeegee (a small plastic tab) to apply.Pros:  it adds a protective layer over the 'gorilla glass'; it does not impede the touch operation of the phone.Cons: you have to get the plastic lined up perfectly the first time; no matter how careful I was, I couldn't avoid two small areas with bubbles that I still can't get out; the iPhone glass is easier to get clean than the plastic protector surface; the sharp lines around the phone openings look and feel, well, less elegant than the original.If you really want a screen protector, then I'm sure this is as good as any other, but I have never had a problem with scratching either my 3G or my iPhone.Recommendation:  I would get this for the case and not the screen protector, unless you're going to buy a protector anyway.  This inexpensive option to protecting your phone works well enough for a reasonable price, although I find theReveal Etch, which has a hard back that supports the sides enough to improve the fit, a better option.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",3
We have a Verizon iPhone 4.  This case seemed like a nice alternative to the higher priced ones but it does not fit well at all. It's loose along the side edges and comes away from the phone often. It has just been sitting on our desk unused and the case seems to attract dust.  It looks old.,2
"There are two things you should consider when choosing a case for your iPhone 4: first, what type of case you need; second, within that category, which case is best.Many designs are available today: bumpers, thin hard shells, silicone shells, hybrid shells (usually silicone + polycarbonate reinforcement), leather... The type you need is determined by the degree of protection you seek. Cases offering the most protection are of course the bulkiest; it's a tradeoff, at some point you start to wonder why you bought this gorgeous phone if it's to carry it around inside an ugly contraption the size of a brick (I'm looking at you, Otterbox!)The biggest problem with most cases other than the thin hard shells is that they increase the overall size of the phone, making it unsuitable for belt holders sized for the iPhone 4.The silicone cases such as this Amazon Basics model offer good shock protection, however the silicone is not always stiff enough to stay in place. Hybrid cases (like the Otterbox) address this issue by combining the shock absorption qualities of the silicone with a polycarbonate hard shell for improved structure. Best protection, at the expense of significant bulk. Bumpers and thin hard shells add the least bulk but offer very minimal protection.So, knowing this, if you decide a silicone shell is right for you, is this Amazon Basics a good choice? I'm glad to report that it absolutely is. Unlike a cheaper generic silicone case I had purchased before, this case is stiff enough to stay in place and hug the phone properly. The sides feature anti-slip grip bumps, and the case is a good compromise between thickness, protection and price. I still use my Otterbox Defender for critical situations (when I go running or rollerblading) but this Amazon Basics silicone case is just perfect for everyday use.Highly recommended -- if you think a silicone case is best for you.",5
Love this screen protector!  Fits perfectly on the iphone4 and is so easy to attach.  Never had a problem with bubbles and i'm sure it's because they include this handy little scraper that help smooth out all the bubbles.  Be sure to clean the screen prior to placing this protector down because you definitely don't want fingerprints or pieces of fuzz trapped between the protector and actual screen.Screen is still very sensitive to the touch so there's no worry about it prohibiting any use of the touch screen.  I would recommend you get this to save your phone from incurring any scratches!,5
"Love the iPhone 4 protection package. It's perfect. I do wish there were an extra screen protector but as long as you are careful how you put it on - use a drop or two of water on the screen, put the sticky side on, take a credit card and swish it to each side to get all the water bubbles out. Best way to get a no-air bubble screen on there. Otherwise, great lovely case. Love it.",4
This is an okay case if you never use your phone. This case is very cheap feeling and flimsy who would want this case?,3
"Basic silicone case in black snaps onto the Apple iPhone 4 without needing much of a stretch.  It's one solid piece, soft and rubbery, adding a little cushion to the case without standing out from the crowd.  The screen protectors are actually a single screen protector which must carefully be applied to the iPod screen because it's a single application that does not lend itself to adjustment.  A plastic squeegee is included for its application and I have many ideas to recycle the adorable Amazon logo imprinted hard card.  If you're talented, you can carve your own little guitar pick.  Set it in a gold bezel and have a one of a kind pendant.  The tiny cloth screen cleaner can be used on your reading glasses so it's not wasted by a single screen cleaning, but whatever you do, be sure to really clean the iPhone screen with this cloth prior to applying the screen protector!  AmazonBasics boasts minimal packaging, so I wonder why a warranty booklet was necessary with this product.  The directions for applying the screen protector were on a small, easy to follow single folded sheet that doesn't take up much space in the recycling bin.  The booklet and box, on the other hand, seemed to be not so necessary.  All in all, this AmazonBasics Silicone Case isn't elegant or even cute, but it should last at least as long as the phone contract and it's reasonably priced.  If you're looking for a soft case, it's fine.",4
"3 stars means its ok, and this case is ok.I give this product a big thumbs up for including a nice polishing cloth.  It also has the screen protector and the card for getting the bubbles out.Installation of the screen protector was uneventful.As for the case, its a love-hate relationship.  On the one hand I love the soft touch of the finish, its really top notch.  There are a lot of silicone products out there that are not as nice as this one.  It adequately protects the corners and has nice 'bumps' where your fingers hold your phone, providing an excellent tactile feel and sensation.  But the bad thing is that the silicone is also a bit too soft and doesn't want to hold its shape enough.  Those of you who know about these things would say that the durometer of the case (hardness level) is too low.  Its just too soft and too pliable.What this means is that sometimes I accidentally push the wall of the case away from the phone screen.  I've uploaded a picture.This is my second Amazon Basics cell phone case (the first I purchased on a lightning deal) and I think that they are very very good quality.  This one just has the durometer problem, the silicone needs to be harder.  Some people will think its great.  In fact, due to the way these products are made, its possible yours could be slightly harder or softer.  It has to do with how soon the product is demolded and how hot it is.I've uploaded a picture of my problem for your reference.In short, its ok, and not the level of quality that many of the AmazonBasics products have.  The value is acceptable, its even a fairly good price for what you get.",3
"I have tried.  I have tried many, many times, but I CAN NOT get a screen protector on my iPhone without lint, dirt, bubbles, corners peeling, etc.  This screen protector was no exception.  Once you mess up once, you MAY get another chance, but chances are a corner will no longer stick.  I focus on the screen protectors because they were the main draw of getting this set.  Silicone cases are a dime a dozen and this one is perfectly fine, but nothing special.  The screen protector in addition to the case seemed like a good deal, but alas, I screwed it up.  When I did have the protector on and tried to put on a tight fitting case it caused the screen to separate.I guess the bottom line is, if you are confident you can apply the screen protector and only want to use a looser fitting silicone case, this will work for you at a reasonable price.  If you have another case you might want to use, it will likely not fit with this protector.FYI - I finally paid one of those Kiosks at the mall to install the full body ZAGG protectors and I am very happy with that.  Probably because they put it on right!",3
"You have to hand it to Amazon with their 'basics' line - this is a well made, no frills iphone 4 case that gives you everything you need. It would be perfect for getting as a gift for someone who is getting a new iphone. The low cost makes it easy to replace with a more expensive case later or to use as a backup.",4
"Long story short: Rush hour. Cut off. Road Rage. Hurled iphone out window at other driver (the latest iphone, not last year's which is SO yesterday. What are you, not hip? Get it together, people. Always buy the newest iAnything. Small children in China are depending on you for their 18 hour a day jobs!).BUT, with this tremendous item enshrouding the phone in rubber-edged glory, the phone merely glanced off his forehead and he picked it up off the dash and examined it.'Hey, you know when the next iphone is coming out?'I smiled. How can one stay mad at a fellow iCultist?'Yeah, the iphone 27 is coming out next month, once they release the 26 this Friday.'He grimaced, rubbing his forehead pensively.'Damn. Now I have to get both of them.'I nodded in commiseration.'It ain't easy being this Hip, is it?'He shook his head.'Ain't cheap neither.'I leaned out the window of my shabby yellow Trabi.'Tell me about it. Haven't been able to lease a new car since 1986. Apple takes up all of my discretionary income. Plus my time, with those line-ups every month for the Latest Thing.'We looked at each other and shrugged.To be in The Club, one must sacrifice less vital things, such as food and sleep.He looked at my iphone.'Hey, nice case! Is it Official?'I squirmed in embarrassment and quickly revved my two stroke engine.'Uh, gotta go.''But what about the phone?' he asked, holding it up.'Oh, it's last week's model, you keep it. Getting the New One tomorrow!'I screeched off at 10 mph, happy with both the thought of my next iPurchase and that I wouldn't be frying in the chair for braining a fellow iCultist.Turns out Dad was right: always wrap it in rubber!Minus one star for not fitting the 27. But then, if it ain't proprietary, how do you sell all the New Extras every time?",3
"This case reminds me a lot of the gel skins that I used to buy for my old iPod (many generations ago).  It also sorta reminds me of the original Otterbox case design which sells for more than $20.  For the price, Amazon's silicone case is a great value, and it includes a screen protector and cloth to boot.  I still prefer theOtterBox Defender, for the same reasons many people disliked the original Otterbox design.  While the silicone case is great at absorbing and redirecting impacts throughout the case material, it's not smooth and can stick when pulling it out of your pocket or purse.  I prefer the designs where the silicone cases are wrapped with a polycarbonate shell.  That way, you get the best of both worlds.  Still, for the price, you get much bang for your buck.",4
"As the name says, it is a very nice and basic cover for your iphone 4. It is very easy to put on or take off and gives it adequate protection, atleast better than most of the clear ones out there. This isn't a hard cover, so the silicone will provide good protection incase of a fall. It also looks good and doesn't feel bulky at all. It does come with a decent screen protector. I only wish the fit was a bit tighter since if you put it in a pocket, it does look as if it might come off. Overall, a great product for a great price!",5
"Protection for a several hundred dollar iPhone is a must and I can't say I've seen anything that is fool-proof.  Unlike the Amazon basics hard-shell case for 3G, this thicker version is simply a rubber silicone encasement. It doesn't offer much protection from a drop, but the handling is much better.  The sides are textured to be easily gripped avoiding any slippage.The kit also comes with a thicker than normal screen protector.  I found this to be easier to line up on my screen than the thinner ones of past, but it was still a bit touchy.  Fortunately, the kit includes a Squeegee to help you line up the screen protector and to smooth out any bubbles that may appear after application.  This is a one shot deal to apply, but if you careful, you might only get a few tiny bubbles.  I know of no person that doesn't have a tiny bubble somewhere on their iPhone.The cleaning cloth is also a nice addition, so you can thoroughly clean the surface of your iPhone before applying the screen protector.  You can use it later to wipe the dirt and grease from the surface of your phone.  Someday, Apple or Amazon will produce a nearly fool-proof cover...but this is not exactly it.  I think I will purchase an 'Otterbox', as they seem to be much heftier.",3
It is a great value. I like it as it is very easy to slip on and take off for  cleaning purposes.,4
"Wish there were more colors from which to choose. Okay case for the Apple iphone4. Could be better. Screen protecter worked well for me, and the little screen wiper comes in handy.",3
I had to return the case the same day I received it because it didn't fit my Verizon iPhone 4s properly.  It bowed out on the left side  and just wasn't snug fitting properly on that side.  It didn't matter how I many times I tried to make the phone fit inside it.  I really wanted it to fit properly because it isn't a bad looking case.  I gave it a 1 star mainly because I found it not properly made and needing to return it.  I assume not all of these case are made improperly because some people like it.  Maybe I just got a bad one.,1
"The amazon basics line is really great. I have several different amazon basics and they all are very impressive in their effectiveness and their price. They simply do their job. This case is no exception. If you want a good case that protects your iPhone4 without being bulky or too flashy, then this is your case. It fits well, comes with a cleaning cloth, and for the time I have used it - has not disappointed.If you need a simple and 'basic' solution to your protection needs - then look no further to the well priced and very effective amazon basic case for your iPhone 4.",5
"There are a lot of choices for iPhone 4 skins and cases. This one although adequate would not be my first choice. First, I like that the skin goes on and off easily, but I thought the skin was a little too loose. The screen protector, although included, would not be the one I would use. I prefer theZAGG invisibleSHIELD for Apple iPhone 4 (Front)(Front). Although the Zagg invisbleShield is more difficult to install, it can be installed bubble free and truly does provide exceptional protection. If AmazonBasics comes out with a tighter fitting, thinner skin, I will definitely consider it.",4
"I've had an iPhone since the first version was introduced in 2007. And I've always had a case of one variety or another to protect them (I learned that soon after purchasing that first iPhone... when I dropped it).Of all the cases I've used, my favorite is the no-frills (in terms of its name and packaging) 'AmazonBasics Silicone Case & Screen.'Most cases do not protect the glass over the display, rather the case protects the back and sides. The AmazonBasics case take that an important step further by providing an invisible layer of protective film for the iPhone 4's sensitive glass (I already scratched mine prior to getting this case).The film is easy to install and the clever 'squeegee' enables you to smooth out all bubbles. You won't even realize its there.The rubber case makes the iPhone 4 feel more comfortable in your hand and provides an excellent grip. It also does an excellent job of protecting the phone should (or when) you drop it.An added bonus, for me anyhow, is that I can still dock my iPhone 4 in my charger and speakers dock with the case. Two thumbs way up on this product.",5
"With this package, the screen protectors are fairly nice, but I don't think the case works well at all.It's made of a very soft rubber with holes cut out around where the iPhone controls, speakers and ports are. Most cases cover up the controls, but remain soft enough you can still push the buttons. With this 'hole' approach, you have to reach into the case a little bit to operate the sleep button, volume controls and vibrate switch, which is a little more awkward.Worse yet, however, is the big hole at the bottom of the case where the iPod connector port and speaker/mic is. As I mentioned, the rubber on this case is very soft and because the hole on the bottom runs pretty much the width of the phone, the consequence is that you have a thin rubber strip about the size of a thick rubber band on the bottom front of the case. As you can imagine, this slides on and off the phone easily as it moves around in your pocket, and also has a tendency to get caught on keys and other objects much as you'd expect from having a 'rubber band' attached to the bottom of a phone.My recommendation is to consider buying the screen protectors separately, but opt for a different case.",2
"Silicone cases are a dime a dozen these days and that means you really have to work at them to mess them up.  So Amazon's iPhone 4 case is pretty much par for the course when it comes to silicone, meaning 'it's okay.'  You have to know what you're getting when you buy a silicone case.  You're getting a soft, floppy case that won't ever fit snug against your device.  It's just the nature of the material.  It offers some decent impact protection because it is significantly rubbery, but being rubbery, it's also almost 'sticky.'  You'll pull it out of a pocket to find lint and dust accumulated all over it, mainly in any little crevice the case has - and the Amazon case unfortunately has quite a few.  It's a thoughtful gesture to include a grippy side texture but this is exactly where every bit of grime from your pocket is going to end up.  And it never quite comes off until you just plain wash the case under some water (hopefully you remember to remove your iPhone.)What's really the problem here is the price.  At $15, Amazon simply prices this case too high.  Frankly, a place silicone at the bottom of my interest list, case-wise, and an under $5 price is where ALL silicone cases belong.  There are much better cases available for similar prices, such as the similarly modest Belkin Grip Vue, which, as of this writing, is available much *cheaper* than Amazon's own offering, or significantly more protective cases for just a bit more, such as Speck's fantastic CandyShell.",3
"If you are looking for a basic case for protecting your Iphone 4, then this product does a nice job at a decent price. The case is clear, but heavy duty, silicon, and does protect the screen. It does help to keep dirt and grime out and away from your phone (though not perfectly), but won't win you any designer awards, either, in terms of style. It is, as the name states, basic. If this is what your needs are, then, look no further.",4
"The silicone case is easy (as most silicone cases are) to install, fits snuggly, and offers a greatly enhanced grip.  Looks like it may not work with the CDMA (AKA Verizon) iPhone 4, but who knows.  I'm not sure if this case provides much in the way of protection if the phone's been dropped, but it's sure to be less likely to slip out of one's hand or off of most surfaces.The screen protector is on the thicker side, which makes it easier to install, and the squeegee also helps.  The screen is still responsive and continues to look amazing.All in all, it's a good value, ships fast, and is about as good as any silicone case/screen protector out there.",4
"If you are looking for an elegant solution for your iPhone then you are looking at the wrong product.  That being said, this is the Amazon Basics Silicone Case and screen protector ...keyword being Basics.  It is a basic silicone protective case for your iPhone and it works perfectly well in that regard.The screen protector is a covering for the glass front of the iPhone which reduces glare and protects the screen from scratches in pockes/bags...we all carry keys and other nick nacks in our pockets that cause scratches...Gorilla Glass or not...it scratches.Price: I dont know about you - but I have seen cases that are much more expensive (The Apple Bumper) that provide a lot less protection.  For the price Amazon charges you are getting a case and a screen protector.  Screen protectors alone cost a lot more then this entire kit.Pros: Price.Cons: Packaging - its frustration free but very Frustrating to see that they waste a small cardboard box...any envelope would work fine since there is nothing to break.One note of caution - you have to be very VERY meticulous when cleaning your screen prior to the screen protector application...the cleaner it is the less chances you have of getting bubbles under the protector.The package includes the case, the screen protector, instruction card, and Amazon Basics warranty pamphlet.  It also includes a polish cloth for cleaning the screen before the protector application and a squeegee to smooth out air bubbles..  Some air bubbles will dissipate over time...  Bubbles where u see a particle of dust/or other matter under the protector will not go away and will annoy you...Be sure that you want this type of solution and for the price you wont be disappointed.Personally I think its a 4 STAR product due to price and items included.  Yes there are more elegant solutions out there but they will easily cost you quite a bit more.  Remember - BASICS ... this is basic and it provides BASIC functional protection.",4
I am very impressed with the AmazonBasics line. This case has been a very good one for my iPhone 4. It fits neatly and snugly over the phone and protects it well. (I've dropped it twice and the case cushioned it very well.) I like that it is smooth rubber and flexible. I don't care to scratch my phone with some of the hard plastic varieties. The screen protectors work well; it just takes a while to line everything up before smoothing it on.I also love the Frustration-Free packaging. It's so nice not to have to fight to get everything open!The only drawback I can think of is that the case is slightly on the bulky side. It's not Otterbox huge but it isn't slim line either.,5
For the price this is an excellent case and screen protector.The case fits very well. It's a snug fit - not too tight that it's hard to get on and not too stretchy that it seems like it will easily come off.I do wish the sides on the front of the case were a little thicker so they covered just a little more of the front screen. If you don't have the screen protector lined up exactly right the case will rub on the side of the protector and allow air bubbles to form. It can get annoying after a while.One other minor complaint is that the hole in the screen protector for the front facing camera is a little too small. It's just about exactly the same size as the camera lens so if you are even slightly off when aligning the protector it gets in the way (it doesn't affect the photos much). I have used other protectors that have a much larger hole that is combined with the ear speaker and that seems much easier to get placed correctly.Overall for the price it's a great deal.,4
"Thanks to AmazonBasics. They are really being about cheap and basic. Screen is not really clear and transparent. While removing the sticker, piece of dirty dry glue got stick to the protector.I am returning it after the first minute I opened the package.AmazonBasics Silicone Case and Screen Protectors for AT&T; and Verizon iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S",1
"Provides excellent coverage, good cutouts to reach buttons ports, I was also impressed with the feel and color. My only complaint is that the material is a little floppy. What this does is leave the front face edge a little lose so debris may get inside in-between the cover and the iphone. I think they could stiffen the material for batter performance.Happy Shopping!",4
"I have had a number of Iphone cases and this is one of the better ones. Its superior feature, to me, is providing a nice secure grip and it's light weight. The case is textured in back with stylish semi-circles that also serve to provide a good grip. The back also has a cut out over the apple symbol. All controls are exposed. My other cases cover the volume controls and on and off button. The other above average feature is the weight, the case weighs virtually nothing. Lastly the red looks pretty good contrasted with a black Iphone. It is a muted shade of red not a plusing cherry or neon red. Screen protectors and every accessory I have tried had no problem with this case. Good choice for a very easy to put on and take off, basic level protection case, providing an excellent grip upgrade.",4
"For a basic silicone iPhone cover, this can't be beat for the sale price of five dollars plus change. However, I would hesitate at the original fifteen dollar cost because there is definitely not enough to the product to justify that fee.Not only do I like the way this case feels--firm in my grip--I also like the way it looks, especially in the showy red color. The thickness is reassuring because I have been known to drop my phone and I think this case is thick enough to absorb the shock.I have always been a fan of the distinctive Apple logo and am proud to display it through the cut-out in back, so that's another plus.All in all, I'm pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends. In fact, a friend who has lost feeling in his hands due to nerve loss from MS, tried it and he adds his praise to mine. He likes the fact that it's not constantly slipping from his grasp like his black plastic case does.The only thing better, in my estimation, would be if it came in a black-and-white zebra print. :-)Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 24, 2011Author of 'Dream Reachers' (with Chase Von) and other books",5
"I normally use a Speck case obtained via Apple's iphone 4 case program. It is a 2-piece case, with a rigid back. It's worked well and has helped my phone to survive some inevitable drops. I am much less impressed with this cover. The lack of a stiff back means that it is very loose along the sides. In fact, along the left side (where the buttons are) the case bulges out a bit, making it too easy for the case to be pulled off.I tried out two cases - one black and one red. The shade of red is pretty shocking and doesn't really seem to fit with the iPhone's design. Then again, I'm a guy in his late 30's so what do I know...The black case is more in keeping with the design of the iPhone, but also seemed to fit less well. I'm sure that this is a small production variance rather than a design issue.In case you were wondering, you cannot get two cases on 1 phone for extra protection.If you like the fact that the case comes off VERY easily, this may be the product for you. When it is time to replace my Speck case, I'll pick up another Speck or comparable product.",3
"As noted above, this is perfect for the Amazon Basics line -It works fine, easy to use, does the job.  I used it on an off for two years on my iPhone 4 and never damaged it.I did notice it would tend to slide of in my pocket, but that was never a major issue, it stillWorked fine, was easy to use, and did the job.",4
"I have a Red iPhone Silicone Case.  It's a little lighter than a conventional red.There are cutouts for the headphone jack, power switch, volume switch and the charging port.  Oddly, there is a window for the Apple symbol on the back.  I personally prefer protection for the volume control buttons; however, this is a simple design.  The case doesn't interfere with accessories and is easy to install.Overall, it's a very good case for the iPhone 4.",4
"This silicone case is quite thin, so I'm not sure how much protection my phone will get from it.  The best things about this silicone case is the color, and the hole in the back to show the Apple.",3
"The AmazonBasics silicone case is thin and lightweight, which is great.  The downside is that it's loose on the sides of the phone, which is annoying.  Obviously it offers no screen protection on it's own but it does protect the back of the case.  Overall the case is OK and the price point is good for basic protection.  I personally would spend the extra $15 or $20 to get a sturdier case, but this is better than nothing and a lot less expensive than other cases on the market.",3
"A relative of mine in Massachusetts bought an iPhone 4 last year and got a rather generic gel-style cover for it. (Like many people, she was terrified of dropping it, because it was so thin and shiny.) It worked well for the first 6 months, but when I saw her I noticed that she wasn't using it. 'Oh, it got all loose and didn't fit snugly any more. In fact it was more of a hazard than a comfort.' So when this AmazonBasics silicone case popped up on Vine, I ordered one and had it shipped to her. Her verdict so far: much better made, fits nicely, not too bulky, and no sign so far of stretching or slipping. And what more can you ask of a basic iPhone case? Recommended.",4
"The AmazonBasics silicon case for the iPhone does what it claims to do -- that is, provide your iPhone with a thin, yet protective silicon slip cover. It's got a subtle 'wave' pattern on the backside that helps ensure your phone doesn't slide around and stays put.Usually when I pick up a slip case for my iPhone or iTouch, they usually come with one or two transparent screen protectors. Unless it wasn't packed, mine came without one. Fortunately I had a few spares from other cases, so I was in good shape.",3
"love my silicone case. I got the red its a nice color red. Just wanted something simple, these last forever. I still have one for my previous phone its in new condition it never faultered at all but I needed to get a new one to fit my new phone.",5
"There really isn't much to say about a case for a phone.  It either fits or it doesn't.  This fits fairly well.I also had the AmazonBasics case for the 3GS iphone, and that one was a hard plastic shell.  This one is not.  It's a rubbery feel.  If you like the 'hard case' feel, this won't be for you.Also, I would have preferred a different color than red, but that appears to be the only color it is available in.",4
"If you bought your iPhone and spent a good amount of $$ on it, you probably would want to spend a little more money on a decent quality case to protect the said $$$ phone.  AmazonBasics Silicone Case will offer a little protection to your iPhone:  it fits over the phone decently, and protects everything on it *except the screen* This case will only protect it from minor falls, scuffs, and the like that doesn't include the screen.  That said, if you drop your phone, and it falls screen first onto anything...well, your screen won't be protected.  There is one opening that I found extraneous (which is noted in some other reviewer's photos), which is the circle opened in the back to show the Apple logo.  That really doesn't need to be there as it can lead to scuffing should anything get in between the case and the phone.  While I don't hate this protector, I probably wouldn't recommend it either.",2
"Gosh, this case 'feels' so good in my hand, I WANT it to work...but in reality, it is just too loose and flimsy to really trust.  They made it very lightweight, which is nice, but with that, the side pieces just wriggle and it doesn't feel stable.The color is pretty, and I like the swirl detail on the back, although I'm not sure why they put a cutout where the Apple sign is.  I want to protect my entire phone, not just part of it.Pros:SoftnessTextureColorLightweightPriceButtons are all accessible (I have a Verizon phone)Cons:Flimsy/Side pieces wriggleStrange hole where the Apple sign isI'm afraid that I won't be using this cover for my iPhone regularly.  I will keep it as a back up, if I have trouble with my regular cover.  I had hoped that this would be an awesome addition to my iPhone accessories--the price is good, and the color choices are nice--but I just don't trust it to protect my phone.  I'm afraid the whole thing will slip off if I drop it.**IMPORTANT EDIT**  I didn't want to change my initial review, but instead to add to it:  I have been using this case now since I received it and it's worked out just fine.  My worry about it being too loose or falling off was incorrect.  This cover has been great.  My initial impression (and first days of use) was over-worried...I guess I was thinking it'd be a harder-type case, and that it would wriggle around.  I was WRONG.  This stays in place, and looks great.So, I changed my star-rating to 4 from my original 2.  And now I remove that Con that says that it's 'Flimsy/Side pieces wriggle'.  After it settled in, that wriggling quit somehow.So, now I recommend it :)",4
"AmazonBasics Silicone Case for AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4 (Red)fits the iphone 4 well. It has a soft feel and is still durable. The case has a slight edging around the face which I like because that keeps it from laying on the screen if I set it down that way. The edge is not high enough to get in the way of texting or reaching any of the buttons. The ports are all easily accessed while the phone is in the case. I like this case because the back is textured just enough to not slip out of my hands, but not so much it sticks going in and out of my pocket. A nice case. The red color is even and deep. The case isn't made to take hard drops, like an otterbox, but is is good at keeping the phone scratch free and easily gripped.",5
I just received the Amazon iPhone4 Silicone case and I slipped on my iPhone and was pleased with the fit and lightness. I was also pleasantly surprised that signal attenuation levels were less noticeable than my previous case. It nicely allows for the display of the Apple Logo on back of phone.,5
"There is not a whole lot to say one way or the other about AmazonBasics case.  It is exactly how it looks, a very simple silicone case which covers up your phone and protects it from basic drops.  Buttons are carved out from the case, but oddly, there is also a hole carved out for the Apple logo to show through.  Are people really this vain and silly?  I would prefer more protection.It fits the phone nice and snug and is easy to hold.  If you are just looking for protection, you could do a lot worse.",4
Fits like a glove.  Helps keep phone from sliding around and adds a diva flair.  Love the color.  The only draw back is that is won't protect the phone from breaking like the more bulky covers.,5
"Recently, I bought 2 silicone covers by Philips. I trust the brand and even though they were cheap, they worked fine. At least I thought they were fine until I got this one for 1/2 the price.I love this cover. It isn't the hard plastic armor that some need. I might not be gentle with my phone but I am also in need of metal body cladding.This didn't smell out of the package, which was a wonderful thing considering how close to my face it is when I use it. Its something that you don't think about until its too late. The cover is textured, which makes it easier to hold with sweaty hands or just lotioned hands (hey, it happens!). The buttons are all easily used when the case is on and the best part is that it doesn't interfere with my car adapter or my clock radio when charging.The one drawback is that although it is snug, it is starting to stretch ever so slightly allowing the cover to pull up when taking in and out of my pocket. Kind of stinks but not unworthy of the price!",4
"This is a thin silicone cover, but thick enough to keep you from denting the outside of your IPhone-as long as you don't drop it on the screen.  It is a good color, has nice ridges on the back for grip and stays on very well.  As I mentioned before, it offers NO protection for the screen at all-it would be nice if they'd included some kind of clear cover on the front, but I ended up using those sticky screen protectors along with this case.  Overall, there are obviously better cases, but for $9, this one isn't bad!",3
"It seems that tons of these were sent out through the Vine program.  I can't read all the reviews but the ones that I did read were pretty spot-on.  This is a basic bumper case.  Fairly flimsy, by no means a tight fit.  Molded silicone.  Picks up lint like nobody's business.  One good thing is that it is loose enought that it does not pull up screen protectors at the edges like the ones Apple sent out with the iPhone4 do.  It serves its purpose of blocking direct hand contact with the phone so your signal strength does not drop but probably does little to protect the phone against a fall.  I agree with other reviewers - if you own an iPhone 4 then you can afford a better case than this.  I can't see any reason why I would buy this case.",3
"I've had my iPhone for less than a year, and before getting this case, I'd already tried 4 different cases. 3 of those cases were the soft body kind comparative to the AmazonBasics Silicone case. I feel that it is most similar to the Speck PixelSkin HD I got from the free case program. The PixelSkin and the AmazonBasics cases are both equivalent in price, they are both soft cases that add little weight to the phone, and they both have the textured back for better grip and style. Of the two I prefer the AmazonBasics case for the following reasons:+I like the feel of the material much better. The PixelSkin material is unobtrusive and unremarkable. The AmazonBasics case, on the other hand, feels nice to touch. It has a kind of smooth, soft feel to it. It is also more elastic than the PixalSkin, which is both a pro and a con. On the one hand, it makes it really easy to put on. On the other hand, it makes it really easy to take off. My fear of the phone falling out of its case is probably unfounded, but it is something I will keep an eye on in the future.+I prefer the holes for the buttons. It makes them easier to push.+I like the ripple design of this case better than the pixel design of the PixelSkin+Its RED!!! Black is nice, but I like the variety of colors that the AmazonBasics case offers.Other notes:The hole in the back confused me until I put it on the phone. Now you can show your Apple logo with pride!The particular version of the case that I got did not come with any sort of screen protector, but it looks like Amazon has combined the reviews for this version with a version that comes with a screen protecter, so several reviewers remark on the screen protecter. Check the product details closely!This is a soft case and will thus offer less protection than a hard shell case. If you are looking for a hard shell case, I recommend theSpeck Products Fitted Case for iPhone 4 (Black/Grey) (Fits AT&T; iPhone), which is probably my favorite iPhone case.The kind of stickiness of the case means that if you put it in your pocket, or purse, it's less likely to slide out. This also means it's harder to slide into pockets, of course.Update Note August '12:After about 6 months of use, the case has stretched out. It falls off the edges and I really can't use it anymore. Still, I liked it while it lasted, and for the price, I think it did great.",4
"The silicone is nice.  Was flexible and completely covered the iPhone as advertised.  In fact, all of the openings were correct and I had no trouble with access to the charger/synch cable or any other exterior access.  It does seem to pickup lint when in my pocket, but is easily wiped off.Very satisfied.  One note, the color of the one I received was more 'pink-ish' than red.  It could just be a dye issue, but it is still a very capable protective device.",5
"I think as far as skin type cases go this is a good one.  It's not cheap and flimsy like some are.  I still have a problem with skins though and this type of phone, especially with kids and pockets. The skins (and pretty much ALL do this) tend to move and get caught and their flexibility tends to be a kid magnet and I have had several tear from kids fidgeting with them (although not this one).  If you like skins, then buy without concern, but I prefer a harder case.",4
"It's annoying how expensive iPhone cases are. Thankfully, AmazonBasics provides an inexpensive and totally adequate alternative. Provided you don't want something fancy, this is a great case. It fits perfectly, it's easy to pull on and off, and it provides enough room around the connectors so that if you have a non-Apple cable or something that has a different sized casing, you'll be fine. Highly recommended!",5
This case is afordable fits perfectly and feels geat! I have one in pink and one in white! That's how much I love it!,5
"My favorite case is Speck PixelSkin Rubberized Case.  In comparison for functionality and quality, his AmazonBasics Silicone Case just doesn't live up to my expectations.It makes an okay 'shell' for the phone.  It's very thin.  It doesn't slip on the surface of the table or inside the pocket.  And it grips the phone fine.  That's all there is to me.  My expectation for a case is protection. With the Speck case, dropping my phone isn't the worst nightmare as it provides such a thick cushion for the phone.  And it grips the phone tightly and fits perfectly. So, this AmazonBasics product is okay and only acceptable to me.  It only provides the non-slip and anti-scratch protection to the phone.",3
"I prefer semi-soft cases like this, they seem to take shape better to the iphone. great little case, no complaints.",5
"This is my third generation iPhone [iPhone4] and it's the only one I've managed to not shatter the screen on. After many shatters, I started using an otter box case, which I like, but it's a little boxy to fit into my wrist purse or back pocket. However, this silicone case from Amazon has proven to not only hold up against dozens of drops or throws [from the kids], but is skinny enough to slide into a pocket or my wrist purse. It's a great color and I found a amazon headset that matches the color perfectly. It doesn't collect dirt or lent, stays on well and unlike another silicone one I've used---it doesn't stretch out and stop fitting. Highly recommend this one, especially for the price.",5
"I currently use anIncipio HOT PINK Feather Case Cover for Apple iPhone 4 (Fits AT&T; iPhone)and love the case.  It protects my phone well from bumps, drops, dust, etc.  However, it definitely ads bulk and weight to the phone, so I was curious to try something more lightweight to see how the experience would compare.Accordingly I tried this case and absolutely hated it.  It was only two days before I went back to the case I mentioned above.  At first I liked that the case was very lightweight and thin so it didn't add weight or bulk to the phone.  I also like that it had a slightly grippy texture on the outside so it can stay someplace like a car dashboard without sliding too much.  Neither of these things made up for what I didn't like about the case though.My biggest problem is that it is not structured at all so the case kind of slides around, especially if you are a woman and have it hanging out in your purse.  I often found change, dust, etc. had worked its way into the case making me feel like my phone was barely protected.  I also didn't like that when handling it the case easily slipped around, bending every which way.  In addition to being annoying and allowing the phone to get dirty, it made me doubt whether the phone would be truly protected if it were to fall.I've liked a lot of the Amazon Basics products, but I'm sorry, this is NOT one of them.  I don't recommend this at all.",1
"If you are like me and just want a basic good looking case for your iPhone that will provide protection from the occasional drop, this is the case for you. It actually looks very nice on the phone, is comfortable to hold, doesn't block any of the ports, and will offer great protection. A solid buy !",4
"When my wife received her iPhone4 she was ecstatic.  She was one of those people like in the commercial that was waiting forever for it to come to Verizon.  So when it finally came she was not disappointed.  But now a new dilemma presented itself - there are about a billion different products for the iPhone and some are created for the AT&T version and some for the Verizon version.  This silicone case ended up being a good find since it did not add extraneous bulk or weight to her phone, but yet provided a level of protection against minor bumps and scratches.  Most importantly, it also precluded her from the dreaded signal disappearance by the wandering pinky. The silicone itself helps to prevent it from slipping on many surfaces and has additional grooves molded in the back to help improve its grip.  And of course, having a pink one helped to give her a level of distinction and envy in the office.  I would say that the only minus part is that it has a big Amazon logo branded on the back.  Since it is molded into the skin, it is hard to see from afar, but very visible up close.  Depending upon your preferences, this can be annoying.  But if simple and cheap is what you are after, it is hard to beat.",4
"It's a peppy pink, which is distinctive and makes my phone stand apart. This basic case has protection for the back of the iPhone, and provides bumpers for the sides. It allows for good access to its ports and controls. The ribbed, textured feel is pleasant in my hands, and offers a good grip. My only complaint is its fit; the sides are slightly too loose. The price is right, however, for a backup case.",4
"I read all the other reviews and decided to purchase this product regardless to what I had read. This is a perfectly simple silicone case. It has been ridiculously hard to find a case similar to this. I love this case, your paying 4.99 for something you'd have to pay over 15.00 elsewhere. In some areas it could fit a little tighter but it's not like this case could just fall off. Worth the money, great buy!",5
"Around our house, we have all kinds of iPhones and iTouches.  I can identify my 13 year old daughter's (purchased with babysitting money) by her various stylish cases.  However, neither my husband nor I use a case, and I can never tell which one is mine.  So when the AMAZONBASICS SILICONE CASE FOR AT&T; AND VERIZON IPHONE 4 (in pink) became available, I grabbed it up.  Now, my iPhone is pretty in pink, easily identifiable and easy to find.  And the AMAZONBASICS SILICONE CASE FOR AT&T; AND VERIZON IPHONE 4 also offers some protection when my 5 year old drops it on the floor.The AMAZONBASICS SILICONE CASE FOR AT&T; AND VERIZON IPHONE 4 has a nice form factor, and has the openings needed for all the various ports and buttons.  It provides my hand a firm grip, which is nice considering how often my youngest daughter or I drop it.  And it is light-weight and fairly slim, so it doesn't add to the bulk of the already hefty iPhone.The one drawback of the AMAZONBASICS SILICONE CASE FOR AT&T; AND VERIZON IPHONE 4 is that it does not fit as tightly as I would like.  While it covers what it should cover and has openings where it should have openings, it just misses fitting snuggly enough.  It occasionally gaps and puckers around the edges.  If I had to guess I would say that the measurements in each direction are just a millimeter or two off in each direction.Overall, the AMAZONBASICS SILICONE CASE FOR AT&T; AND VERIZON IPHONE 4 is a very nice case, especially for the sale price, and it helps me easily identify my phone in a house full of gadgets, but I really do wish that it fit a bit better.",3
"This case is made from thick silicone, and provides adequate protection for most responsible users. It is easy to slip on and off, good for people who use other cases (such as a charging case). I have been using it for weeks and have not had a problem with it coming off unintentionally, but it is quite loose on the longer sides. I find it very comfortable to hold in my hand as I use my phone, and it provides a good amount of traction so it doesn't easily slip off surfaces. Is it the best case of all time? No. But it's a good value, and extremely functional.",4
"I was very happy to receive this product for review.  My normal case is a much harder plastic, which is actually difficult to remove from my phone.  I like the opening for the volume buttons and camera, rather than covering those areas as my other case did.  I also really love the look of the case - the pink is not too 'hot' and the circular design on the rear side of the case looks cute and makes for a great grip.  The best thing about the case is the price - a great value for less than half the cost of others I've seen.  I'll be shopping for it in other colors!",4
"This product just looks cheap. I mean c'mon! if someone can afford to have the iphone4, they can afford a quality case also, something that will look good. Not this cheap looking case with cheap material and ugly pink color.",2
"Well, what can I say - it's silicone, it fits, so I guess it's pretty good.  The gorgeous shade of pink is an extra bonus, since that's my favorite color.  It really doesn't make sense to carry your iphone or ipod touch around without a silicone case - one drop and it can be permanently ruined - hopefully the silicone cases will offer enough protection to prevent any major damage from happening.",5
"When it comes to skins it basically comes down to how much you want to pay -- the quality vs cost equation.  For my iTouch, which I've owned for years, I've bought two Speck skins, and it's these I have in mind as I write this review.Compared to the Speck skins, this basic Amazon case is thinner and has a more flexible (less stiff) feel.  Now my first Speck case I finally abandoned because it became too loose over time, so that it didn't fit the iTouch like the-glove-it-was meant-to-be.  This causes me concern when it comes to the Amazon phone-skin because it arrived loose, and I can't imagine how that can improve with age.THE SKINNY:::If you don't have a bunch of case to throw around you might want to consider this case.  I think I'd spend more, but I don't abandon my technology very frequently so extra durability makes sense for me.Personally, I found the fit to be on the loose side.  My only real complaint.I do like that the case provides protection for the phone, and that it's available in a ton of colors.All of the cut-outs are in the right place.**2.5-Stars**Pam T~mom/blogger",3
"This is a basic silicone case that's good for protecting against nicks and scratches on the iPhone's body. The screen is still unprotected, so if that's a concern you should pick up a screen protector too. Remember, this isn't a heavy duty case like an Otterbox -- dropping your phone on concrete will likely result in a crack even with this case on.As a bonus, this case (like any other case) helps with the iPhone's attenuations problems (i.e. the grip of death). While the antenna problems aren't as pronounced due to Verizon's stronger network, they still happen. This case prevents that issue.On the downside, the material picks up dust and pocket lint easily. It can be rinsed off with water easily, but you'll have to do that more often than you like.For the price, this case offers very basic protection. Personally, I suggest either going 'naked' with the phone or getting something heavy duty like an Otterbox.",3
"This is a great little budget case without any bells and whistles. It comes in a simple to open package and it's got holes in everywhere you need it.I wouldn't trust that it's going to absorb any sort of shock when the iPhone hits the floor, but it should keep it from getting scrapped a little bit.Of course there's no screen protector included, it's just the little case.The pink color is bright and makes the phone stand out. Not colorful enough to be a conversation starter, but very, very pink.There's an interesting, textured pattern on the back of the case. It's a swirly pattern that is kind of cool. It also has the Amazon Basics logo stamped in the bottom corner of the back of the phone. So everybody knows where you bought it and knows that you got it for cheap. Of course, if you're serious about saving some cash... Then you really don't care.I gave it 5 stars based on being a budget case that does what it says. It's not really fancy because it's just as the name implies - Basic. If you want something that's going to absorb any shock - don't bother here.One minor caveat though - After a few weeks of usage there's one aspect that I am not impressed with. One side of the case does not lay completely lay flat against the side of the phone. It bulges out ever so slightly. This is a small, but annoying problem. I have waited patiently for it to form to the phone but it still bulges out slightly to the side. This minor flaw would probably keep me from buying another one if I had any considerations other than price.",5
"I really like this case. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the side felt a little flimsy when I would swipe my thumb (unlocking or moving aps around) and it collected a lot of dirt on the back.Overall it's fantastic given the price. It provides adequate protection, a nice tactile feel (not too sticky so it slides in your pocket, but not too little texture that you worry you'll drop it).Nice job amazon!",4
"If the main reason you have an iPhone is its crystal-clear sound and you don't care one bit about 'looks' and you are afraid that you might drop it one day and you don't mind the 'sticky' silicone skin trapping lint/small debris between 'it' and the body of your iPhone then this case is definitely IT. Anyone who doesn't fall into the above class would not want one. The (white in my case) thick silicone case with a ribbed back clashes violently with iPhone's sleek, elegant design. It makes it thicker/bulkier and it succeeds in almost completely hiding iPhone's iPhoneness, turning it into cheap-looking iSore.This product qualifies for the 2-star rating, meaning 'I don't like it'. It's not a terrible product because it fits the G4 like a glove and not everyone will dislike it but it's not for me and, based on my unscientific survey - off 3 other iPhone owners only one agree to even try it for a day and that person would not buy one after trying mine - most iPhone users seem to agree.P.S. - it does not fit the iPhone G3.",2
"I absolutely loved the case at first - I loved the color, the texture and the way it fit my phone so well. I haven't had a silicone case before that has been such a great fit for a phone. I have had a hard plastic case on my phone since I purchased it, so the soft case was a pleasant change. I did think the white was a bit dingy looking when I got it - it wasn't a glaring white (like bleached teeth or something lol). I didn't worry too much as I expected within a few weeks it would get a bit dirty anyway and no one would notice.However I've gone back to my old hard shell plastic case. The only reason why I went back to my old case now was because I was not 100% thrilled that the case left the buttons on the side as well as on the top of the phone exposed. It makes me nervous thinking I am going to scratch them. For the cost of these phones I want 100% protection on every exposed part I can get!So fine for a spare and that's the way I'll use it or if i just want a change for a few days but for protection (which is, after all, why I want a case - I don't really care how the phone looks) I'm sticking with one that covers more.",3
"It really does what it is ment to do.  The right Edge,near the volume keys is always kind of lose... is not to tight.Actully it fits well except for the right edge, for me is to lose.regards.",3
"I recently got the iPhone 4 for Verizon, so I decided to check out this silicone case to see if I would prefer it to a harder shell.  While I think I'm probably going to end up with the plastic shell, I would recommend this piece for those looking for a rubber sleeve.  The case is solidly made and protects the phone well (I've already dropped my iPhone once and this dead well to hold it).  My only complaints with it are that it slips too easily when inserting/removing the iPhone from a pocket.  It also is very grabby with dust & dirt, so I'm often wiping it off to keep it clean.Other than that, however, it's a very good item for those looking to protect their electronic investment, especially for the low price.-AP3-",4
"This case is pretty much perfect in every way and I love this line of AmazonBasics.The case is soft and very well fitting with openings for all of the necessary opennings.  Also, it doesn't cost a fortune - it's the perfect product at the perfect price shipped in perfect 'frustration free' packaging.I can't say enough great things about this.  You should know though that this has no kind of faceplate protection - it's just a sleeve.  I put a screen protector transparent sheet on my iphone and combined with this case, it's perfect.  It is most definitely a minimalist case though.It also solves the attenuation problems that occur when you hold a bare iphone in just the right way.Thx Amazon and a BIG THANK YOU for this line of necessary products priced a reasonable price.",5
I found this case to be made of high quality silicone.  While it is on the phone I found it very easy to hold the phone.  I think it is very important to protect my iphone from scratches if it falls or in normal use and this case does the job.  I would say this case is exactly what you would expect when you purchase one.  The only thing I would like is for the case to fit a little more snugly.,4
"This is just what it says it is.  It's a basic white silicone case for the iPhone 4.  It arrived in basic Amazon packaging, not the blister pack mess.  I had no trouble fitting it on the iPhone and it's got a good fit.  I have been using this for about one month and although it has not stretched, I suspect that it might in time.  I will update this review if that does happen.  Regardless, the only other possible flaw is that the silicone seems to stick to my pocket when I'm trying to put it in my jeans pocket.  It's a minor gripe for an overall solid case.",5
"AmazonBasics White Silicone Case for iPhone 4Silicone is used for everything these days from soft baby products and grippy stationery items to heat-resistant kitchen gadgets. It provides good rubbery protection. It's wonderfully soft to the touch and is very flexible. Since the introduction of the first iPods, case makers have used silicone to fashion all manner of colorful, useful cases. However, the way an iPhone is actually used on a day-to-day basis presents a different set of requirements - yes, protection is vitally important, but a phone is touched, gripped and held hundreds of times each day. It is jammed in and out of pockets, purses and briefcases, it's used in cars as well as out on the street. All mobile phones tend to be treated pretty roughly. For me, silicone is just too flimsy and flexible for an iPhone case and I suspect that a silicone iPad case would suffer the same shortcomings. The biggest requirement for a mobile phone case is the durability to withstand nearly constant use. Unfortunately, silicone doesn't fit this requirement the way it does so well for an iPod. The AmazonBasics iPhone case is very nicely designed and the white color satisfies those who wanted a white iPhone, but it doesn't quite fit the phone tightly enough. The sides bow outward due to this. If you are a light user, this may be right for you but in my experience, I prefer something more robust. I can only give a so-so rating to this case.",2
"The quality of the case if good, but the problem is the fit.  It doesn't firmly fit my iphone 4 and makes it kind of loose.",3
"If you are looking for a simple case for your iPhone this is it. It is very thin and the silicone covers all of the important areas and leaves what has to be exposed open. The back of the case has a nice spiral design and is open at the apple logo. It adds very minimal bulk to the iphone, and is very light, which I really like. Of course, this is a white model and tends to show any dust or other stuff that might latch on in a pocket more easily. The silicone make for a nice grip surface, along with the textured back.The best thing about this case is the price. You can't beat it for a basic case for your iPhone.",4
"I am used to a much bigger Ballistic case that completely encloses the phone has a built in screen protector, a belt clip and a thick silicone case over a plastic shell.  A downside of such a case is that it hides your phone away such that I've had people ask me what kind of giant phone I have.With the Amazon Basics iPhone 4 case (white) it is a different story.  It is a simple, thin, silicone sleeve that leaves the front of the phone as well as the various buttons, holes and speakers open.  The basic upshot of this is that it provides some protection for your phone - mainly from scratches to the back and sides - but preserves the sleek look of your iPhone.  And the case itself feels nice - soft and smooth with a circular ridged design on the back centered on the Apple logo.As far as the amount of impact protection provided it is hard to say without, you know, throwing my iPhone to the ground which I'm not about to do.  It's a thin case but I'm sure it will protect it from minor drops but more than that I'm not so sure about.  And again, it is very open with nothing covering the buttons and jacks and all so it really is very basic protection.In the end I give it an average score.  Protection is important to me and so is a belt clip which is not available with this case.  And without adding a separate screen protector I'm afraid that scratches would eventually form on the screen if carrying around in your pocket or a bag for long periods of time.  If serious protection is not a big concern for you then consider this above average as it is sleek and shows off your iPhone well.",3
"This is ok and does protect the phone when you lay it down on a table, etc.  However, I find the rubber is just a little too loose. It isn't doesn't quite 'fit like a glove' as I was expecting. When you pull it out of say your jean pocket, it has a tendency to pull off bit and you have to push it back on. If it was just a tad smaller it would be perfect.",3
"This is a good basic iphone case. I like the curved design on the back and it provides decent coverage to keep your iphone safe from scratches and drops. I wish the silicone was a little thicker so that it didn't feel so flimsy. I like that it has a circle in the back to see the apple logo, but it does get a little dirty in the crevices. I would recommend buying an additional screen cover on top of this. Overall its a steal for the price and what it offers you. everyone should put cases on their phones.",5
"Got this for the wife's new Verizon iPhone 4 and and she's very pleased with it. It a simple piece of silicone but it's easy to put on, fits nicely, and seems to offer adequete protection. It doesn't really do anymore than that so there's not much else to say.",5
"I think the look of this case really detracts from the design of the iPhone. It feels cheap and a bit rigid, almost like plastic. It's a bit sticky, so it's annoying to slide in and out of pockets. The back is ridiculously ugly, with the circle pattern and the visible AmazonBasics logo on the corner. No thanks.",2
"This is an attactive soft plastic case with a hole in the back for the apple logo to be displayed. But, if you carry your phone in your pants pocket the combination of the non-slip silicone and loose fit guarantees that when you put the phone in your pocket the case will grip the pocket sides and you'll pull the phone out of the case.It does help considerably with the iPhone deadly droped calls.",3
"The case feels flimsy and the fit is a little loose, especially around the left side buttons and top. The cut outs are appropriate, although the back cutout for the Apple logo is unnecessary.I prefer the Speck PixelSkin HD. The Speck is firmer, has better grip texture, fits tighter, and only has cut outs that are absolutely necessary (the push buttons are all covered).",2
"This Amazon branded silicon case is a good quality case and fits the iPhone nicely. It might protect from light impacts, which is a big deal - pretty much the major draw to buying a basic silicon wrap. It's ideal protection from the scuffs and chips which might come about from everyday use, so it's definitely a good value.The large circular-pattern texture on the back is pretty nice aesthetically. A circular cutout on the back allows others to see that you own an Apple iPhone, for whatever reason.On the minus side, the volume and power buttons are left exposed to potentially dirty fingers which could lead to dirt buildup within these openings of the phone. I'd prefer these be covered.",3
"There are quite a few products that the 'Amazon Basics' brand have dipped into over the past few years, and most all of it is of high quality with a good price.  Unfortunately, this iPhone case is of shoddy quality, and does the rest of the brand a disservice.Mainly, this case is extremely light weight, and doesn't even fit right.  If you were to drop your phone I don't see how this thing would protect it all.  There are so many other durable cases out there for a just a little bit more money making this case a complete waste of time and money.  The case is very thin, and you'd be hard-pressed to see a way to protect anything with it.  The case is too slack for the phone as well, making it so a good fit is impossible.  It bends and creases all over, and I have to wonder who in their right mind wants a case that doesn't even fit their phone in the first place.  If aesthetics is important to you in a case, this is about the worst choice you could make.I hate knocking an 'Amazon Basics' brand, but the truth needs to be told about this case.  There are countless other affordable options on the market that will protect your phone, and look good while doing it.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this.",1
I usually buy my cases on eBay since they are cheap. I find it hard to spend more than $10 on a case for my iPhone and I like variety in my cases. That said let's get into the review. The white case is a nice touch for those of you who have been wanting that white iPhone. I an fortunate enough to have both a white and black iPhone 4 (look at the pics so you can see what this case looks like with both iPhones. Just know the white iPhones should be released very soon. So I hope the images and the review help.Pros:*Easy installation*light weight*Better quality than eBay specialsCons:*fairly expensive compared to eBay specials*Not as protective as 'hard' cases*Hole in the back (circular cut out allows for potential scratching.All in all 3/5 stars. Certainly not the cheapest case out there in terms of price and construction. But if you are willing to fork over $15 you may as well add a few more dollars for an otterbox case.,3
This case is really loose on the iPhone 4S. It adds the required 'grippiness' but doesn't really keep much junk from getting to the phone. The port and button cut-outs do work for the Verizon 4S model.,2
"This is a typical soft silicone case for the iPhone 4.  Nothing too special, but the circle design on the back is interesting, just wish it covered up the entire back without the cutout to show the Apple logo.  Like most silicone cases it doesn't fit tightly and will slip off occasionally when I pull it out of my pocket.  It is also grippy, which is good when you holding it and bad when you are trying to jam it into your pocket.",4
"There is not much to gloat about on this case.  Much like all of the cheap imports it is the most basic thing you can find.  It gets the job done while maintaining a very reasonable price point.  If you're a casual iphone user I would recommend this.  If you foresee using your iPhone on a regular basis in a pocket, rugged environment, or leaving it out, i would steer you towards a better case like an otterbox.If you're looking for a phone case to keep the occasional scuff or scrape then this is it.Plus amazon offers PRIME shipping on their products so it beats having to buy it from a third party vendor and pay shipping charges.You should know though that you can probably walk into any mall in america and get the same thing with the same quality without the wait.",4
"This is a nice, clean, minimalist case. It accentuates the solid feel of the beautiful iPhone 4. The problem I have with this case, however, is that it gives too easily in the front along the side edges. It's not like the case pops off, but the sides move too easily. If in a pocket, pulling out the phone opens these gaps, so any grit (dried laundry detergent, lint, sand, pet hair) gets in there, and sometimes behind the phone... which can lead to scratching by forcing a foreign object to rub in the same place by way of the back of the case. It's a nice alternative to waiting an eternity for Apple to come out with the white iPhone. I'm a big fan of Apple and the beautiful Apple logo, but the case would have better suited as a protective case if the viewing area for the logo was not an actual hole, but a clear (or more transparent) piece of silicone. Picking out a case is like picking out a car. For some people, it is purely a means to an end, for others, it takes a lot of thought and preparation. This case does not protect the front of the phone, so if you drop it face down on something pointy like a hard end table, you're likely going to shatter the glass... but for those who don't want to fiddle with a flap or other front covering, the case does offer a more secure grip.",3
"This is my first experience with a silicone case. If you like silicone cases, this is a great silicone case, but after using this product I'm not a fan of silicone cases.It fits the iPhone 4 Verizon very well. Provides good grip and pretty much eliminates unintentional sliding out of a pocket. It is lightweight and thin. It has good access to all ports, cameras, and controls.However, as with any silicone product, the good grip comes with the negative of making it difficult to slide into or out of a pocket. Plus, it is so soft that it can inadvertently peel off when inserting or removing from a pocket.",3
"This is a servicable case for an AT&T; iPhone 4, though buyers may wish to hold off on buying one of these cases for use with one of the Verizon model iPhone 4 units until *after* confirming this case would work with those as there are said to be minor differences in the alignment of buttons between the two telco's iPhone products.I say servicable case because, well, it is.  This is an AmazonBasics product and it is pretty basic, with that said, you really don't need a very fancy case for the phone if all you are looking to do is protect it's skin (shell) and/or make it less slippery and less likely to go flying out of your hands.I joked with a friend that getting this White case, or another White case is the only current way to get the long delayed White iPhone.  (Seriously, what is taking Apple so long to get those units out??)  At least with this case you can change the color of the iPhone pretty easily :-pIn ordering this case I had a couple of questions that I can now answer for others that are interested.  First up, I wondered whether or not putting this case on the iPhone 4 would mean that I couldn't slide this case into the holster type case I like to use (Leather Pouch Protective Carrying Cell Phone Case for Apple iPhone 4 16GB 32GB / 3GS - 16GB 32GB 3G - 8GB / Garmin Asus Garminfone / HTC myTouch (2010) T-Mobile HTC Hero / Huawei Ascend Cricket/ LG Optimus T T-Mobile Optimus S Sprint / Motorola Droid 2 ...).  The answer to that is no, even with this case on the phone I can easily slide the phone into and out of the holster that I wear on my waist.  Granted, the holster I'm currently using is well broken in and that may help, but I don't expect any problems really as this case doesn't add that much extra thickness to the iPhone 4.The next question was on the fit for this case when it is installed on the phone.  In that area I've had to knock this case down a few stars.  It fits ok, but only ok.  In fact it is a little loose, at least on mine, around the button area (volume and mute toggle button) and is pretty much bulging on that long edge.  Since this case isn't that stiff, unlike theINCASE snap case iphone 4that Apple gave me as part of their cure for the iPhone deathgrip issue, it doesn't surprise me that much, but is still a little disappointing that it doesn't fit a little better or more snug.One disadvantage to this case is that it offers no 'stand' mechanism/attachment, unlike that incase that I've referenced above.  If you like to prop your iPhone up for watching media on, that case has a definite advantage compared to this one.Another case that I had bought and used was theSpeck Products Fitted Case for iPhone 4 (Black/White Plaid) (Fits AT&T; iPhone)(though mine had a green and white pattern on the back).  This AmazonBasics case is somewhat similar to that case in that the back area of the case (where the camera lens and Apple logo are to be found) has a different texture to it that is designed to help keep the phone (while in the case) from easily sliding off a table top or other surface.  With the Speck case it is a cloth back with a material that is somewhat like denim or canvas, with this AmazonBasics Silicon case the back is still silicone but has a raised texture that makes it tend to grip a hard surface somewhat like good tires on pavement.Another comment about the protective nature of this case versus either of the other cases I've used.  With my incase the case itself is a bit more slick and might be more easily knocked off a surface which leads me to question how protective the case would be if the whole thing hit the floor.  I honestly don't know the answer to the question and hope to never *need* to know the answer to the question, but in looking at that plastic case and how stiff it is, I'm not sure I can really expect all that much protection for the phone within.  I have had the phone hit the floor once or twice, but it's been on carpet each time and no damage has occured.  This Amazon basics case is softer, but perhaps a little thicker and seems as if it might cushion a blow a little better than the incase would.In current comparison shopping it appears that this Amazon basics case is at a reasonable point in the greater marketplace.  It's not out of the range that other competing products fall into and offers a reasonable product to those that want one.",3
"A very basic silicone cover. Inexpensive, looks & feels nice. Does offer a small level of protection over no case at all. Most would be better served in spending a bit more and getting a more robust cover.",3
I have a black iPhone 4 and this case frames it perfectly.  It's thick without being too thick.  It's sticky on surfaces without attracting lint and dirt.  And the cut-out for Apple logo is much appreciated since many cases do not take that extra step.  Definitely a great achievement for Amazon Basics.,5
"The Otterbox Defender is fantastic! It gives me the security to allow my grandkids to play with my phone, without any fear of them dropping it. Yes, they do, and it is just fine.I thought the white case would be a problem, but I was totally wrong! Grimy fingerprints wipe right off, there is no dirt showing on mine after 2 years of use, on a farm, crammed into my pocket, falling on the ground, shoved into a bag, still perfectly white!I did switch out the white interior case for a pink one, giving me a very cool white phone with pink accents. I get compliments on it every day.",5
I purchased this so that I would feel comfortable letting my 9 month old daughter interact with my old iPhone 3GS. She really loves to interact with the screen. I only let her play with it for a few minutes every few days since she is only 9 months old :-)  But even though she is only 9 months old the reason I thought to buy this in the first place is that EVERY time I take out my iPhone 4 and she sees the screen she reaches for it and wants to hold it and touch it.This case is definitely tough enough to allow the phone to be tossed around. I'm not sure how high I would want it to be tossed from onto a hard surface but I do think that it would likely survive because of the way it is designed.,4
Maybe........Just Maybe......this will keep my teenage son from wrecking his 3rd Iphone.  If it doesn't we're going with the Survivor brand Iphone cover.  Item was shipped quickly and arrived as described.,5
This case is wonderful.. Just very annoying to wait two weeks to have it shipped only to find it had a scratch on the clear screen.  I would expect it to be perfect if listed as BRAND NEW condition.  It also appeared to be dirty and had lots of smears on the screen that had to be cleaned before I could even use it.  Also the cover flap that fits over the silencer will barely stay closed.  Other than that I love Otterbox products and highly recommend them to everyone who wants nothing but the best protection out there for their iphone!,3
Love this case and the built in screen protector. Sturdy and protects the phone on a whole notha level. Would recommend.,5
"Despite not really liking the overall look and 'bulk' of the Otterbox cases; I ordered this to protect my phone from damage. Everyone raves about how well these cases protect your phones so I figured I could sacrifice looks to avoid the expense of replacing my iPhone.  However; I did order another rubber outer case from a different company in purple, since Otterbox does not offer that color.  My review on that is out here on Amazon as well.I agree with all other reviews that this case will protect your phone.  If that is your main goal you won't be disappointed.  The few 'cons' I have against this are as follows.The white plastic hard case actually has a bit of a pink tinge to it which is very noticeable against the white rubber outer cover.  Since I replaced my rubber cover with a purple one; it is not noticeable but I thought anyone intending to keep the 'white with white' should know.The screen protecting shield is built into the hard plastic case. This is good to protect your screen from scratches but it does take some getting used to. I have never had a screen protector on my phones before. There is a very slight gap between the protector and the actual front of your phone so any touch or dragging you do ends up leaving a weird, 'water mark' like reflection on the front of the screen. If you tilt your phone a certain way you can see a pinkish-green 'smudge'.  This bugged me. Doing some research online I discovered this is a common problem.  One solution is to actually ADD a little grease to the screen on your phone and to the inside plastic screen protector. More grease, say, just from your fingertips should create a 'bond' that will prevent this reflective smudge.  DIDN'T WORK FOR ME.Solution number two also found online, the exact opposite suggestion.  Lightly dust the front of your phone and the inside of the protector with some translucent face powder. The Youtube video I saw used a compact, not loose powder.  That works; for a time.  Downside of this solution is it makes it much harder to see the screen in sunlight. The coating of face powder reflects the light ( as most of us ladies want it to do on our faces).  And no matter how evenly or lightly you dust the powder, in the sunlight it just looks like a dirty, dusty phone.  And after about 4-6 weeks I found I needed to remove the cover, clean the phone, clean the inside of the cover and 're-dust' because the weird smudges were happening again.All in all a great protective cover that I can highly recommend. Maybe if you are used to screen protectors this 'water-mark' smudgy business won't bother you.",4
Love the color. fits my iphone 3gs perfectly. screen protector sucks but other than that it protects my phone great and i haven't had an issue yet.,5
"works great paint rubbed off the corners but overall not bad. would buy again. , . . . . .",4
"I bought this case for my mom awhile back. She liked it a lot, but the way that it shows on the phone, it is not pink, it is purple. Which was a drawback. It is a rubberized case with little to no protection. If you are looking for a &#34;fashion&#34; case, this is it.It is nice for the price, but overall quality is alright. Go for more of a protective case. It is worth it to spend a little more, especially on amazon.",4
Fits great! The case is clear so if your phone is white like mine it will not look like the pic.,4
Looks purple not pink but its still cute. I adore the zebra pattern action going on. Fits good. No complaints,5
"Definitely one of the best covers I've ever purchased for a phone! Perfect fit, great look and overall worth the buy! Fits nice and snug and I've yet to have a problem with it coming off my phone, as I've had that problem in the past with too bulky or big of cases; it stays on just as it should and is easy to take off. I purchased two of these, one for myself and another for a friend, and she agrees that this is a great case!",5
Love this case.  My phone is white so it ends up being a pink zebra print which I absolutely adore.  The fit is perfect.  Very snug and will not fall off easily like the cheap rubbery one that I have been using.  I dropped the phone on hardwood floor by accident and it remained intact.  If you love this print then I highly recommend this.,5
good case for the phone the color is off a little but the dealer is very easy to work with. shipping was on time and fits the phone well,4
I really like this phone cover. It looks very cute and the silicon protects my phone. It doesn't look like the picture it's not hot pink it's more like a mix of purple and pink. It's still cute though.,4
This gel skin is exactly what I needed. Slips easily in and out of my pocket. Will be buying more for my phone to have different styles and colors.,5
Okay so i got the case right and i had the white evo so this case looked terrible. Maybe it looks good with the black but this protective cover is not durable. Its like a regular skin nothing special about it. Please don't be fooled. But it did ship fast so that was the only good thing.,1
Its super cute. I love the fact that its like a jelly shoe for my phone. I love the overall look and feel of it.,5
"I have not wanted nor needed to buy a case since. Love that the design doesn't scratch off, doesn't ever look dirty, lasts FOREVER, and best off all the material allows it to slip in and out of your pocket/purse without hassle or picking up dirt particles. Best phone cover ever!",5
but the color of your phone will eventually slowly seep into the clear plastic and if you change your battery a lot like I do then it will take a little to get used to the technique of opening the cover so that your screen protector won't be affected overall I do like it it's clear with the zebra stripes you can still see the HTC logo on the back of my phone which is very nice and I did drop it and it did a good job protecting it so no regrets here - for the price it's a great idea,4
"This was not what I expected way too bulky.  Covered most of the touch screen, it was hard to press the home keys for different functions.  Does not look anything near the picture shown on Amazon.com.  I sent mine back for a refund.It will protect your phone, but you sacrifice aesthetics.",2
"If your looking for a simple skin for that cell then go for this one, it's just a cover of sheer with the grasp of protection from the silicone material. TY SLM",5
"Personally, I think this case is good.My problem is that I don't like how thick my captivate is after this case is snapped onto it.The other problem I have is how the price is now a hundred times cheaper. i mean at eight cents??? i got mine for eight bucks! haha.it still is a decent case though.",3
i got this case and since i put it on my phone it really gave me headache it doesnt look very good its bulky so i try to take it off it took me so long to take it off i almost broke my fingernails,2
The case broke within a few days in having it without ever being dropped but even though the parts were broken it helped up until I got a new case.,3
cool case,4
"I had purchased the same product when the Galaxy-S was first in the market and bought this on the basis of that purchase. This time around I was disappointed with this product. The case while it clips shuts easily, removing it is a nightmare and takes some doing. I ended up having to pry it open with a screw drive and damaging the case. This case is also thicker and not as well finished as the previous version. Cannot recommend!",2
"The cover is well designed, fits vibrant exactly, very comfortable. Just put my vibrant and snaps with holders around my phone.",5
"I could have made this better by myself. It doesn't protect the phone, parts of the words are cut off, and it looks like a little kid made it. Very disappointed.",2
case is so easy to break or crack it really is generaic  but it is only good for a  couple days until you find a new case,3
"well,it is a nice cover,work well for long time,I like to use this because can protect my android and I really like it,thank you",5
"I did not know ,how beneficial this item would turn out to be.Great protection for such an incredible low price.",5
"This cover is amazing. I bought the XMatrix Cover for Samsung Vibrant T959 & Galaxy S 4G T959V, Black/Black, but was dissapointed, so decided to try this again, feels much better, bulky, but will protect phone better.",5
Couldn't have fit any better. Snapped on in 2 seconds. The hard rubberized type case is much easier to hold than the plain Galaxy case. The back of the phone is quite slippery and I was afraid that I might drop the phone. Don't waste your money on high priced name brand cases.,5
"I bought this item because I wanted to be able to display the sheer beauty of my Samsung Galaxy S2, this case does it just fine.  However, It doesn't really offer any cushioning from drops and falls, so be careful.  Also, I caught hell trying to remove it once I snapped it into place.  Had me sweating and highly pissed trying to un-snapp it.",5
I have the Samsung Galaxy S2 by Sprint and it looks really good on my phone and actually does protect the phone considering that it's very inexpensive. I would purchase it again if needed.,5
I love this case and the message it states... when things aren't going perfect or I'm going through the many challenges life presents it reminds me that my breakthrough is just aroundthe bend if I hang on and stick w it!!,5
"Good case. Looks good, fits well on my Vibrant. It does have a rubber feel to the case, but it's also almost like a dry/powdery kind of touch...a little strange, but not a deal breaker. I definitely got my money's worth out of this case.",4
"When i saw the picture of this cover on Amazon it looked perfect but when i got it i found there is one major flaw,the 3.5mm jack opening is too small!Before i go any further i want to say that this cover does its job well when it comes to protecting the phone,it snaps on easy and is a perfect fit for the Vibrants shape.The one and only thing that i had a problem with was trying to connect A/V cables to the device while this cover was on,the headphone jack opening looks like it should be big enough but there was no way to make the jack go all the way in with the cover on.The metal part of the jack goes in alright for the most part but won't snap in flush since the plastic surrounding it is being stopped by this cover,this kept the cable from working properly and there was no video signal going out.I had the same issue with some headphones and a wired headset,the opening is just small enough to block the plastic bit of the jack!I do not like the fact that i have to remove the cover every time i want to use video out or listen to music with earbuds,it's a real shame since the cover is nice otherwise.If you do buy this double check to make sure your headphones or A/V cables are going to fit right with this on.Note: The cables i am using (the ones that don't quite go in all the way with the cover on) are these 'RND Power Solutions' Extra Long 3.5mm to RCA Adapter Stereo TV-Out Cable for: Samsung (Captivate i897 and Vibrant T959), Nokia (N8, N86, X6) Smart phones'Hope this helps :)",3
"On the one hand, it provides good protection for the phone.  On the other hand, it was difficult to remove, except when it was dropped and the cover came off.  At the end of the day, it did protect the phone though, and that's why I bought it.",3
This product fit my device perfectly. I would never buy a cell phone case in a store again. This was a great buy for the price. I would have paid more. I would recommend this product to others,5
"I use this as a candy dish at work, not a good fit...  Now I have a new phone so I'm not so unhappy with it...",1
"I ordered this the day after Christmas with another from the same company as a gift? They got here about January 14th which was pretty quick for most oversea shipping.My best friend absolutely loved them, they fit her phone perfectly. I'll update with any issues if she has any.",5
"I was excited to get this phone case last week. The feel of the case is good, the sort of textured-rubber feel makes it much less slippery than the phone itself (why I bought a case) and the fit is perfect. Unfortunately, as many other reviewers pointed out, the plastic tabs that hold the front and back of the case together are poor quality and after only a week the case is falling off of my phone. I don't treat my phone with a heavy hand at all, either. It's either in my hand or sitting on a flat surface, so I'm not tossing it around or treating it roughly. This is just a poor quality case. I read the reviews and thought for the price I'd try it anyway, and I'm not too upset over losing $2, but next time I'll save the $2 and put it towards a little better quality case.",2
"This is a nice rubbery, thin case for the Samsung Vibrant Galaxy 4g. I like that it has good grip without being too tacky (like the rubbery silicon cases). I also like that it is dirt cheap.The case snaps on with a front and back piece very easily. Sometimes it is a bit tough to snap apart for access to the battery/SIM card/SD card area (though I take this as a good sign). I have not had any issues with any damage or material flaking off. I regularly keep the phone in my pocket, so it does get a lot of contact and friction. The case is thin and it has a good feel in my pocket (not too thick). Even with the case on, the phone is about as thick as a non-cased I phone 4.So I would recommend this, especially at the price. It's nothing phenomenal, but it works well and protects the phone (I unfortunately and inadvertently did a toss test one crazy night and it kept the phone in one piece). So yes, it works well even under pressure!3 months and no complaints yet!-------Update: a year later and still works great.  It's not the best looking or highest quality case, but for $2 I can't complain!",5
"Made out of some VERY cheap materiel, just spend a little more money. It also falls apart easy from sitting it down to hard.",1
The case worked as it was supposed to but I can't say that I was impressed in any way. I guess you get what you pay for.,3
"If you just want to have fun covers to change around on your phone you can get this, but it is not good if you want to protect your phone from breakage.  I really get these covers for my 13 year old daughter who is in high school and just loves to change things around.I only gave it a 3 because the cover on this one did not look as good.  Almost as if the paint was coming off. But other than that, my baby girl is satisfied.",3
im sure this would be a great case should it fit your phone. I mistakenly thought this would fit my samsung galaxy player (seeing that they're so close in resemblance) but sadly it did not.,3
I like this cover because I can put whatever picture or design I want to put inside the back of the case.,5
Glad is wasn't  expensive. It doesn't snap together around the top edge securely. Afraid if I dropped my phone it wouldn't be much protection for it.,2
Good item for the price. Fits the phone perfectly. A little bit hard to take off. Looks good and covers back and all sides.,4
perfect fit for samsung galaxy s 4g t959v. not as strong as i thought it will be but for the price i am not complaining. all punched out holes fits prefect on the phone. highly recommended.,5
I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR BUT I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED. I KNOW WHAT I WAS GETTING . . . .. .  .. . .,4
"Just got the cover in the mail & am disappointed. It is not 'RUBBERIZED' at all, just a normal, hard plastic with very bad finishing. eg. If you want to switch on the phone from the side button, you are bound to be scratched up on your thumb/finger, as the sides are so uneven and rough. Save up your money and buy something a little more worth the money. the only plus would be that it's not marked with big cheesy logos.A big no no for this product, atleast for me...",2
I love the case. It is a show stopper. I love tigers so it is something that I always enjoy looking at.,5
"I have dropped my phone a few times while in this case... granted the phone is still alive but the two pieces explode and fly in different directions when this happens. Its really annoying.I would recommend going with a gel case, that will absorb the impact.",2
It won't protect your phone at all if it drops. It's just one of those back pieces that are there for design. It does look good however,3
Perfect fit and speedy shipping.  Fits Sprint Samsung Galaxy 2 like a glove!  Make sure you read the description...my cover was for my Sprint phone and is perfect.  3 stars because I do not like the feel and look of hard acrylic cases...I misread the description-I thought it was silicone.,3
"This fits my phone perfectly, love how it is clear so that you can still see the phone itself. I have not dropped it and dont plan on it so I am not sure how that would hold up but either way I think it looks great on my phone",5
"DIFICULT TO TAKE IT OFF THE PHONE AND THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP AND VERY FRAGILE, BUT WHAT CAN I EXPECT IT FOR THIS PRICE. THIS IS A TEMPORARLY PRODUCT, SO IF YO WANT A DURABLE PRODUCT BUY SOMETHING ELSE.",3
"First of all, it is clear case. If you are used to white, black, yellow and etc colored case, it is a bit different. It feels smooth and protected.This is for Sprint Samsung Galaxy S2, with a slightly bigger screen than other variants , ~4.52, so be careful.I have dropped the phone multiple times with the case on, it protects the phone nicely up to date. So definitely worth the money.",5
I purchased this tiger case because my son's name is Tiger.  It fits well with the Large oversize phone case I purchased at the same time.,3
"Its the back part to your phone, not a case. Still very cute, nevertheless. Looks great with a bumper or see through case.",5
Love this case! iIt is exactly like the picture and soo cool! I've received lots of compliments on it too :),5
"At first, this phone case seemed to be a great investment, but I soon found out it doesn't last. The smooth rubberish? texture of the phone case is great, however, it's easily broken. It only lasted ~ 2 weeks before breaking apart. I guess the price fits the quality. You get what you paid for.",2
It is okay but I won't buy this kind again. I think I am going to return it because I have to take it off if I want to put my phone on my charging dock & I foresee it breaking in that process at some point. It is pretty & if I was going to leave it on 24/7 then it would work for what I bought it for.,3
I very much like this product and it is as expected. I hope to recommend it to my friends who own samsung phones.,5
I was very disappointed when I received this in the mail.  It is really just a piece of very cheap hard plastic.  It would never protect your phone at all.,1
I love this saying and I was excited when I FINALLY got it.. but ..  its just a piece of some tough paper glued on the back. And if u get it wet then ur screwed.,2
"Charger has a hard time staying in the phone with this case on, other than that this case is durable and attractive. I put stickers on my battery cover and this keeps them protected and its stylish.",4
I bought this for my husband. He has used this for one year and it just broke. Not a bad product for the low price.,3
I got this case thinking it would last me. It didnt at all. I was able to get 3 days out of this case before it broke. The case wouldnt even snap on right in the first place.,2
Product is exactly as it looks. It's black plastic that fits perfectly and leaves all the connections exposed. Great that way.Cons:1) it's slippery2) Camera and other small spaces on the screen collect dust and can't clean it without removing the cover.,4
This is such a cute case. I love elephants and this case adds to my collection and I get to carry it with me.,5
This is not a cover for protection. If you own a white S2 and want to see the color. Its perfect. One less star for being quite slippery. Lol..,4
"Very fast sipping,the item in great condition . This item the best  and  great fit with my phone and keep ur phone safe I will buy it more from this seller. Thank you so much seller and have a great business.",4
"The print is really smooth and it's NOT low quality at all, which I was kinda afraid it would be. Love this case!",5
"Where can you find such an item for under $3.00???  Nowhere, well, actually, Amazon!You simply cannot go wrong with this purchase -- the case has a good quality feel to it,sturdy, and I like the texture.  Now, there are certainly better fitting cases out there,and I'm not saying that it doesn't fit, because it does.  Just not as nice as a morecostly one.  But feel free to purchase one, because you can with all the money you'll be saving bypurchasing one of these!!!",5
"I found the plastic used very poor quality, with only a couple of days of use and began to break the hinges have adjustment. I lasted less than a month, being that I had not fallen ill with the team. I really had a bad experience with this product",2
"This is very lightwieght and keeps the phones slim profile while providing a little protection. All the cutouts are perfectly located without covering anything unlike some of the TPU cases that cover the volume or power button. While this case is quite cheap and can possibly break if mishandled, I would absolutely recommend this to everyone. For $3 it can't be beat, because it is the same thing the mall kiosk sells for $15.",5
It fits perfectly and looks great. Was truely a great buy. Thx and I recommend anybody that has a vibrant or galaxy,5
This case is okay. It looks the way it does on your phone just as it does in the photo. I don't know how sturdy the case is because I haven't dropped my phone so it hasn't really been put to the test. My only gripe is that the opening to charge the phone does not accommodate the charger that came with the phone. Luckily I had another charger in the house that did fit. For those of you who may need a new charger. I browsed Amazon and found this one. Notice the shape of the charger that fits into the phone. That is the key.http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-ETA0U60JBEGSTA-Charger-Adapter-MicroUSB/dp/B0049IE70I/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1352415756&sr;=1-1&keywords;=cell+phone+charger,3
I bought this for my daughters first phone and man it has been a LIFE SAVER. She has dropped her phone several times and nothing happened to it because of this case. Thank you so much,5
"My case would not snap completely shut.  The seller was very enthusiastic about sending another case and eventually did; but it took awhile.  In the meantime, I found a different case I liked better.",2
"I guess I thought it would be a clear gel case but its a clear hard case, it looks like my phone doesn't have anything on it at all. Weird",2
"Bought a few of these and it really says style and elegance.  Many funky designs, but then you know it is yours!  Easy to use, arrived safely and in good condition.",5
"I knew I loved the mirror screen protectors, and yes, you can see yourself perfectly in it! When you first apply this product it will give the screen a &#34;rainbow&#34; look. This is only temporary, your eyes have to adjust to the product and in a few days this will go away. It is much easier to apply then normal screen protectors because these are much thicker. After having it for months and months, it obviously became extremely scratched, and chipped, and began to peel. I definitely got good use from it though. WARNING: When you are out in the sun this will reflect off of this like no other, and it will make it nearly impossible to see the screen.",4
Item fits perfect on my iphone 4s & the service was quick: no delays or problems. I will definitely recommend this screen protector to all my iphone users. Great service....,5
"If you need a mirror, and don't mind seeing rainbows wherever you go, this might be right for you. Otherwise, stay away.",3
The back one isn't fully a mirror but its still a little bit reflective and looks good if you want a mirror protector this one is good it comes with two cleaning cloths by the way...,4
It does what it says and protects the front of the phone. The only downside is you have to cut a hole in the sensor otherwise while on a phone call it wont dim.,4
Haven't used them yet but sure when I do it will work as good as the others I have purchased before,5
it does what its supposed to.. however could only put the front cover on because the phone would not fit into my case with both.. makes the phone a bit large.. and cannot see screen outside or in the sun... I ended up taking it off because I was annoyed with not being able to see my screen while outside.,2
"Case fits perfect. Really adds no bulk, and so much easier to hold onto the phone now with this case. I did drop it and it chipped the corner of the case out, but remained intact.Just weak in that corner now. It did it's job protecting phone. It is plastic, it's bound to break if it doesn't hit flat. Very happy with it.I might order a couple more just to have at the price",4
I have since updated my phone and obviously the cover that comes with it.  This product served me well in the time that it was used.Another great product at a great price.,3
"Hey for $3 bucks it's a good deal.  It goes on great and really is skin tight on the phone.  It looks nice and smooth.  I did have a few problems with getting it off easily though.  If youre going to want to take it off from time to time, then I'd buy more then one.  The chances of you cracking it are high imo, as I did with mine.  It also is a lil'bit slippery to the touch, not so much of a 'rubber' feel but more like a felt-rubber.  IMO there are better cases out there for around the same money, but its not a 'bad' case.",3
This a very nice case for a Samsung Fascinate and is one of the best bargains I have ever purchased of any kind.The rubberized hard 2 piece case snaps together over the phone and fits perfectly with no gaps or looseness anywhere unlike the soft silicone case it replaced.  The on/off and volume buttons are recessed just enough that they are never pressed accidentally but easily reached when needed unlike the bare phone as delivered.  The rubber has just enough grip to be able to handle the phone reliably without it sliding from your hand but not sticky enough to pick up lint or make it difficult to slide out of a pocket.  Opening the cover to access the SD card is just a matter of inserting a dime in the provided bottom slot and twisting gently to open the clips enough to proceed sequentially around the perimiter in a similar manner until all of the clips are released.  It takes about 30 seconds to open and snaps right back together in 5 seconds afterwords.,5
"I love my Samsung Fascinate, but can we say 'flimsy'?  Its plastic is very light, but the phone itself is terrific.This case is absolutely wonderful, and almost satisfies my iPhone envy.  It gives bulk to the phone, and the rubberized texture ensures that I can hold it even if my hands are sweaty.  All of the exterior controls and ports are accessible - the cover doesn't interfere in the least.I've used both silicone and leather cases in the past, and (I know this sounds sooo cheesy) but I really feel that this one is the best I've ever used for a phone.Any cons would be that once it's on, it's harder than hell to remove, and you'll probably have to use a device (I used a metal cuticle stick because it's thin), and be very careful about snapping everything into place.  That's not the cover's fault ... that was me. The cover was meant to go on once and stay there.Along with theREALOOK Verizon Samsung Fascinate Crystal Clear Premium LCD Screen Protector 2 Packit makes sure that a phone that's a little, um, *delicate* is well protected.",5
"Pros: Great value, very functional.Cons: It's not particularly high in quality. After six months of everyday use, the two halves of the item ceased to completely seal to one another. Also, the coating had worn off over much of the surface.I just bought two more because they are so inexpensive. The coating is only slightly 'grippy' - to me, this is a good thing because it's easy to insert and remove from a pants/shirt pocket. This wasn't the case with another, more rubbery, case that I had previously tried. Also, the two halves of the case can be difficult to detach from one another. This is obviously by design, and to me is a plus, but it can be a inconvenient if you're someone who often needs to use a spare battery (to separate the two halves, you'll need to insert a narrow, thin object into a slot on the side of the item and twist. The slot appears to exist for this purpose).Bottom Line: Great product but be sure to buy more than one.",5
Case tab was broken when it arrived.  It broke really easily and I finally just took it off of my phone.,2
"The case is great, it feels great because it's a soft touch plastic coating (not silicon or rubber).The down side is that the clip/connection that holds the two pieces together is not very strong. I remove the case and put it back on may be 5-6 times to clean my phone and two of the connecting pieces broke. (But if you rarely take your case off, then this is great for the price). Will have to look for another brand.",3
"The good:It fit well. it was cheap (paid $2 with shipping).The bad:corner clip broke within a week followed by the rest of the same corner. it just started to crumble. phone was never dropped or abused. case is very thin and flimsy. rubberized outer part is almost non-existent. i went back to my old, floppy, all rubber case and i'm much happier.",1
"After buying and returning a crappy $20 plastic case from my local Verizon store, (I should have known) I decided to give this one a try. I was very pleased when it arrived because it was exactly what I was looking for. The 'rubberized' feel of the product is perfect...it's not so rubbery that it's hard to slip in my pocket, but does provide adequate grip when holding my phone. The two pieces snap together well and there is no movement of the phone within the case, and it doesn't make any creaking noise like the one from Verizon did. All ports and buttons are fully accessible and exactly placed. The one problem I think I may have, which is not unique to this case, is it's a bit more difficult to use the slide down bar on the top of the screen. The best thing about this case is that it's cheap enough that if it breaks or gets damaged enough, I just buy another one.",4
"Looks good, and seems to offer a great level of protection without adding as much bulk as other cases. Attractive design, looks great on BestBuy's 'white' Facinate.Only minor gripe is that this doesn't fit quite as tightly as the one I bought for my Droid X - still a GREAT choice in a case, but even more so given the price!",5
"My wife bought a few different gel skin and silicone cases for her Samsung Fascinate.  This is the case she likes the best.  It fits the phone snugly and seems to offer a level of protection from scratches and falls.  It also looks pretty good with the checkerboard pattern.We were able to test the phones dropping protection value this morning when my wife accidentally dropped the phone in the toilet.  Yes, the toilet.  Luckily she acted quickly and grabbed the phone out of the water.  It was still water because the phone swimming incident happened BEFORE the toilet was used.  While that situation is not ideal, it is better than the alternative.The phone banged on the side of the toilet and then splashed in.  We immediately removed the gel skin cover and I took off the rear case and pulled the battery.  Then we dried it with paper towels and let it sit for the rest of the day.  I think the snugness of the case stopped a lot of the water from entering the phone.  It is probably not part of the design, but it worked to our advantage today.My wife put the battery back in the phone (which had been cleaned thoroughly) and it appears to be working perfectly.  Although she has been using text and email since turning it on.  You don't think she is afraid to hold the phone up against her face, do you?",5
"Bought this case for my wifes WHITE Fascinate after reading the amount of positive reviews it had.  She wanted a case that would protect AND show off her white phone and this case does both well.  Now, it's not going to give you the protection of say a thicker rubber case (ie. Otterbox), but it looks alot better and does give a small amount of protection.  I bought the 'smoke' colored one for my black fascinate b/c I liked hers so much.",5
"I love this cover so much, I purchased 2 more in different colors! This cover has saved my phone several times form being destroyed after dropping it!",5
"Ii bought this cover for my daughter's phone.  It fits perfectly and is not very easy to get off, which I like because it does not need to come off, I don't want the screen to crack.",5
"Pros -I can still see my phone skin through it.Buttons on the edges are protected.Covers just enough of the front edge that it goes over my screen protector.Cons - None!Note - The argyle pattern is not textured, but smooth across the case.Bottom Line - I would purchase again and would recommend to a friend.",5
My husband wanted this case for his samsung fascinate. We found it at the mall for $22. This is the exact same case for a fraction of the cost. Once on the phone it is very dark grey since the phone is black. It fits snuggly on the case and slides easily into his pocket. He is very pleased with the case. We will be ordering a few more in different colors.,5
I ordered this accessory to protect my phone and it does just that.  It covers the back and all around the edges while still leaving the speaker on the rear and camera open.Pros:Good protectionNice lookingFits snug on my phone unlike other reviewerNot a pain to get on or offNot bulky and doesn't stick to fabrics (in and out of pocket without hassle)Cons:Only con I have may be more of a fault of Samsung.  The USB port is thin and some Micro-USB cables don't 'click' in all the way with this phone.  The ones that do seem to bypass the cover no problem.  But I noticed some 3.5mm speaker cables don't fully insert and connect when I have the cover on.  My headphones do but some older cables may be too bulky around the edges and may not be able to fully plug in causing connectivity issues.,5
"I bought my wife the clear case like this/this brand and seen how nice/cool it made her phone look.  So I decided to by the smoke colored one for my black fascinate.  It fits great on the phone and looks even better (the pattern on the back looks cool too). It provides minimal protection, but just enough imo to handle a short drop.  It feels good in your hand/grips your hand back kinda thing.  I love it!",5
"This case for the Fascinate is wonderful. It is slim, and not cheaply made for how much it is. I reccomend this because the buttons are easy to press, and locate (you don't spend 5 minutes sliding your finger up and down looking for the buttons) and overall, good quality. Buy this if you haven't already.",5
I was very pleased with my skin cover. It was exactly what I needed. I fits the phone perfectly. It arrived on time. I would recommend this product.,5
"I liked this case, but sometimes it would pull off my battery plate when removing it. Protected my phone and I dropped it hundred of times!",5
"It's fine, but why bother. I ended up taking it off the phone because I liked the look and feel better without it and the phone has survived fine.",3
"The fit of the case/cover was much better than I'd experienced with other 'soft' cell phone covers. It fit much more snugly and securely than covers I'd purchased from a brick and mortar store for three times as much. It's already saved my phone once, when dropped. The pattern is very subtle. Much more subtle than I anticipated, but I found that I liked it more that way. Since it fits so snug/secure it also reduces the bulk it adds to the phone. One of the things I like best about the Samsung Fascinate is that it's a fairly slim/sleek phone. This case doesn't take too much away from that. I highly recommend the 'soft' cases with this phone. Especially after nearly ruining my phone when unable to remove a hard cover that was causing overheating issues. (Which lead to me purchasing a new battery door - thankfully - no damage to the screen.)",5
"The $20 price tag of many of the cases in the Verizon store led me to search elsewhere, especially since they seem so cheap and flimsy. I was pretty particular about the kind of case I wanted for my new Fascinate, and none of the in-store cases met my requirements either, so I decided to try a couple from Amazon. This gel skin case met all of my requirements and then some:-Slides easily in and out of my pocket - this eliminated most rubberized and silicone cases. This gel case is slick to the touch, but still provides more grip than the naked phone.-Minimal interference with the front face of the phone - another plastic case I tried from Amazon covered too much of the edge of the front face, making it difficult to move icons between screens and initiate Android's drop-down status bar.-Soft/flexible - with hard cases, when the phone vibrates and it's sitting on a hard surface (e.g. on my desk at work) the vibration is extremely loud. Soft cases absorb much of the sound.-Soft to the touch - another hard rubberized case I tried eventually started to feel rough, like very fine sandpaper. Completely distracts from from the overall appeal of the phone.-Case cannot make any noise - a plastic case I tried from the Verizon store 'creaked' whenever I would use the phone and as the plastic flexed. It wasn't loud, but enough of a sound to drive me crazy and cheapen the feel of the phone.So overall, this gel skin case met or exceeded all of my requirements and I have been very happy with it. To address some of the concerns of other reviewers, I actually like how the case completely covers the side volume and power buttons (as opposed to allowing them to be exposed). The buttons seem to fix snug inside the interior indention for those buttons, so it protects them well.Also, as some reviewers have noted, this case allows the 'natural beauty' of the Fascinate to show through, and is the best aspect of this case. Although I could have done without the argyle pattern on the back, the case is hardly noticeable when looking at the front face -- it barely comes up over the side, allowing for maximum exposure of the screen and soft keys.",5
Just like the OEM. Works fine. Charges and holds a charge just  like the original battery. Should have gotten an extra one.&#8203;,5
Got this battery in a timely manner.  It only lasts slightly longer than the origional one in my phone.  The contacts have wear marks on them and it was packed in a simple clear plastic bag.  All of these things lead me to believe that the battery was a recycled used battery.  At least it was cheap and now I have a spare battery.,3
"Very good price for a new battery and is the correct oem replacement for the droid x phone. I use this as my backup and it holds a charge as good as the original battery, will purchase another one when needed.",5
Works just as described.  I would not hesitate to order another one when the time comes.  Holds a good long charge.,5
So fard is all good... the battery is bean used every day and it does a good job... I had good luck whith this one... I bouth another battery for a Blackberry and they sent me a Used Battere... sing I live in Dominican Republic I well not sent it back... But... that is the risk we take when buying thins on Internet...This is a good deal if you need a Motorola droid x Battery,5
Bought this for a friend that was having problems with her phone. She changed out the battery and all is good now.,4
This is my second one - to replace the original. I buy extra batteries and  an outside charge. If I have a long day planned I just grab the extra battery and go.,4
"I broke out my trusty Droid X during a recent blackout to use as a flashlight in the basement and realized the battery that I'd had in there had puffed up so big to the point where the LCD display was being pressed up against the glass from behind. Needless to say I threw that one out, bought this one from CellularFactory (I mention the vendor because they might vary by seller), and now the phone lasts me a minimum of 3 full days with WiFi on. (It should be noted that the phone is not activated with Verizon, I now only use it as a gaming/media device while my main phone is charging)",5
Batterys workin good I ordered 3 of them good product period! (new batterys) got two phones quality of batterys great recommend this item to other partons to buy,4
"I bought two of these, as the original battery in my Droid X is starting to show its age. These batteries are true Motorola batteries, exactly the same type (BH-5X) as the one originally installed on my phone.Sometimes I see reviews from people who say they got used batteries when they thought they were getting new batteries - they say there were nicks or scratches on the batteries and they wouldn't hold a charge like a new battery would. However, I seem to have received two new batteries - no scratches or dings on them and they both operate as long between charges as new batteries should. The supplier when I ordered these was The OEM Shop, and the shipment was delivered on time directly from them. Keep in mind that suppliers for these types of items changes frequently.I am happy with my purchase, and recommend this battery.",5
"My phone is no longer made.  The batteries the phone carriers sell are WAY over priced. Everyone I know is hesitant to purchase batteries online, but I have done this for years, and if I only get minimal length of service, the cost of the battery is worth it.  I don't like to put out too much money.",5
I got this to replace my original battery. It worked well. Held a charge better then my original one did.,4
I ordered 2 of these batteries. So far so good. The battery seems to last as long as original battery when new. I have seen no reason to believe its not new. I am 100% happy with this product and recommend this battery. Great battery at a great price. :),5
Worked fine but would not hold charge but a few hours without use. Wasn't much better than my old one. Spent money bought a different one and it worked great. Held charge all day with use. Would not recommend,2
I got this item a month back and it works as expected. Works and looks just like the battery that came with my phone (must really be OEM). Works great as this battery fits in my wallet. Charges in phone just like my original battery.If any change in performance I'll update this review.,5
This battery was better than my previous one. It charged faster and lasted longer for the first few months. At first my phone didn't recognize it but then it did all of a sudden. It dies pretty quickly now.,2
This was a great purchase for me made it easy to keep my phone on with my job being so demanding,5
"I purchased this battery as a backup.  It actually does not hold a charge better than the one I got with the phone, but it's nice to have a backup",3
Not only do these last a few hours the label looks to be fake. If you put this battery next to your original you will see that it is a good counterfeit but not the real deal. The hologram is faded and it is missing the white sticker with red x's on the side. Did I mention the battery only lasts a few hours? Don't buy from this seller!,1
I just want to say thank you so much ..I needed that battery real bad..thank you ..and will buy again .,3
These were great for the phone and did their job without messing up the phone or it's contents within.  I would recommend this product.,5
"These chargers are great. I have the wall charger at home, gave the car charger to my mother, and I keep the USB cable at work to charge through my computer. These are great!!!!",5
"this is such a nice combination of things I would have purchased individually had it not been available to me as a package deal. Products work exactly as described, no issues, arrived before promised",5
"I bought this for the car, to charge and be ready on my daily commutes to work. It is so nice to know I am covered.",4
"Products arrived in a timely manner, and was packaged great.  One for computer use, one for wall use, one with computer support.  Best purchase ever made on Amazon.cm",5
"This phone was provided to me by work, so I didn't complain much at first since they were paying for it. It took me 6 months before I couldn't stand it any more.- I would avoid this phone if you are thinking of buying it. -The 'click' screen is gimmicky, and tremendously painful to use when it's acting up.When it's working right I can see why it was a design decision - it is an interesting concept, but I can not understand how this product possibly made it through engineering and testing.Issues that you will experience when you own this phone:1) The screen will double and triple click on you2) The screen will fail to register where your finger is touching. Touching the bottom right of the screen will highlight the buttons in the top left3) One or more of the electric click sensors in your screen (one at each corner) will stick down. Failing to register any clicks in that quadrant no matter how hard you press. If all 4 corners go at once, the screen is unusable, and you need to pull your battery.4) Your click sensors will strangely start clicking themselves when your finger is nowhere near it. I had a condition happen multiple times where the phone, laying on my desk would click and unclick rapidly, like it was vibrating. This continued for a half-hour before it ran out my battery.Before anyone comments that 'your phone was defective' - I brought it into a Verizon store, and they told me that it was normal behavior for this phone, and RIM recommended that a battery pull be performed every other day to reboot the phone, and clear up issues like this. Hardly a consumer-ready product.",1
"es un excelente equipo. trabaja perfecto para movistar Venezuela, la calidad de las imagenes es muy buena. ninguna queja con el equipo, ademas solo se conseguiran refurbished porque el equipo no salio mas",4
The greatest thing about this phone is the suretype.It is sad that blackberry has done away with probably best ever typing feature called suretypeople.Can never go wrong.the words come upvlike magic.The call quality is good and the email set up awesome.It is impossible to beat blackberry as a communication phone.Great stuff.,5
Wow i remember when I first purchase this phone I was in love its a great phone but I guess now we have better phones around. I still love it,5
"Pros: Looks cool. Verizon version is unlockable so you can take it international or switch to T-Mobile or AT&T; (but they stink, so forget that). SurePress screen is perfect for someone such as myself who has had a hard time adapting to touch-screen technology. 3G signal is typically outstanding in NYC area where I live. Phone is reliable. I have dropped it (in an Otterbox case) dozens of time and it has yet to have any damage.Cons: Old and no 4G. Out of date OS software. SurePress screen slowly grows stiff. Not a lot of aps. No longer manufactured.Other Thoughts: My Storm2 is now 28 months old. It has taken a beating and keep on ticking. The SurePress screen has slowly grown a bit stiffer, but I just play with the adjustments to get it back to the way i want. Sometimes a hard reboot also helps. I have Verizon and did switch to T-Mobile when my contract ended, but they only give you EDGE on this phone so the slow speed and T-Mobile's lack of coverage just pushed me tight back to Verizon. I don't play games on my phone and the only web based stuff I do is checking my auctions if I am bored while waiting for the subway, so I see no reason to upgrade. WiFi and Bluetooth work a-okay here. Storm2 connects with ease to my TomTom.",4
"Every thing was sent to me except the 16 GB Micro SD card. Other than that, the phone came unlocked and ready to be use.  I will update if I have any problems and for now I would buy from this seller again.Update Feb. 7, 2012I have had no problems with the phone or updates.  Happy with purchase.",4
"I have the need for two cell phones, one for business, the other for personal use.  As a result, I can compare the Blackberry Storm 2 from Verizon and the Blackberry Bold 9700 from T-Mobile.  Similar phones in many respects with shared capabilities in the main but one is far more user friendly than the other in my opionion.  The Bold is the friendlier one by far.  As an aside, I am impressed by the level of service and follow-up by Verizon and the Storm 2 over T-Mobile but that's another issue for another time.The Storm 2 is quirky.  Maybe the same can be said of all touch screen devices but it tends to lock up, accept the wrong commands and is tough to navigate with those smallish querty keyboard symbols.  And you have to toggle between screens to add numerical data and certain punctuation marks to your text.  The Bold, in comparison, is not like typing on a regular keyboard either but it does allow for easy fixing of typos and with its chicklet fixed keyboard makes navigating a far easier task.And that's the main difference between the Bold and Storm 2:  Ease of navigation.  It's sort of like going from the original version of Windows (Storm 2) to Windows 7 (Bold 9700) if you follow my drift? The Storm 2 does have an advantage in the user being able to go from portrait to landscape mode which helps a little on typing text but even then, the keyboard is not forgiving.  The Storm 2 now has four sensor modules under the screen to help on the commands which is a step up over the ONE from the original Storm but stability is hardly the order of the day.Sending a text requires an additional menu call-up on the Storm 2 as opposed to the Bold. Also, on the Storm 2, one has to dig into the media icon to access the video camera.  Not so on the Bold.  More examples outlining the differences between the two phones.  In summation, I like both phones but the Bold would be my choice if I could only have one phone.  I think the Storm 2 has another generational change ahead of it before it can lay claim to being a true iphone alternative.You have to think the people at RIM and Blackberry are acutely aware of the Storm 2's issues because the phone is just short of being an all around excellent choice.  Right now the Storm 2 is a GOOD choice and I'll leave it there.UPDATE:  After many dropped calls in spite of good wi-fi or antenna 3G strength indicated, and having the Storm lock up on me after taking it from the charger, I couldn't continue and got out of it and the contract.  I'm beginning to think the folks at Blackberry and RIM have been not only passed but left in the dust by the competition.  To be fair, the Bold 9700 has been and still is a solid unit which I have no desire to replace.  The Storm2 is Blackberry's Edsel Ford given my short, costly and sad experience with it.",2
This fits into my 3 year old original droid incredible. I can't see myself replacing this phone since it is not as passe as the new android phones so I just bought this to replacde the broken tabs of the original cover.,5
"What can you say. This is the real deal. Exact and perfect replacement for cracked, damaged, scratched or otherwise ruined back cover of the original Droid Incredible from HTC. This one is for the original slim battery and will not fit with the extended battery.  My only issue with this and the original back was that the silver 'H T C' letters eventually peeled off the back, but who needs them anyway. Looks great without the silver letters.",5
I have ordered this item twice in the last year as my old D'inc is my music player/streamer while doing things around the house. I am always swapping out batteries and dropping this all the time. Both have been as good as the the original back that the phone came with. No issues. Thanks for helping me keep this thing going and looking like new.,5
"My son was given a droid phone with the extended battery, so it had the larger back cover which never really stayed on tight and kept breaking around the edges. The phone worked well, but the case was basically taped together on all sides. It was either buy a new phone, or find replacement parts. I decided to look around and I was able to find a couple of the slimmer batteries for him and this back cover. All of the parts fit great and it was like having a brand new phone! Now he can actually buy cases that fit his phone.",5
"Okay the Incredible is an old Android at this point.  I keep it for app development.  And I pull the cover a lot.  A medium guitar pick works best for that, btw.  The cover  arrived and was a perfect fit.  It does it's job well.  Thanks!",5
I bought this along with many other parts when I was rebuilding a Droid Incredible. This back fit perfectly and looked great on the overhauled phone! I would highly recommend it!!,5
After a day in the sun this case stopped fitting together. The bottom part became too big to fit into the top.,3
"Bought it for a gift for my husband, he loves it. Keeps his phone protected and is not bulky...easy to use",5
"CaseCrown iPhone 4 and 4S Glider Slim Fit Case - Black Obsidian (Fits AT&T;, Sprint and Verizon iPhone 4 and 4S)Fit perfectly, snug and not too sticky. Perfect cut outs for the camera/flash, speakers, and ear piece. Only issue is plugging in headphone/RCA jack. If playing music and need a plug in, the case must be removed to get a proper connection. Good case, color, and material quality. Recommended.",4
"Great little case!  I had this case on my iPhone 4S for about a year.  Dropped many, many times, and the phone still worked great, no cracks, no breaks.  There is a soft felt inside to this case which adds to the protection.  Definitely worth the money.",5
Had it for several months now and it still looks good.  I've owned several different cases all of which never last all that long or begin to fade.  I know some people had experiences with the finish rubbing off on this but I haven't had that issue.  It's a nice classic black case that feels good in the hand.  I'd get another one.,5
I bought this foe my husband he was complaining that the otter box was too bulky and I said okay will look for another slim case and this has met his needs its slim and durable he has dropped the phone multiple times and nothing has happened it's great,5
I can't imagine a better case for my needs. I just purchased my 2nd one. The first CaseCrown case lasted for 3 years. It recently cracked after a fall. My iPhone 4 suffered zero damage. I will buy again for my next phone.,5
I gave this case to my uncle as a gift and he really liked it. It doesn't feel cheap like other cases.I will recommend this to family and friends,5
"I like it.  It looks good on the phone and gives me that extra &#34;grip&#34;, but I don't know how well it would withstand a drop.  Plus the headphone area is blocked so you can only use &#34;slim&#34; wires.",3
"I like the texture of the case, however I wanted something that allowed access to the headphone and charging jack easily, but most of the time i have to take the case off to hook it up.  Also, there is no lip on the front edge which means if i drop it flat on the front there won't be much protection.  I have dropped it a couple times from waste high and it protected it so far.",2
"I love it! It's very tight and won't just fall off your phone. Feels really nice in my hand, and I would totally recommend it to my friends!",5
"I love these cases, its a super tight fit to your phone and it covers all of the bases. I am definitely buying more.",5
"I love the way this case feels in my hand. It lasted a year or so, was thin enough, but still managed to protect my phone. I've had a difficult time finding one that I like equally.",5
"I wanted to protect my phone with a simple yet stylish case. Nothing flashy, nothing bulky. This was it for me. The only downfall for me was that I sometimes would mess with the case and slide it open and closed and eventually it became loose and didnt fit properly. I highly recommend this case to those who have a hard time digging their bulky phone cases out of their pocket.",4
nice sleek black look.lip size around screen will help from damage to it. Its very easy to remove and and put in phone into case.,4
"Slid on my Sprint Iphone 4S with a little force.Good investment for abrasion resistance. Protects the back and sides from surface abrasion while in my pocket or on my desk.Texture feels good in the palm. Happy Customer, will buy another case in the future.",4
"The case by far is the best and improved over the 3GS case with a felt lining to prevent dust and dirt from lodging in between the case and the back of the iPhone.The only downside is when using the camer with flash - you will notice a picture which is far less vibrant than pictures taken without the case. For the best pics in low light - remove the case. I became curious when my finger was interfering with the flash - it didn't seem close, but it was close enough, so I wonder if the case interfered as well - big difference and any case would have the same problem.Other issue is access to all the iPhones buttons. Unless you have small fingers, then you won't have much access.Still the best feel and protection based on my needs. There are trade offs, but nothing I can't work around. Once you learn how to remove the case, you'll be able to remove it on time for great pics. Keep in mind, apple never intended there to be a case because the phone is so beautifully designed and difficult to damage.Sorry for any typos, I am not about to proof read and make changes while typing this on my phone.I'll try and upload photos from my puter soon so that the photo differences can be reviewed.",4
"The case is sturdy, sleek, minimal.  Everything I look for in a case.  The edges are slightly raised so the screen isnt in direct contact with the surface if my phone is placed on its faces which is probably the only way I would have gotten scratches on it but not so much as to make it look cheap or alien to the iphone hardware (which is why i personally dont like otterboxes and lifeproof cases) but rather compliments the iphone design.  Case looks and feels more expensive than it is and offers alot more protection to the rest of my iphone than some other &#34;minimal&#34; cases that I've had.",5
"This case fits very well and the two part construction gives an easy way to slide the phone into the cover with the top just sliding on as well. the black rubber construction is really great in that it does not show dirt that a light colored cover can . this is important for a day to day usage. the cutouts for the speaker, camera , reset, and the volume are well placed and allow easy acces to the exterior buttons. A design could have been somewhat better if the front had a front cover as well. just sayin.",5
This case was extremly cheap and well made. Fits my iphone the way i want it too without creating the extra bulk.,5
This Case works very well to help protect your iPhone from damage . The case it built very sturdy and can be put through hell. I Honestly Recommend This Case For iPhone Protection.,5
"This is a SOLID case. If you want the case to almost be nonexistent but still serve a slight purpose, this is the case for you.I ended up going with something that gave a little more protection, but as far as slim cases go, this is the one. My only reason for switching was because of the lack of lip that gives separation between the front glass and a table that you might set it facedown on. But my girlfriend just wanted a slim case like this and she freaking LOVES this one. Highly recommended.",4
"Very stylish case. Whether you can tell or not, this low profile case with protect your phone for days, weeks and months to come without taking away from your phones sleekness.",5
I had an Otter Box Defender. In comparison this case is not as rugged but it brings back so much of the beauty that is lost using a bulky case.,4
Amazing case works well fits the iphone 4s perfectly. can't complain at all! Would recommend to everyone. protects phone amazingly and not one scratch on my case.,5
Fits great and feels great in your hands.  Sturdy enough to withstand some short drops.  I  would recommend this case as it is a great value and does the job.,5
"Fits perfectly (over white 4s), looks and feels great, and protects!  I dropped my phone onto an asphalt surface yesterday, and nothing happened to it.  Screen protector is also a must. The splash Masque Clear Screen Protector is outstanding.",5
"I have gone through a few cases for my iPhone 4s, and this is without question the best I have found.  It is very low profile but still provides great protection.  There is a very low bezel around the front that provides the screen some protection when face down on a table, but does not get in the way of operating the phone.  I highly recommend this case!",5
I have had a lot of iphone cases and the slider cases are my favorite. It has been droped many times and protects the phone very well. IT is a rubberized texture which makes the phone easier to hold.,5
"I like the look, it fits well and looks good.  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.",5
I love this case. It is perfect for people that dock their iPhone because the bottom piece comes off without having to remove the entire case.,5
"I took a chance on this case and when it arrived, I was extremely happy. CaseCrown is my favorite vendor for cases now. Thanks to Amazon for helping me discover them. Now I just buy directly from them. Life's good.",5
"I've been using this case for 6 months, and in that time I've dropped my phone more times than I can count, and there's not a scratch on it. Even the case has held up amazingly well--the matte surface doesn't scratch easily. I love how slim and unobtrusive it is--I'm not a big fan of the bulky colorful ones. It's also very easy to get the phone in and out of it (I routinely take it out to use an armband-case when I'm jogging). I have nothing negative to say about this case!",5
"These cases are smooth in texture, attractive in color, and, most importantly, very protective. I had one of these cases on my phone while I was visiting a museum (with stone tile floors). I somehow missed my pocket and the phone fell on the floor from waist high. The case itself was nicked, but the phone was fine. I love this case.Right now, my &#34;case&#34; is a combination of the blue case in the same series (which is much darker than is pictured on the site--closer to a beautiful indigo color) and this black one. Blue at the top, black at the bottom. People have complimented me on it, saying &#34;I like your new case!&#34; I like other combinations as well.I wish CaseCrown would make this series in more colors! (I would probably buy them all!)",5
"This case has a really narrow fit on the iPhone 4S black; for me it is impossible to install on an iPhone 4S white. I attempted to install it on the 4S white, but after sliding the iphone about 2/3 in, I realized I could not get the case installed without doing some damage to it.Others have commented that the cases are impossible to take out after installation. Well, indeed, even with only 2/3 of the iPhone in the case it took a lot of force to pull the case out - and it did leave some nasty scuff marks on the sides of the iPhone. I am not a fan of cases that can never ever be taken out or which damage the device they're supposed to protect when removed.Also, from the photos, it does look like the case provides a very small lip to protect the front glass screen when the device is set face down. Well, that edge is raised above the glass plane barely 0.5mm, barely there, barely functional. Returning mine - I like the snug fit cases, but there should be a way to make the fit without damaging the iPhone in the process of installation. Once this is installed, it never comes out - I'm not yet ready to commit that this will be the only case I'll ever use on this iPhone...",1
"A naked iPhone 4 has too much exposed fragile glass, thus prone to scratches and breakage.  I also find the sharp edges uncomfortable on my hands when compared to the rounded edges of the previous iPhones.My ideal case is one that does not add bulk, protects all iPhone surfaces, is comfortable in my hand, allows for access to all bulky chargers and docks, and fits loosely inside my belt case.  After physically comparing 7 other cases and 3 bumpers, and researching tens of other cases, I have not yet found my ideal case, but I returned this case and kept theSonix Snap Slim Case for iPhone 4 with 2 Screen Protectors (Black).This case adds some bulk to the iPhone 4 (medium).  It protects the back and the camera lens (good).  When laid upside down on a flat surface, the front of the phone will not touch the surface (good) (see picture above), but theSonix Snap Slim Case for iPhone 4 with 2 Screen Protectors (Black)is raised more.  It is more comfortable to hold than a naked iPhone 4 (good).  My belt case can accommodate the iPhone 4 inside of this case, but it is a tight fit (medium).  However, I deducted 2 stars since my bulky chargers and docks cannot connect to the 30 pin connector without needing to remove the lower part of the case (medium), which is a problem with many other cases and the Apple Bumper, but not a problem with several other cases. I returned this case and kept theSonix Snap Slim Case for iPhone 4 with 2 Screen Protectors (Black).",3
"this product is strictly for show, does not offer any protection from drop or falls, easy to slide phone in and there are very cute, but this will NOT protect your Iphone!!!",2
Very low profile .. Probably not as protective as some of the bulkier ones but does the job. I like it,5
Good fitting.  Sturdy.  Another CaseCrown winner.  I recommend this case.  I love it; my IPHONE loves it.  Price was excellent too.,5
"I was in the market for a decent slider case and after reading literally hundreds of reviews on a multitude of cases, I selected this one and I'm glad I did. I was looking for a case that was easy to put on and remove, but wasn't so loose as to have the bottom section slipping down and falling off, nor so tight as to scratch the sides of the phone. I also wanted some protection without much bulk as in the warmer weather I like to slip my phone into my shirt or pants pocket.This case meets all those requirements handily. I'm particularly pleased with the texture of the back. It's a bit hard for me to describe it, but it feels like a velvety rubber material. It provides just enough friction to ensure a good grip and yet smooth enough not to attract lint or drag when taking it out of your pocket. All ports are exposed and the camera opening seems adequate for my iPhone 4s. I can't comment on any possible flash issues as I haven't taken any night photos as of yet.The icing on the cake is that this case is very inexpensive and provides features that I couldn't find on cases costing much more.Highly recommended.",5
"I chose this case for my new iPhone 4 because of the satisfaction I received with a similar CaseCrown product used with an iPhone 3GS for two years. I'm not disappointed in any way. This product has a silky, grippy feel, looks great, is thin and unobtrusive and does what I want it to do...provide reasonable protection from scratches and minor bumps without feeling like a suitcase.",5
"I work in the technology industry, I love gadgets and good tech and am constantly (to the chagrin of my wife at times) buying and trying all sorts of devices and their associated accessories.To me, finding the 'perfect' (to me) phone case is much akin to my eternal quest to find the best pizza or chicken wings, sometimes you find a good one, but deep down you just 'know' it could be better in some way you can't put your finger on.Well my quest was ended when I bought my first CaseCrown Glider case for my iPhone 4 at the time (now on my 4s).It's just so simple but the fit and finish is excellent. I've never had another case that fit so perfectly and was so unobtrusive as these cases.I originally had a grey/sliver colored model that was somewhat shinny. I tend to put my phone in the shirt pocket of my dress shirts when I'm driving and on a handful of occasions, I had a lapse in judgement getting out of my car and leaned over a bit to much and sent my iPhone hurdling out of my shirt pocket straight onto my concrete garage floor.The CaseCrown took the brunt of the blow like a champ, leaving my iPhone 100% unscathed every single time. The same could not be said for the case, though the damage was surprisingly minor but added up after a number of drops like this.I just recently replaced my grey/silver CaseCrown Glider with this one for two reasons. After so many brutal drops and good hits on the corners of my old case, I feared another harsh hit like the ones prior would be to much for my faithful CaseCrown case to withstand and in the end didn't want to risk my insanely expensive to replace phone when a new case can be had for $10. Additionally, this model (Black Obsidian) has a somewhat soft to the touch rubberized texture to it that provides a lot more grip than the gray/sliver with a sheen to it case was able to.As I'm a creature of habit, I've caught myself leaning over well further than I should with my phone in this new case in my shirt pocket and have a moment of panic that I'm about to rocket my phone into the floor again but then I realize, it's staying put due to the rubberized texture of this case.Next up is the 'Chameleon' CaseCrown Glider to replace the one on my wife's iPhone as her's has about exceed it's martyrdom.",5
"I purchased the case back in October for my new AT&T iPhone 4s.  Recently after taking some outdoor flash pictures after dark I noticed a halo effect in all the pictures which I could not explain.  After taking the case off the camera, the halo effect was not seen.  It appears the opening around the flash unit on the back of the camera is not large enough and is the cause of the halo effect seen in all the pictures taken with the case on.  Other than this the case is fine and does a good job.",3
"Overall, I I guess I'm satisfied with this case. It fits like a glove on my iPhone 4s, no creaking or anything and is very sturdy. The case is composed of a top piece and a bottom piece that slide together. That being said, each individual piece consists of two pieces of hard plastic meshed together. The top piece is a little more than 3/4 of the length of the phone itself, and I can see where the two pieces of plastic were put together to create the piece. However, at the top, to the left of the power button, there's a bulge where the plastic wasn't put together properly, resulting in a small, but noticeable lip that can be caught by a fingernail.The case is perfect aside from that, but this leads me to believe that all of these cases aren't created equally. I'd send it back, but I don't want to be without protection on my new 4s for another week as I already have minor scratches on it (I paid for overnight shipping for it to arrive on Saturday, but did not receive it until today, Tuesday morning).All in all, I'm happy to have  good case for my new phone, but I'm not happy that it's not perfect. If something happens to this case, I'll probably be looking at another brand as a replacement as I don't feel like worrying about whether or not my case will be properly molded together.All in all, 3/5.Pros:- fits great- slides easily into my pocket, whether I'm wearing sweatpants, jeans, khakis, etc.- adds almost no bulk to the phone, maintaining comfortable one-handed usability- leaves room for screen protector on the front without interferenceCons:- molding not perfect; causing it not to look as uniform as I'd like- would like it to be a bit more raised in the front to further protect the screen from a drop",3
Very happy with these cases on our IPhone 4S's. These are easy to put on and they have stayed on like a champ. I wanted something that would give a more secure feel to holding the phone while not getting in the way or adding too much bulk.This is it!,5
I love it! It does everything I want it to do and it's small and fits anywhere in your car....good buy!,5
"I purchased one of these for my SUV for a long cross country trip. Worked great. At one point we had all the slots used (GPS, 2 phones, and a laptop) and it worked perfectly. Cord is a bit long but give the capability to mount it if you wanted to. I liked it so much I purchased a second one for my wifes car.",5
Haven't had this product long but so far so good.  I like the dual plug in style on the charger that includes USB access.  The only thing I don't care for is how you have to find somewhere to rest the unit on because the plug in has a cord attached to it which prevents it from being stabilized.  Other than that I really like it!,4
it is very good I have no problems with it it is small so it fits in good places and I do like the dual USB cord or you can have the two plugins but is very good I would recommend it,5
"Bought as a gift and so far it works well!  Haven't tried connecting all four inputs at once and hoping that won't cause a short or anything.  Right now, only connected 3 of 4.",5
This adapter works great. The higher amp USB port charges our IPOD Touch with NO problems. Very happy with this adapter.,5
I like this car charger. I use the 2.1a USB charger for Samsung s3. It charges the phone pretty good.  The charger has blue lights in the sockets so you know it has power to it.,5
"I was a little worried that it would be one of those really cheap 'Chinese' items that would break after a week. I was positively surprised how well it's made. The slightly angled 12 Volt plugs make perfect sense as they leave enough space to reach the USB cables which you probably use more often. The cable isn't too long. I find it an advantage as I keep the unit close to my original cigarette lighter plug and I don't have to deal with a long cable. Don't make the mistake to overload it. The total power you can get is still 150 Watt. It's not a limitation of this product it's just the limit of cigarette lighter plugs in general.The product is flat on the top and bottom which makes it great to attach velcro or double sides tape if you want to mount it semi permanent in your car. Overall, super happy with my decision.",5
"I've bought a TON of adapters over the years, but these are hands down the best in-car usb charger you can find. Well built. I purchased mine from this same vendor, but on eBay. Shipping was fast and they were well packaged. This charges my HTC Vision (T-Mobile G2) in under an hour, that's with bluetooth running and streaming audio via 4G OTA while driving down the road!!! I cut the cigarette adapter off of one of them and hard-wired it to my car's wiring, so I could have an 'always on' usb charger. This thing even powers my external hard drive that I hook up to my stereo's USB port (it's one of the older externals that requires a second usb port dedicated to powering the drive) so that's nice to be able to power that and charge my phone, GPS unit...etc... all at the same time. Anyone wondering, yes this will charge your Nook Color, iPad, iPhone4...etc... because both ports are 2A, not 2A split between the two like most other usb car adapters you will find.HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT, DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT's SUPPOSED TO DO!!! (for a GREAT price!)",5
"I've got two of these (one for my car, one for wife's.)Great for trips keeping everything charged... and I keep iphone and microusb plugged into each usb port for charging whenever in car.",4
"Both the 12V and USB outputs appear to work as advertised. Charges my HTC Evo 3D at about the same rate as my other charger. Was able to power the GPS while charging my phone.Edit: December 2013. After a 2,000 mile road trip, we discovered that the 1A outlet would not keep my Android phone charged. We needed to use the 2.1A USB port to keep my phone battery from dying. Also, one of the springs on the side of the CLA plug got stuck, allowing the plug to slide out of the socket randomly, resulting in loss of power to the GPS and phone.",3
"Works 100% as a splitter but the USB ports don't seem to be putting out as much power as I'd have thought based on the quoted amperages. It's possible that it's not correctly charging in &#34;AC mode&#34; for my Android phone, but I shouldn't have to solder anything in a charger to get that effect.",4
This works very well.  I use it in a small airplane and it allows me to plug in my GPS and also charge my iPad mini or iPhone.,5
It took awhile for me to get the product. When the product arrived I was VERY pleased! It was exactly what I wanted for long car rides that I need to charge phones and the GPS!,5
"Use this to power a car cam, fm transmitter, tablet and cell charger and haven't had any issues.  Seems to charge as well as the last one I had yet is more compact.  I would recommend this product.",4
"It serves its function, but it's a bit much on the wiring and some chargers don't seem to fit too well.",3
I put this in my car a few weeks ago and it's been a great addition. Now I can plug in my GPS and charge my cell and bluetooth at the same time. The extra voltage is also a great advantage.,5
"We own two cars, and we use this in each of them: it's reliable and allows us to charge tablet, phone, keep the GPS plugged it and if needed also have a a dvd player going. works flawlessly. Just wish it'd was a little more &#34;square&#34; so it would fit better in the space next to our cigarette lighter plug. other than this minor &#34;flaw&#34; we're very happy.",5
I have made this my &#34;power center&#34; for my car. I used velcro to stick this to the underside of my dash and make it always available.  It is solidly constructed and has given no trouble at all in many months of constant use.,5
"This is a well made unit, had my electric cooler pluged in today with 2 cell phones, it worked great",5
"As other reviewers have mentioned it can lose contact at times. The extra USB ports are a great advantage since my car immediately goes into AUX mode when I try charging my phone with a USB cable. Look for other similarly priced chargers (make sure they are fused like this one to avoid a burn out of your phone). This doesn't look that great either, has a cheap flimsy feel to it.",3
"I choose only 4 stars because i didnt try the USB port, since my mobile phone and devices only uses the 12V socket..those sockets works well, and nothing wrong with them================================Jan 2014: still works great, no issues. excellent product",5
"Very nice product for the price. I was looking to replace my older car charger with USB ports as it was not charging my Atrix 4G. Upon some research I found out that it required higher amperage to charge.The Bestek cigarette lighter (from laszpower) answered that need. Now I can charge my Atrix phone and other devices. The blue light is very pleasant for night drives. The cord is thick, adequate length and looks durable (that made me think of something else ha ha).No complaints with the vendor, did not need to contact them since shipping, packaging and the product were satisfactory.",5
With two lighter style ports and two USB ports you can't go wrong with this charger. Well made and a great price.  I ended up buying two.,5
"Be careful, any socket on car has 10A or 20A limitation or 120W or 240W limitation. Though I may plug in a 300W alternator, I can't get the full power out of it.The fact of provided with two USB charger is the main reason I bought this item.",5
"Excellent product, durable construction - 2 x 12V ports and 2 x USB charger ports. Nice blue light when powered and 12V jack makes good contact with car charger port. Works flawlessly.",5
One of the two USB ports died after 3 months. Was working great until then.I don't see any warranty with the product.,2
"We are looking forward to using this on our trip to Florida next month, so we can charge our phone and our ebooks at the same time if needed...it arrived long before scheduled and we were surprised to receive it so soon as the estimated arrival was in August...thanx for the good service...and prompt delivery. I am sure we will get a lot of use out of this product.",5
"Nice to be able to plug in 4 things at once in the car. A few things: sometimes the car plugs work themselves out a bit, so you have to make sure they're pushed in all the way and stuff is actually charging; and my phone has told me that, when charging through this splitter, it's not charging as fast as it should be, and I should use a proper charger to charge it normally.",3
"It does work, providing two accessory outlets and two USB ports, one of which is high current.  However, the accessory outlets seem like they're a larger size than the cigarette lighter outlet in my car.  This is fine for most devices, which have some sort of spring to keep them secure in the outlet, but fails to securely hold some other devices (such as the cigarette lighter rechargeable flashlight I have).  It also doesn't come with any plugs for the accessory outlet, so they're always sitting there open - it would have been better to have a cap that you could plug in an unused outlet.",3
Nice little unit with dual plugins and dual USB outlets and it you have kids in the back seat needing power go buy Amazon's 9 ft extension. I also got headphones for everyone and now I can drive without a sound from my kids !!I would buy it again !!,5
"This is, hands-down, the best car charger I have owned. I use this on trips to power the kids' DVD players, my phone, and my wife's iPod touch. The A/C ports are nice and deep, so you don't have to worry about stuff coming unplugged, which was a problem with other adapters I've owned in the past.",5
"Something that should be standard issue in all cars, extra ports, long cable for easy positioning, and two USB charging ports, importantly the 2A slot for tablets and big smart phones.",5
"Comes in very handy to not have another cheap USB adapter piece that can break. I can have my iPhone, my GPS, and my radar detector all hooked up with no hassle. It has a pretty long cord, but I leave it tied up. Haven't tested with my iPad yet, but I would say don't power other devices when charging an iPad. I really like this little gadget.",5
With so many usb chargers being included with portable devices this is the ideal splitter for family road trips.  Saved me from having to buy 2 separate car chargers.,5
"excellent product and quality, not too bulky, keeped my phone safe ,unfortunately i do have the phone anymore, but this case was a hero protecting my phone,i really recommend to any one",5
"Great product, fits snugly like it should.  This is the second one I have bought as I wore the first one out.  Ive dropped the phone many times and no damage!!!  The rubber coating keeps the phone in place in your pocket!!",5
"The only issue that I have is that one of the internal tabs broke off when I was opening it up.  Though, with that little tab broken, at least it's easier open back up to get to the battery.It works well, and the clip actually fits my large belt.Plus: The case isn't huge like others and doesn't take 10 minutes and 23 layers to take off to get to the battery (sarcasm there).  Feels like it'll still protect the phone from drops.Minus: because of the method of belt clipping, the screen points to the outside world.  If I hit a corner on a desk, the screen could get damaged.  Also because of this, if you don't lock your screen the world can see it.  Oh well.For $12, a great value.  Since I'm going to be upgrading my phone in a few months, I went less expensive and am over all pleased with the case.",4
"This is the 3nd cover I have purchase from Body Glove, for family phones.  Superior phone covers.  Thanks for putting out such a great product.",5
"The salesman at Verizon recommended this, so I bought one from Amazon.  Having wasted money on cell phone cases/holsters in the past, I am slow to waste more.  This item is just what I wanted. There is a slip-on, rubberized case that covers all but the screen and the buttons. Then there is rubberized the holster that clips onto a belt.  The Droid slips securely into the holster for even more proection.It's nice when they get a product right.",5
"it fits perfectly, does exactly what it is supposed to do. keeps the phone safe from an accidental drop. can't ask for more than that.",4
"Overall the case is of great quality and fit. The built in stand is unique.  However, trying to attach or remove it from your belt is very difficult. After trying out an OtterBox, I plan to order one today on Amazon. I will keep this one to use without the clip.",3
"I really liked this case.  Comes with an optional removable clip/stand which is nice.  I didn't think it was too bulky and I'm glad I bought this case.  Feels like quality.  I bought the extended battery from verizon and it comes with a slightly taller back plate, well....this case fits perfectly fine with the verizon extended battery cover on.",5
"I'll preface this review with the disclaimer I have only used this product for 1 week, and have managed not to drop the phone yet.  The cover is a 2 piece design that snaps together. It is a hard plastic shell with a 'soft touch' coating. Fits perfectly, though finish could be a little better. Some Droid X users have said that the phone feels unsubstantial in the hand, this remedies that perceived problem. The soft touch coating also acts as a non-slip surface.  I expect this cover will protect the phone if I ever drop it, but I'd rather not have to test it.  Great value. Purchased this from Amazon and received it very quickly with the free shipping offer.",4
"It takes a bit to figure out how it snaps together and comes apart, but once that is done, it's as easy as pie.  FWIW do NOT BUY from the The OEM shop from NY, they are scammers and liars, the make false promises and do not respond to emails.  In fact I've had to file an A-Z claim against them.  That being said, the case is awesome, really, you can't do better for a Droid-X",5
Case fit super all good fittins droid x in ad out no problem greaaasaassst buy it u wont go wrong just right enjoy it,5
"The protective case fits very well.  It is snug and well designed.  It makes the phone easier to grip and protects part of the phone from bumps and small drops.  As a protective case this is a great product.  Obviously this item offers no production for the screen itself, which is probably the most vulnerable piece of the phone.One annoying feature is that the nub the belt clip snaps onto.  It is large and prevents you from laying the phone flat.  If you did not need the belt clip you could probably remove this nub.  However, if you need the belt clip, this piece has to remain and it's quite annoying.The belt clip can be used as a kickstand to prop the phone, which is a nice feature.I bought this case mainly so I could wear it on my belt at work. The belt clip is poorly designed.  It will not hold firmly onto even a simple, thin leather dress belt.  The arm won't close onto it.  There is a protrusion that is part of the kickstand hinge that protrudes into the part where the belt goes, prevent it from closing completely over a standard belt.  A simple bump will knock this off your belt and onto the floor.  It does work on thin soft material, like a fanny pack strap, but not a belt. It's almost like no one even bothered to test it on an actual belt during the design phase.I typically have been very satisfied with Body Glove cases that I have bought, and I have owned several over the years.  This is the exception.  As a case only this works very well.  If you want to clip this onto something like a belt, I'd look for something else.Summary:  Nice case, crappy belt clip",3
"Like others, I have used many different brands of cell phone cases/covers. Regardless of price I invariably return to the Body Glove products for several reasons:1. They always have fit the model they claim to fit.2. Unlike other pre-molded products, Body Glove requires no break-in period. Fits properly right out of the box.3. Price point for other competitive items is always in between over-priced, unrealistically hyped products and cheap items that are made to fit a general size and not the actual product.4. Long lasting. I have never worn out a Body Glove case. I have broken more than one at its connection points but only when I exceed the recommended uses (usually extended batteries).5. For my tastes, the feel/grip of their cases feel solid and secure without adding excess bulk.This is my second Body Glove for the Droid X. I am somewhat OCD about dust and lint and my electronics so I tend to take my phone from the case often for a lint free cloth wipe down.On the Droid X model, it doesn't state it is compatible with the Motorola extended battery and cover plate but I bought my Droid X soon after release and it took this long for repeated snaps on and off to finally break a single securing/locking tab.Bear in mind, this is with the extended battery and while it does only add about 1.5 mm to the depth, the case is molded to fit the standard battery and cover. For this price point, if I can get months of use with an accessory not designed to fit and regularly taken on and off for cleaning, I have zero complaints.Highly recommend this item to any Droid X user.",5
"I have body glove cases on all of my phones.  My assistant keeps knocking my phones off of the desk, or off of the golf cart.  With these cases, the case takes the beating, and for the price, it is cheap insurance.  The phone has taken a tumble on asphalt, and survived beautifully.  Nothing more to say.",5
"I initially liked the protection, despite the bulk.  I dropped it twice at most and the clips started loosening.  Guess it did it's job, but just bought a seiko innocase, like it initially, but time will tell.",2
"I like the rubber material, thought it would stick when I put it in my pocket, but I haven't had a problem with it.  The fit is tight and feels solid.  My only complaint about the case is that the finish isn't great.  Looks like it could come part at the seems, but so far it's held up without any problems.  For the money it's well worth it.",4
"Love this case for the Droid X.  Snaps together easily and protects the Droid X well.  However, avoid buying from 'More'n'Less Wireless'.  I ordered 2 for the Droid X and rec'd 1 for the X and 1 for the Droid Incredible.  Seller said 'simple packer mistake'.  Ok, but the cases are not even close to the same size.  Poor attention to details.  I do biz with 'The Oem Shop' now. :-)Pros:-Non-slip rubber casing won't slide on your dash, desk etc-Has hard shell under rubber surface for added protection-Easy to unsnap for Droid Dock users-Includes solid BLANK for back of case for those who don't want belt clip option-Includes click-to-turn belt clip BLANK to add belt clip or kick stand clip-Much more affordable option to OtterBox-Allows easy access to all ports and camera lensCons:-Makes the massive Droid X even larger-Needs built in transparent screen protector similar to OtterBox-Should allow about 1/8' more room for soft keys.  Not as bad as some cases, but sometimes hard to depress the keys.Overall this is a great case for the Droid X and X2. Don't bother with those flimsy silicone cases.  My roomie has one and is constantly using my Body Glove :-)",5
Feels like very good quality for price. Snaps right on and protects good.( Had my phone fall a couple of times). Since then my wife dropped phone in water and changed phone but still use same case and still in decent condition. Also nice kickstand,5
"I wanted to protect my DroidX so dearly that i decided to get something sturdy enough and this Body Glove does it! it's a nice, snug cover for the phone. Although it makes it look somewhat bulkier when you clip it your belt, but I don't care. I don't have to carry the phone in my pocket and it's at an easy access when I need my phone. It easily comes on & off from the clip. And also comes with an option to take the clip off completely so it can lay flat on a surface. I haven't used the little stand thingy much to watch video etc. But it's a nice and sturdy feature. And I have never dropped the phone from the clip when it's on my side (like some reviews mention here). Overall, great!!!",4
I love the feel of this cover.  The grip is nice but does not stick in my pocket.  Cover snaps on solidly BUT.... I'm not sure how long the snaps will hold up.  After putting the cover on with the belt clip attachment I noticed that when I touch my screen towards the middle I see that funny distortion bubble pop up on the screen breifly.  Well I figured the belt clip insert was to blame so I took the cover off and put in the plain insert.  Same thing occured.  I'm using the LS extended batteries with an original cover so I figured the cover insert was just too much so I took the case apart again and removed the insert completly.  When I snapped the case back together I noticed one of the clips was not holding already!  Yup just 2 dissasemblies and already the clips are failing.  To top it off the removal of the insert did not help with the distortion bubble (it only appears when you touch the middle of the screen).  Well at least the price was right and I will use the cover until it starts to fail (I give it about 2 months) or the distortion bubble annoys me too much.  All in all I think that if you have the regular battery in your phone and don't plan to EVER remove this cover than it should work well.,3
"I have previously used leather cases that allowed me to remove my phone in seconds.  This case snaps together around the phone and does not come off very easily.  This means that I once I installed the case, it no longer fits into my docking cradle.  I was a bit skeptical that the case would not split at some critical moment, but it seems very secure.Overall, I would say this case is good as long as you are okay with the limitations inherent with it's design.",3
"I don't know where they got &#34;rubberized&#34; here. There's nothing rubber about it. It's hard plastic. It's not a bad case, but the hole isn't big enough to plug in your charger, so I had to widen the hole a little bit, which broke the plastic. It still works, but I'm just not a real big phone case guy. For the price, this wasn't a bad investment. Just nothing real fancy here. It won't feed your children, make women take their tops off, or rescue a nest of baby kittens from a burning alder.",3
I bought this for my father. It has lasted him about 3 years now and he just got a new one. He owns a mechanic shop so he is rough on things. It has been through the ringer! Great case,5
"I like this case, but it did need a modification to work flawlessly.  The opening for the micro USB connection is slightly too small.  My micro USB cable ends did not fit in properly.  If I held it pushed in it makes the connection, but once I let it go the connection ends.  And since I will not hold theDROID Xthe entire time it is charging, I had to modify the case slightly.  I took a very sharp razor and carefully cut the opening larger.  I am talking about maybe 1/32 of an inch.  Be very careful when doing this, because you do not want to lose a finger.  Maybe a Dremel tool would be a better choice for this operation?  It would probablt be safer, but I like danger.  Hah!This case is a two part case and it snaps together over your phone.  It is hard plastic and has a slight bit of grip to it, unlike the silicone skins that are much grippier (thats a word, right?)  The color is a bright orange, almost like International Orange, so it will match nicely with alife preserver.  The color in the picture almost looks like it is a metallic orange, but its not.  My wife hates the color, but so what, its my phone and I like the high visibility look.Overall I like the case very much.***update 11/26***  Turns out there is more than one type of micro USB plug.  My Droid came with the type that has a larger head on the micro side.  I used the cable for my wife'sSamsung Fascinatewhich has a smaller head and it fits perfectly.  Had I known that first I could have saved some time modifying this case.  good to know.",4
This cover looks like its advertised but functiuonally it stinks.  It pops off easily and made of a very cheap material.  Recommend against it,1
"I have had this case approximately 3 weeks. For the $3 price tag I am happy enough with it, however, I will soon be ordering a more expensive/better case for my droid for the following reason:1. the case is a hard plastic covered in a thin coat of rubbery film for easier gripping. The film is already wearing off in small patches on various places on the phone, so there are random patches where the color is brighter and shinier.2. The color is a brighter orange than the nice burnt orange shown in the picture3. the two sides don't fit together incredibly well. One corner in particular aligns horribly, so that the front half of the cover is 1-2 millimeters thicker than the back cover. It doesn't sound like a lot, but when you want a smooth, sleek looking cover, it definitely stands out.4. While this offers $3 worth of protection, it doesn't offer much more than that. I would rather pay a bit more and be more protected since the droid x is a pretty expensive piece of equipment.5. there are scratches in the case. I am good to my phone, haven't dropped it, etc, but the case seems to scratch easily, and in the places it is scratched, you see the white color of the underlying plastic. Scratches are very obvious.All in all, if you are just looking for the cheapest way to cover your phone, this is an excellent choice- it provides some protection and is incredibly cheap, but in the end I don't believe the cheap price is worth the poor quality.",3
This case isn't too bad. My husband broke it already the first time it hit the ground so it's not manufactured to take a heavy hit but it protected his phone like it should have!,4
"I used this for a while with my X until I got tired of the color. It was cheap and I will probably use it again. Some of the plactic started coming apart after a few months, but how long do you plan on using a skin? Most people have a bunch of skins and change them out when they get tired of them. It protected the phone just fine.",4
Love the print,5
"I bought this case because of the design, but was mind blown when I saw it in person. It is 3x better in person than it is on the computer!",5
"Nice colors, texture, and looks pretty :). Does not make the phone look fat. Easy to put on and take off.",5
This case is sooooo pretty. I LOVED IT. I just dropped my phone one too many times. & the cover broke. But the cover protected my phone.,5
"I bought it because I thought it looked pretty. When I received it, it looked just like I thought it would, pretty. Fits snug, nice design. Oh and the price is spot on. If you like it, buy it. If not, move on.",4
Not great for protection. but nice for looks. it is a plastic snap on so it sometimes pops apart. and not easy to keep together or take off once seated right,2
I love it! Fits my 4S great. Just be careful putting on because it lifted my screen protector and it got a huge air bubble...errrr!  Hopefully the design doesn't rub off as other I have purchased but for the price hey I can change it many times!,5
"It wasn't what I was thinking.  I love the print, but probably wouldn't buy it again.  Was looking for something a little more protective.",2
My mom loved this case because of its design and it fit the phone very well and provides very good protection.,5
Everyone who has seen this thinks it is amazing! The back protector is better than the front. The front one scratched up and didn't last very long. I would recommend it! Very good price also.,4
"This product was cheap, but very nice. When you lock your iPhone you get a handy little mirror. Gives your screen a bit of a rainbow effect tho. Took quite a little while to ship.",4
"Was not able to see through the screen. The phone was not responsive through the lighting sensor, the screen did not turn off when calls were being made so buttons were clicked on the touchscreen the whole time",2
"i really like the way this looks on the phone for the front and back view, makes the phone look really different",5
It came off really quick.the screen protector did not stick that good.But it is a okay product to buy if you don't mind not seeing your phone outside.,3
i atually like it alot something diffrent doesnt work in ever situation but it makes your phone stand out so u dont just have another iphone,4
"I ordered four of these covers, they all shipped very fast and work great. I work at a pool and the mirror comes in handy throughout my day. Had it for a month now and dropped my phone a lot, still no scratches.",5
"this product was what i wanted because i like to look at myself while i look at my phone for a quick face check. but when i go outside, even with the brightness all the way up, i still can barley see my screen. so i cut it to only cover the top of my phone then two days later it fell off.",2
"You can't see it outside, or in a bright room, or if your screen is turned down....just a waste of money.",1
It is high quality and looks awesome! I would definitely recommend to make your phone look more unique! Great Purchase,5
"BESIDES COMING LATE IN THE MAIL, THIS PRODUCT IS TOO CHEAP- IT RIPPED CORNERS PEELING OFF THE TOPS.. I WOULDNT BUY THIS AGAIN",2
This screen protector made it too difficult to see the screen in daylight. My son uses his phone when he runs and he found it to cause the screen to be too dark in the morning sun.,2
"I bought this for my phone and I'm very pleased with my purchase. It fits perfectly. The delivery was very fast and the quality its awesome, thank you.",5
fit perfectly and was easy to put on. stayed on for quite some time too. Love the simple pattern on the front and back. made my phone look really cool. it even had some what of a texture. I would defiantly suggest you buy this screen protector. worth every penny.,5
I had this cover on my I3 for several years.It always looked good & never broke.  My phone was amazingly protected in it.,5
"I like it because it's cute and it does protect your phone.  No instructions came but i figured it out.  Then I forgot to cover the apple logo and still don't think I've quite figured it out.  It's OK but you can tell that once you take it off, you are done since the pink outer covering, in my opinion will likely tear  Still, it's a cheap alternative for a case.  I've read that some said there was a screen protector - I didn't see one but I have my own.Some people might consider it bulky but I don't mind it.It really is cute, protects all the ports and protects the phone!I ordered the pink for me and the B & w for someone else.  They didn't like so now I have 2.",5
Was a very good price and was happy when I got it and used it a lot until I got an upgrade on my phone. Thanks,4
You need one of these if you drop your phone a lot! Works great and looks good on the phone! Super value!,5
I can not write a review on this because I never received this product.  Sorry. Wish I could help you out.  I did received a different color and was pleased with it.,3
Love the case. There are nit alot if otions for my phone but this one I love. And it was easy to put on as well.,5
"out of all the cases i have bought, this one works, feels and operates as designed, will purchase again in other colors and interchange to make my own personalized case!",5
The pink otterbox is awesome. Easy to change and protect my phone very well. This case has more than paid for its self. The price was unbeatable.,5
I loved this case I had to change my phone and it doesn't fit anymore but it worked great thanks,5
"This case is tough.  It increased the size of your phone and you will not be able to easily slide it into a pocket but at the same time, it will protect your phone.  It is a blend of hard and plastic and soft rubber.  The phone is given a little plastic 'cage' that snaps open and closed and this is covered by a close fitting rubber sheath.  It blocks out most water and takes one hell of a licking.  The only thing I would reccomend is that you still use a clear adhesive sheet over the face of your phone to reduce scratches.",5
I LOVE THIS COLOR ON MY PHONE FITS PERFECT FOR 3GS PROTECTS AND SIMILAR TO THE OTTER CASE ONLY BAD SIDE IT SHIPS INTERNATIONALLY SO TOOK LIKE 20 DAYS TO GET TO ME BUT I WAS HAPPY WHEN I GOT IT ! GOOD BUY!,5
"This protects the phone well, but charger won't fit with case on. I have to remove the case each time I charge my phone. I don't recommend this case at all.",3
Excellent and durable... this is my second one... my first last it 2 years and my phone is like brand new,5
"Worked well while it lasted, but broke only about six months after having it. But it's cheap, so that was to be expected.",3
This is the best transmitter I have ever bought! There is little to no static and the quality of the sound is almost the same as my cd's. It can even hold my iphone with a case on it and the grip is adjustable! I love it and would recommend!,5
I got the transmitter a week after I ordered it. I was a little dissapointed when both my phone and Ipod wouldn't fit unless i took the cases off. When i went to plug the thing in it wouldnt really stay on. The device has to stay sideways in order for it to work.,1
"Looked like a nice product, but the signal generated was too low.I had to turn car volume all the way up and even then it was not audible.Since I purchased another cheaper FM transmitter at the same time for another car, I was able to confirm using side by side comparison that there was nothing wrong with the phone or the car radio itself.Also, there is no memory on the device so every time it's unplugged the operating frequency resets to the base frequency.Now, there may be settings & capabilities that may have got it to work, but it comes with no manuals. So it was easier to return.The seller was supportive and I got my money + shipping back.",1
"This is a great way to easily play your iPod within your car speakers. All you do is tune your car FM radio into the set station on the FM Tuner and you're all set! It stays nice and sturdy and doesn't fall down when driving over bumps, and this is an EXTREMELY cheap price for such a fantastic item!!!There is however a couple things that I dislike about it:If you want to use the remote with your  left hand because you are driving with your right hand the remote will not work because there is too much of a distance between the remote and the receiver.. So to fix this I COMPLETELY titled and bent the top-side of the stand and faced the receiver towards my drivers side door (left). So now I can use the remote with my left hand.Another MANUFACTURING FlAW is that the iPod, iPhone etc. all have the headset jack on the bottom right of your device and the stand has two little prongs to hold your device in so it  does not fall out and one of them is DIRECTLY over the headphone hole.. And so it really creates a problem with plugging in the cord. Just messes everything up.But other than those two problems, I haven't notice anything else! I am very happy with this purchase, and look forward to using this product for a long time!",4
"Hi, i bought this as i really need a holder, player, and hands free and charger, unfortunately on every turn whether left or right and on every bump on the road it flips and falls. I almost had an accident the other day when it fell... Sound is nice. If you really want a good advice get another model, especially one that has the adapter built in it because every time you want the phone you have to take the adapter out and the hands free out and so on, it becomes a hassle to keep plugging and unplugging.",1
"So this item is fine for the price, it mostly does what it is supposed to. I like the fact that you can see the phone while it is on the stand.  Here are a few things that I am not too happy about but again, for the price, I will deal with it:1. It comes loose when going over bumps in the road.  It doesn't fall out of the lighter it just stops charging...reconnect and it is fine again.2. I have the iPhone 4 thru Sprint and sometimes when I connect my phone to the charger it gives me an error sayin that this device doesn't support charging this phone...I disconnect and reconnect and problem is usually fixed.3. FM transmitter is okay, nothing great...I can hear the music but probably something I won't use too often just because the quality of sound isn't that great. I didn't buy this product with the FM transmitter in mind but it was a nice plus to the product if I do ever need it.Overall not a horrible product...you get what you pay for.",3
"Love it! I have iphone4. Sound is great, no static. I havent used speaker phone feature. I use it for music through the car speakers It fits securely in the outlet. Charges the phone with no additional cords. Great stand so my phone isnt all over. I put my phone on the stand first thing when I get in the car.  If someone calls, you just touch to go hands free, no fumbling for the phone. I always know where my phone is, secure and in view.  The remote is useless...lol. The only thing I would have liked is a swivel feature to go from portrait to landscape for when I want to use GPS. Other then that, it is great.  Price is right.  No reason to spend more for a name brand.  Everyone should have one of these.",5
Not bad for the price.  Its cheap and does everything as advertised.You can't really ask for quality sound from FM transmitter.  You also get the usual static sound of transmitters.,3
"Bought this to place in the iPad. Item arrived very quickly. It works just as advertised. Had no problems. Good price, also.",5
Received an original AT&T micro sim card. Ordered from abe-123.I would trust them to get an original micro sim. Thanks!,5
New just as described. Unactivated upon arrival and ready to be used with any mobile phone or tablet. I recommend buying at least a couple and keeping a spare one in case you need another one.,5
I called up the AT&T support told them I for now did not want to activate a data plan and opted for 10c per min plan and they did it without asking another question...wow i like that,5
Bought this for an unlocked Iphone 5s that i bought as a Christmas gift. Item arrived as advertised and worked well.,5
"I'm updating this review because now I am getting a Sim Card locked message. I thought I was buying a new sim. What is the problem?I was hoping to get the real micro SD card but after going through a few vendors, and most recently iPadSimShop USA way too many vendors not being honest and telling you that what they're really giving you are sim cards that have been cut down to fit. While if done carefully, this will work, them not being forthright makes me wary of any other things they have to sell and questions whether its worth doing business with them again. I don't want to constantly go back and forth with the A-Z guarantee  because these people can't take the time and be honest.I can get a sim card cutter and do this myself.As of June 23 I received a GENUINE micro sim card from abe-123 for the same price that iPadSimshop sold me their cut one for. I had tried to talk with the vendor and if you look at their response to me in their feedback - they said I was 'Saving money' by purchasing a cut sim. So tell me how come this vendor can sell me the right SKU for the same price?Genuine micro sim cards use SKU - 73054 or 73052Don't believe me, check AT&T;'s website and it lists current SKUIf you get anything else demand your money back through Amazon's A-Z because it's false advertising.Thank you abe-123 for being honest with your practices.",4
I Buyed this item with no probrlems! Is an original ATT Micro Sim. Woks great. Beware with the Cutted sims. Sometimes not work! But This one is original and works great for me!,5
I bought this turn my old iPhone 4 into an iPod touch because it is required a SIM card and didn't matter if it was activated or not also save money and don't let the apple store throw it away on you. That was my mistake for listening to a new employee.,5
"UPC 6-07376-07452-1Genuine article, not micro sim cut from regular sim. Inserted in a T-Mobile phone to unlock it. Then came up as AT",5
"I've had my case for a few weeks now. I'm not very gentle with my phone (Droid x2), Ill throw it in the purse, on a chair, it falls etc. The case is made of 2 parts: front plate and back plate and they snap together. The 'suture' line doesn't bother me and the parts have never popped off accidentally. The case feels very sturdy and hard yet it's not bulky. I love the rounded corners and the material feels like a plastic-y suede (not sure how else to describe it). The color is not as bright as in the picture (electric blue). It's more of a ultramarine blue but I like it. The holes for the speakers and buttons are cut well. I have to slightly push down harder on the volume buttons since the case edges for that cut out are a little deeper but it's also not a problem for me.",5
Fits my droidx snuggly and has the same texture/feel you'd expect from a case you'd purchase from a mall kiosk. It doesn't inhibit the phones function in any way so I think that's a job well done. I have yet to drop my phone but I feel that it would do a fairly good job protecting it and for the money I paid i'm happy. Another thing I really appreciated is the fast shipping so bravo to the seller for that.,5
"This was purchased for my husband's phone and has been a great investment, it has saved his phone from an untimely death!  I would highly recommend this case for someone that tends to be careless at times and put their phone down in the strangest of places",5
"you'll need a bunch of these if you drop them.  think of them as disposable protection for your droid, that is if the phone still works.",5
"I bought it as a 'thank you' gift for my friend.  It took forever, and I would have returned it, but my friend was too polite to tell me it didn't fit until much later when she lost her phone, and I said didn't the color make it easier to fine.  She was embarrassed to say it didn't fit and never was able to use it.",1
"This fit perfectly, my girl liked it, unfortunately she lost the phone along with the cover and therefore it was a waste of money. IT's good though",5
"This case is everything it's advertised as. However you do get what you pay for. It's a cheap case, but it is so thin and light that it breaks extremely easy! I haven't had it a week yet and one of my snaps is already broken. It is only good if you never need to take it off ever again. Once you need to take it off for anything, one or more of the snaps will break. It's very cheaply made which is why it is priced so cheap. Not even worth the $3 price tag after shipping.",1
Great color and price. This was an inexpensive case and easy to order. I am pleased with my decision to order.,5
I just want to say thank you so much ..I love it and i will buy again .. thank you again..,5
"I got this thinking it would be easier to remove and install, though it is more of a permanent case. If you use docking stations this case is not the one for you. Though, if you are looking for a nice case that will not stick in your pocket and doesn't make the phone bulky, you will love it.",4
It was a speedy shipping and the cases lastest for quite awhile. I still have them even after I dropped my phone a few times. Cases never cracked. Just lost a bit of color and the corners got scratched up.,5
I was a little concerned reading the reviews before I purchased.  Ordered anyways because of the  priceIn some lights it really looks purple not blue.The rubberized finish has all rubbed off on the corners within a month.I had purchased from this seller before here on amazon and had similar results.Its really a crapshoot either its is was it is or its not (this ones not)  Sometimes they break quickly (my wifes broke in one day )Other's just don't work. (Set of chargers bought first time the wall charger drains instead of charges!!)If you like the price try it but  BUYER BEWARE! Obviously these are cheap imports and not quality tested.,2
I bought this case for my daughter....she drops her phone all the time and other cases pop off. So far so good with this one.,4
"This case is a perfect fit, the screen protector is even surprisingly good quality. The color doesn't look like the picture which is why i docked a star. It is actually closer to the front view - very BRIGHT blue, and looks purple in other lights. Ordered for my husband and he refuses to use it due to the odd color... Good choice for a cheap case though.",4
Good protection for Droid 2 Global. The first one broke when the phone was stepped on. The case cracked but the phone was fine.,5
"Sometimes you get what you pay for. This case was just not that good. I did not stay on that well, and most of all looked purple instead of blue which I hated.",2
I really like it and it works but it doesn't feel rubberized like the other ones I have bought I felt that was slightly miss information,3
"this cover did not fit my phone, when I contacted the vendor, they refunded the full purchase price and shipping.",1
Its had to put on and take off....if you slide the keyboard out it gets easier....I would prefer a gel case!,3
"This case is a perfect fit, the screen protector is even surprisingly good quality. The color doesn't look like the picture which is why i docked a star. It is actually darker and then lighter depending on the light. Good choice for a cheap case though.",4
it broke the first week i had it. it was a cheap plastic. not rubberized. i dont recommend this one. . pretty but that is it.,1
"this is a nice case, and fit well on the phone, but the surface scratched a little too easy for my liking, and one of the securing tabs broke off from the case being taken on and off too frequently",3
"I bought it for my Droid, unfortunately, it's not a Droid 2 and therefore doesn't fit. I won't send it back because the mistake was mine. I think it would be very nice on the proper phone.",3
nice color and great case,5
"Got this as a present for my mom, she loves it! She is still using it and it looks really nice on her phone! Hasn't broke or chipped like the other ones I have bought!",5
"This did not fit my phone even a little bit! The only good thing about it was that it was the color that I ordered :/ the case was smaller than my phone actually was. So instead of keeping it, I gave it away >:|",1
THIS DEVICE WORKS. i WAS UNABLE TO COME UP WITH A BETTER REVIEW FOR A SIMPLE DEVICE LIKE THIS.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.,3
"cool it was only $10, i wish it was cheaper, but at least it works. audio out and charging works fine.",4
when i got it was small.didn' even charge my ipod.Not worth the money I paid for this.Cheap but crap.Don't buy this.,2
The one i recived did not work well and didnt hold my phone to charge. But worked ok kn my husbands phone.,3
"I ordered it for the iPhone 3GS & it does not fit. On the receipt when i opened it, it said iPhone 4. It does not match the description online. It worked for my ipod 4 Generation & stopped working within a day. I tried contacting the owner for a refund & i have not gotten a reply within 48 hours. I would not recommend this to anyone.",1
"This is the perfect device for the application that I wanted to set up. With this dock plugged into power adapter and speaker system, I only need to pop my iPod touch into it and my music is playing as I want to hear it.",5
This did not work for more than a week.  Not sure why - but I did not send it back but I will not be ordering another one anytime soon.  I think the buyer knows these things don't work and happy for people like me who won't send it back because its too much of a hassle for the price you pay for it.,1
"they are actually better than expected , was expecting a real cheap thin rubber but these are exactly like otter box skin they are perfect !!!!",5
"For silicone they were well made and colorfully cute, but of course they aren't meant to protect your phone from breakage so of you're a klutz then don't buy.",5
"Love the color that they add to my wardrobe and the abilty to change frequently.  Do not fit perfectly, but it is not bad.",4
Not what I thought they were my fault thought they were the covers and they were for the hard shell cover still ok selection,3
"I purchased this product for my daughter, and she liked it. She liked to be able to chage her cases to match her clothes.",4
I never got these I was looking forward to them but it was a long time for them to tell me I wont be getting them I was upset. didn't care bout the money I wanted them.,1
"Soft and rubbery...but good in a pinch..or she can use them with the hard cover I also purchased, to change the looks of the cover. Great value for the price.",5
This set of covers works great with my otterbox and the ability to change colors at any time is so much fun,5
I love the cases!!!  I have a color for all occasions.  I even gave my friend a few of them.  It's true that some of the tab were a little big but I just got my manicure scissors and cut it to size.  You can't beat it for the price.,5
I absolutely love these 10 silicone covers for my cell phone.  I have the Otterbox Defender Case and these covers allow me to change the look to coordinate with my handbags and outfits in seconds.  The price was better than any I have seen in the mall.,5
"This is a set of ten colorful outer rubber cases that protect the Otterbox case.  It is such fun to be able to change the color by the way i feel, or the outfit I wear, or just because I like the color.  It does have some issues that are easy to fix.  The side plugs that fit into the Otterbox case directly are not exactly lined up.  I just snipped the end that was the problem and it fixed itself.  You can't beat this product for the price and the fun!",4
The covers are great if you're just looking to change up the look of your Iphone.  The whole family can have a different color at any time.  Did have to trim a couple of the tabs that fit into the plastic case but that's not a problem.,5
"This case appeared hard in the ad, but when it arrived we were pleased to see that it is a hard plastic case but the feel is a softer fell. Very nice!",5
This case was cheap but the quality coincided with that. The zebra striped scratched off right away. Would not recommend this product.,2
love this and very durable and arrived quickly and def recommend to others and its super cute loved it to the fullest,5
"Very much satisfied with this case!  It fit the 4S well, and did not interfere with any of the buttons, etc.  I droppped my phone on cement days after receiving the porduct, and the case cracked, but that is to be expected.  Very nice case!  Bought another one to replace! :D",5
i was really excited on getting this but 3 days later the zerba stripes started fading away and before i knew it it was turning silver i wasn't a big fan of this case.,2
This case was just as described and it looks very nice.  The only thing about it that I didn't like was that I dropped my phone on carpet with hardwood underneath and the corner of the back cover chipped off and now it won't stay closed on the bottom.,4
This product was a lttle to cheap. The second I try taking if off it broke on me. so i had to get a new one.,2
I loved this case I love anything zebra print but after awhile it did start to get nasty and gross,4
i love this case it was the first of four that i recieved and used for 3 weeks i love that it has a slight pinl tint to it and that it also has a soft feel,5
"This case looks good (according to my wife) but I have to reiterate what others said re: sharp edges, imperfect mold casting and general cheap quality.  Look - it's a cheap, temporary hard case, you get what you pay for in these things. I used an Otterbox Defender for my iPhone and loved it-but it's certainly not going to win any fashion awards.  I don't think this case offers much protection (i.e. when dropped, etc), but since form > function according to wifey standards, that's the way the cookie crumbles as they say...",2
Gave as a gift and it was picked out of several. Don't know how much it is used. It is a nice change of pace.,3
"My daughter got this case, and for the most part it was a good case but fell apart within a month",3
it looks great on my phone and i like it very much its just so nice to make it match,5
"I can't get it to snap into each other because a connector piece is missing. I was given a refund, but I really like this case. I think I may buy another just to see if it will come the same. I like the feeling of the case, and I wish it would connect. I really love the feel of this case though.",3
"Love this case. Went on easy, kind of a pain to get off (but that's kind of the point, right?) Definitely rec commend.",5
I bought this case because it matched my purse and it was perfect.  Only con it did get dirty fast.,5
I like it and its just as its described in the caption but it started to loose the color on the edges really quick it was gone on the 2-3 day of use.i would recommend if you don't mind it but  I just cant sorry and also I like that its a two piece cover front and back  ....:),3
I got it and put it on right away lol!! Its soooooo pretty on my iphone :) I love it! I reccomend everybody who likes zebra print or any animal print to get this!!,5
The price on this was awesome. The shipping didn't take too long. But the product was kinda cheap looking but good for the price. Happy overall.,5
"overall the case is alright, although cheaply made but for the price what can you expect? but the case did arrive with a piece broken out of the bottom and nowhere to be found, so it was clearly not the postal service at fault.",2
still in pretty good condition it gets color from other things (jeans) but its still pretty decent looking and works fine,4
"Love this case, so cute and fun to change your cases with your clothing. Protects my phone from slipping from my hands.",5
"This case is good for the price. It is cheaply made but does look cute on your phone.  I probably wouldn't buy again, but again it was cute for the price.",3
The picture for this item is wrong. I received a broken case & it surrounds the screen which is very ugly to  me.I do not recommend this!?!!!!,2
"I will never get a white case, but sucks because I love this case. There was no other colors available so I got this. It did fit my 4s, but was so easy to get dirty. I no longer use this.. but I loved it when I did. =)",4
It came weeks early through the mail and some paint was already scratched where the plastic snaps shut but not real evident-big deal.  Its definitely not 'HIGH' quality case...but if you would expect this for the whole whoppin $1 and FREE shipping you are out of your mind. Its a decent plastic case and looks cute. Its smooth and shiny and the zebra print is cute. I dont expect it to last forever but I like to change cases frequently so Im perfectly OK with that. If you want a high quality case to last an eternity then this probably shouldnt be your choice but it seems like it would protect it in an average fall/drop and in your purse probably. Now if you want a cute acessory w/average protection from everyday wear n tear type stuff then go for it-its a whole $1! Just dont go bashing it in reviews cuz its bound to have imperfections-you get what you pay for.,3
This is a cute item.  Easy to find phone when I lay it down.  I would recommend this item to family and friends.,4
"ORDERED THIS FOR MY NEICE. IT COMES WITH 2 PIECES, FRONT FRAME THAT ATTAHCES TO BACK PIECE. ITS A HARD PLASTIC MATERIAL, KINDA CHEAPY. THE 1ST TIME WE TRIED TO TAKE IT OFF THE PHONE, A PIECE BROKE OFF! LOL..GOOD WHILE IT LASED, CHEAP PRICE.",3
fit well and continued to keep it print on the products. i would definitely buy another one. no issues what so ever.,5
I wish I had something nice to say but I don't. I'm really hoping this gets sent. This was suppose to be a Christmas gift!,1
The pictures online look better than it does in person. It does its job and is affordable. Nice little touch for a female.,4
This case was described as being hard but not rubberized and that is the only thing I didn't like about the case because the white parts of the case got dirty really quickly.,3
"after awhile, it takes the color of your jeans pocket, if that is where you keep it.it stays together very well, though.",3
I love this one. I use it all the time! It stays on perfectly and I've had no problems with it.,5
"I LOVE THIS CASE IT IS GREAT, I WOULD DEFINITLY ORDER FROM YOU GUYS AGAIN. THIS IS A GREAT PROTECTOR CASE AND WORKS VERY WELL WITH MY PHONE.",5
"This is good iphone case for iphone 4 and 4s.  When it arrived, my daughter loved it.  It has a perfect fit.  The surface is smooth and got a velvet soft touch.  The zebra pattern is cool too.  Should have bought a couple more in case this one wears out.The only downside is that this seller is shipping it from Hong Kong and it will take a bit long.  And it is not trackable.....you kinda have to take it with blind faith that it is on its way.  But, it did show up in my regular mail box, and i am more than happy to see it.",5
I bought this for a friend's iPhone and she loves the protection and style that it offers. Snaps on easily and feels tough!,5
This is a very nice phone case. The only complaint I have is how hard it is to take off when you want to switch cases. You almost have to break it to get it off. But still worth the money!,5
This is a fun zebra case for my iphone.  I love the zebra design that is so popular.  This case is very affordable.,5
For anyone who loves animal prints this phone case is ideal. it came very timely and looka just like the picture! i love love love it,5
Shipped very quickly. Loved the zebra theme. Very smooth surface. Fit my iPhone 4 perfectly. The black parts did chip slightly after a month or so. Nothing too noticeable. Protected phone very well.,3
thank u .. happy .. same as pic xx xx xxxx xxx xx xx xx xxdx xx xx xx x x,5
Fits my iPhone 4 perfectly and is pretty solid so feel like it will protect well if dropped or anything.,5
"This case was the first BodyGlove product that I have been dissatisfied with since I bought my first BodyGlove product back in 1998. Previous to this, it has been a requirement for me that a new phone should have a BodyGlove case available for it if I were to buy it.I could not get the case to snap shut on the phone. It was not obvious to me how to do it, and there were no instructions included. The construction of the case was not as sturdy as other BodyGlove cases that I have used. The plastic was flimsy compared to the stitched leather that I was used to. I did not have confidence that it could protect a $500 phone from drops. There is no padding inside the case. BodyGlove may be irrelevant in the smartphone generation. The construction techniques that worked with soap-bar phones with small screens just don't apply to a phone that is all screen.I bought a rubber skin for my phone and a horizontal pouch case. This provides the kind of protection that I was looking for. BodyGlove was good to me while it lasted. I'm sorry to see it end.",1
"Don't you love the free market and the positive competition it provides for!&lt;Disclaimer> SF|Planet was kind enough to add a small note asking for a positive review, making absolutely sure I was 100% satisfied, and links for other products.&lt;/Disclaimer>That having been said, I was genuinely satisfied and will gladly review SF|Planet first, the product second.I got the item when they promised. They even sent me an email saying that there was a short delay in filling the order, but that they would do what they could to get it there on time despite that. It did arrive on time, and I did smile.That is good customer service! COMMUNICATIONSecond, the price was about 1/2 of what it would cost at the store. S/H was reasonable as well (many companies will sell an item for $1 and then charge $9.99 for S/H; SF|Planet is not like that, they treated me fairly)Now the product: Body Glove 9147301 Flex/Chrome Snap-On Case for Samsung Vibrant (and Galaxy S).1. I am very impressed with the quality and design. It is first rate.2. The clip/stand is a cool idea. I've been hesitant to use belt clip cell holders because of past brush by tear-offs, but this one feels more secure.3. The rubberized grip back is awesome. It doesn't hang up in the pocket of my jacket, but has enough tack to make an otherwise slippery phone very usable now.4. Body Glove lost me several years ago with a few that just didn't stack up, but then most product design was still struggling. BodyGlove has won me over with this great product.",5
perfect weight to a super light phone..doesn't obstruct any nature of the phone and its look is sweet. i seen this case on other sights ranging from $29.99 to $39.99..this was BY FAR a steal.,5
"Snapped together on my phone fairly well. Corner locking tabs did not quite latch together properly. I had to shave a bit of plastic away with a sharp knife to get one of the corners to properly latch. Rubber coating is great but starts to peel away from use, in and out of pockets.",3
"This case did not fit my phone. once received, I tried to snap it on and into place, but it kept popping off! so before I tried anything else I just returned it.  :(",1
"This is a great product. It sits good on the vent and secures the phone snug. The bottom is wide enough to attach sync cable while driving. It doesn't wobble its well built.Update: June 13, 2013Stopped adjusting after a month. I had to jerry rig to keep it working. Finally the jerry rigging gave out and i trashed it after having it a total of 2 mths.",1
"What sets this apart from other similar products is that it fits all iPhone models with or without a case. Note that there is no chance of the mount falling from the vent if fastened correctly or phone falling out of the mount itself. It is extremely sturdy, with two leathery clasps on two sides and supportive movable plastic pieces below it. Two simple buttons on each side of the mount easily release the iPhone from the mount, for easy comings and goings. The charger plug also fits easily into the bottom of the phone, between the supportive plastic pieces. There is also circular mechanism in the back of the mount that allows you to move to a navigational view (90 degrees). You can re-tighten the mechanism after you move it.It is worth mentioning that we have 3 of these in the family and one has a small issue with tightening in the navigational view. I am not sure if that is a product issue or a random event, given that the other two don't have the same problem. Either way, I would recommend it. Very useful.",4
Is a good little holder and fits practically any size phone with case! Easy to position and sits on top of the air vent lip perfectly. Problem is that it blocks the vent coming to my face so it's not great in that aspect. Also some of the rubber is starting to peel off from all the put-in/take-out; but is still going strong. Would buy another when mine goes kaput.,5
"I love the concept of this product but you have to handle it with care. The clamps can easily break in the air vents. Also, the clamps that adjust to the phone sides can become stuck if they are placed in the tightest position. Registering the product online with the company is very important for new clamps or other replacement parts. For the price, it's good enough.",4
I read a lot of reviews trying to figure out which item I should bur for my Smart Phone. This product had the best rating that I could find.  I ordered it and I have to say I was surprised by how well made it was. You can adjust the arm and use horizontally or vertically. After seeing it in person my husband wants one as well. It took me a while to get the hang of how to attach and detach the mount on the vent but after I got the hang of it it was a piece of cake. I have already used this a few time and love it.  Good purchase!,5
Best vent mount I ever used. Sits securely with no 'play' in it. Also holds iPhone far enough out so as not  affected by heating or air conditioning coming from vent.  The best part is that this has push buttons on each side which makes the sides expand so that I am not tugging to get the iPhone out. Highly recommend.,5
"This is a good quality stand and it fits most phones. I hated that my wife was looking at her phone in her hand while driving. So at least with this she's looking to the side. Anyways, it's easy to setup and has good grip, so your phone stays in there. The only problem is that it clips to the AC/heater vents, and it's kind of hard to adjust to the exact position you want.",4
I like this thing so much I do not leave home without having it in my pocket Although it is not fit into my pocket but at lease I could clip on my but pocket,5
"I tried one other screen protector before this one but I was disappointed because it left air bubbles on the screen.  this protector is easy to apply.  The instruction was clear and easy.  my screen looks the same, the protector is barely noticeable.  Thanks for making a great product.",5
"Loose, it stinks lie a sub sandwich and its uber-loose. you get what you pay for...I aid almost nothing and got almost nothing in return.",1
"very nice design and nice material. I misread and assumed it had both covers. it was very good, would recommend it both read  fine print",3
My wife wanted a case that was clear so that she could show the back side which she loves. She has a body glove case so I bought her this one which ended up being a mistake. This is a two piece case where the front snaps onto the back but the problem is that they wouldn't stay shut. The corners would pop open all the time so we took the whole thing off and put the body glove back on. Do not buy!!,1
"These are not terrible, but I have definitely seen better for less money (for other phones).Pros:-For the parts of the screen they do cover, they fit perfectly for the Galaxy 4g s.-Still much cheaper than purchasing in a store.Cons:-They don't cover the buttons on the bottom and were not cut to fit perfectly on top around the speaker (instead it is just a huge cut out as depicted in the photo.-At $3 for a pack of 3, they cost about 2 to 3 times more than some other screen covers I have purchased for other phones on amazon (still much cheaper than in the store).-They have a really sticky feel to them (especially when you first apply them). Your finger will not swipe smoothly over them at first. After a while it gets better.-Each screen protector is individually wrapped, and does not come with an applicator (no big deal, can use credit card). You do get a cleaning clothe which each screen though.Unfortunately there are not a lot of screen protector options out there for the Galaxy 4g s. So if you need a cover for yours this is not a terrible option, but hopefully some better ones will come out in the future.",3
Great case. I bought them for my daughters and they loved them. Plus neon is in! Fashion forward...I've ordered from this company in the past and I will continue to do so.,5
"The great thing is that it fits tight, but still is easily removed.All the holes line up with what they are supposed to and the covered buttons still work easily.A lot cheaper than buying it at a retail store.",5
"I bought this hoping for something sturdier. I was greatly dissapointed to find that it was so flexible. While I am sure this would have prevented scratches if phone was dropped from a moderate level, it slid off the phone every time it was pulled out of my pocket. Go with a rubber case instead.",3
"This is a plastic 2 piece case in a flex gel coating, not one you slip over the corners of the phone.",4
"Do not get me wrong, for the price I can not ask for much but the cover slips off the phone here and there so it can be a little frustrating but otherwise it is still cute!",4
"I like this case and still have it although, I have a new phone now. The case is still intact and not stretched out. Good buy.",4
"I wanted something that I can attach to the inside of my purse.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  The holster will not hold the phone with a case on it, but this is perfect for me.  Couldn't beat the price.",5
the case was niiceee!!! it pertected my phone until my next upgrade thank you case!! it fits works well and it nice and soft,5
"The price was cheap, the case fit good.  It's not as tacky as I wish it was, Silicone is a little too smooth.  Protects the phone.",4
It fit great and also the color was awsome and the silicon wipeable feel is wonderful! Shipping took 7days though but that's my only complaint,4
The phone won't slide in and out of my pocket with this on!  Great for holding and color coordinating.  I don't use it anymore.,3
"does what it says it will do. typical screen savers with time they scratch and fade, but for the price its supposes to do that.",5
"Its a cute case but it is just one piece that covers the back, nothing to protect the front screen.  So if you are looking for something protective I wouldn't recommend this case.",2
She couldn't wait until her case came and she loved it and now I have to order her a a different case because her phone stopped working,3
Case came in the mail broken and would not stay on my phone because of that. Also the edges were jagged.,1
This case sucks.  The upper half of the phone is not protected and nothing actually holds the phone in the case.  Even if you put it in your pocket upside down the phone will fall out when you pull it from your pocket.  I almost dropped my phone once and it just slip out of the top of the case and fell on the floor.  There should be a little strap over the top or something... I guess whoever designed this case never actually used it...  When you plug your phone in to sync or charge the force of this motion causes the phone to shoot out of the top of the case.,1
"This review is for the black leather case.  The black case comes in your choice of leather or silicone.  White, pink or red only come in the silicone option.The AmazonBasics Leather Case for the iPhone 4 is just as exactly described with no misrepresentations.  It is a basic real leather case that will fit your iPhone snugly in place.  Comes packed in a small cardboard box with no hard plastic to fight with.  The Lamb leather is rigid which makes the outer shell more durable than having a softer outer shell.  The scent of genuine leather is present.  It was easy to slide the iPhone in and out, the cutouts line up perfectly with the iPhone's controls for easy access.I just wish it had some kind of carry strap or clip to attach it on my purse or waist.",4
"What an amazing value.  This case is tremendous for the money; it is among the highest quality iPhone 4 cases I have seen (I bought the leather version).  It has a leather finish, but is hardened along the back and around the front bevel, affording excellent protection.  Furthermore, the interior of the case has a soft material (a la iPad 2 smart cover) which prevents scratching from things like sand - a significant improvement in my experience.I love the open design.  It allows superior access to all ports and switches, and allows you to use the phone exactly the way it was designed.At first glance it looked a little thicker than other cases when put on, but this is apparently more illlusory than anything else (the case does not appear to hug the phone like some of the sliders).  However, I compared it to the thinnest case I own, made by incase, and the measurements were in fact nearly identical.  My only potentially negative note is that because the front protrudes from the screen, it does stop your finger from smoothly sliding off and on the phone.  However, the trade-off is that this same design aspect gives significantly more protection.  This is more of a preference for the individual as to what is more important.I would recommend this case at any reasonable price.  At this low price, it is a solid and practical case that most would like to have as an option.",5
"This case is hard leather with a felt backing and appears to be of good material and well made.  It has cut-outs at the bottom, top and back for access to controls and ports.  The thickness adds protection at a slight increase in bulk, that is less 'slimness' -- but not enough to be an issue in my opinion. It has a quality appearance.Functionally, it does add protection, but it also encumbers the iphone a bit around the edges.  It is easy enough to slip the iphone out of the case if necessary and then return it.  It might be an issue for some, probably not for others.  Sort of depends on how you use your iphone.This will fix the antenna issue and give added protection to your iphone.  It looks nice and has a quality feel.",3
"The leather is a nice quality leather.  All the edges are reinforced.  All the peripheals are left open.  This is one snug fit, though and getting it off is a bit of a dance routine.  It doesn't weight much, either.  I would have liked a screen protector, though to provide more protection.  No belt clamp, either but that makes slipping it into another sleeve (such as a purse/courrier bag, etc) easier.This is a solid, basic leather case.",4
"The AmazonBasics leather case for iPhone 4 is an elegant, hard shell leather case that offers some minimal protection to the phone. The interior of the case is lined with velvet fabric and the exterior is covered with real leather with the AmazonBasics logo imprinted on the lower back.The case fits the phone well. All the controls, camera and connectors are fully accessible while in the case. Since it's ABS hard shell case, it does add to the overall thickness of the phone but it's never bulky in the hand. However, some people may find the border of the case may interfere with using the touch screen. I found that to be a plus since the case raise the touch screen above surface when you put the phone face down.The leather case comes in a frustration free package. Took me like 3 seconds to cut open the paper seal and open it. No clamshell or unnecessary plastics to cut open and dispose of. Very environment friendly.",4
"This leather case looks great on an iphone. It's a snug fit and the back is hard enough to protect the iphone. My only concern is that there's nothing at the top of the case to prevent the iphone from sliding out. Granted, you do have to shake it quite a bit to get it out of its case. Usually, there's enough friction to prevent it from just sliding out. Still, it worries me a bit. It's such a simple design flaw and I hope Amazon fixes it soon.",4
What do you get your boss for Christmas? Can't be too extravigant or too cheap... A leather case for her I phone is just right. She was very pleased.,5
"I am reviewing this AmazonBasics iPhone 4 hard leather case throught the Vine program.  This means that I am getting the product prior to its public release to provide feedback to the user community.  I can summarize that overall this is a nicely made iPhone case.  It affords good protection to the phone and has a good grip in the hand.  However as with any phone case, it makes the phone bulkier and less cool looking.  Not knowing what the final retail price will be, it is hard to judge the value.  If Amazon.com sells it for about fifteen, it should be a good value.Construction:This is a hard case.  There is a thin frame (made of ABS so it is strong) that forms the hard shell.  The outside of the frame and the rims are covered with real leather.  The leather grains are fine so it is good quality.  The inside of the case is lined with velvet fabric to avoid scratching the phone.Fit:The case fits the phone well.  The top rim is slightly thicker than the side rims, but still does not block too much.  There are openings for the control buttons, head phone jacks, charge plug and camera lens.Operation:The features that I like are: 1) The phone is no longer slippery in my pocket; 2) All controls can be easily reached; 3) No interference with the light sensor for auto brightness or with the proximity sensor for locking the touch screen while the phone is held near the face.Appearance:An iPhone 4 fitted with this case still can be easily recognized as an iPhone 4.  The case appears to be of good quality so the user does not look 'cheap'.  On the other hand, this case makes the phone significantly thicker.  It is not as cool looking as a transparent case or bumper.Packaging:The Amazon certified frustration-free packaging is great.  There is only one paper seal to break.  No clamshell hard plastic case to cut and no plastic bags to tear open.  The case is stored in a self-sealing plastic bag.  Both the box and the bag can be reused for other purpose, or be recycled.  I wish more products are packaged this way.Overall I think this is a good product.  For my age group (35+) the cool factor is not that important, so I give it a 5 star rating.",5
This is a very stylish case for my phone.  I like the feel of it as opposed to those cheaply made silicone ones.  It also feels like will outlast the phone itself.  But I think my favorite part was that AmazonBasics is very easy to open.  No clamshell packaging to cut myself on.,5
"Tried this out on a friend's iPhone 4, as my iPhone 3GS contract isn't up. I will update after I've switched iPhones.-Very nice looking, elegant even as other reviewers have said. Fits the iPhone well allowing access to ports as needed. Easy to use the phone with the cover in place. For me, so far, no downside. Looking forward to putting it to use on my iPhone 4!",5
"This case is nothing special. The leather looks ok, but it is basic.  I don't like the open design on the top. It wouldn't protect the phone at all if it falls out of the case when you drop it. I like frustration free packaging.Edit: 6/6/11 The phone does fall out of the open top....This is a good design, if you are sometimes using a juice pack as it is easy to swap it out.",3
"Like the case, good protection the only part that isn't covered other than screen is the top where the power button it tends to slide out a bit at times",3
"I love this case. It definitely compliments the phone in every way, and I love the feel and grip of it. This is a very low price for such great quality of a case.",5
I'm reviewing this as a member of the Vine program.  Sure I paid zero for this.  Glad I did.  The interior isn't very smooth.  The outside is poorly made.  I would be rather concerned about scratching.  I wouldn't let this item touch my iPhone if you paid me.I wanted to see how much it would cost the average consumer and found out that YOU CAN'T EVEN ORDER IT!  I'm an 'employee' of Amazon and they're having me review a product that can't even be purchased!  Shame on Amazon for doing this!  I'm disappointed in you.There are way too many other cases out there you can buy (that are actually available) and I highly suggest looking elsewhere (like you have a choice).  Happy shopping.,1
"The case is nice.  It feels like it does a great job protecting my iphone and I like the look of it.  But, I slightly prefer my bumper instead because the hard case adds a higher border around the phone.  Since I do mostly texting, the higher border interferes with reaching the very bottom row of the Qwerty keyboard.  Of course, the case adds some bulk to the phone also.  I've gotten used to the slim line of the bumper, so prefer that.  It's not being able to reach the bottom row for texting that's a problem.",3
I own several AmazonBasics products and have never been disappointed in them.  This hard IPhone case is no exception.  Made of soft lambskin with velvet lining this is a hard case for your IPhone 4.  I have also used it on my IPod 3G.  The fit on both products is excellent and the price is right for such a high end built product.  Highly recommended!,5
"Amazon got it right with this one.  The design is simple.  Slide it in and slide it out.  Once you put your phone in, it is protected with the soft, yet durable leather.  It holds your phone very securely and the glove-tight design won't let it go.  I recommend this case especially for users with no screen protector as the outer edge of the front provides a thin buffer between the counter top and your iPhone screen should you lay it face down, preventing numerous scratches.The feel is good and it easily slides in and out of my pocket, unlike rubberized cases which hang when pulling it out of my pocket.  The design will alleviate the iPhone 4 antenna issue and the frustration free packaging was nice to see.Highly recommended.",5
"This is a very good and solid case for the iPhone 4.  It doesn't quite feel like leather...maybe something like hard pleather, but it definitely feel quality.  It's very solid and all the openings are in the right places so that you can get to all the necessary controls.  The inside is lined to protect your phone as well and it would do well to absorb some shock and protect the phone from damage.  There is no protection for the screen, but that allows you to have full access to the screen.  Your phone slides in from the top and it fits quite securely in there.  I had some concern on whether or not the phone would fall out of it since it just slides in, and if you shake it, the phone does come out a little, but not much.  The lining and the fit helps to hold it in quite securely.  I would recommend this product.  It's well made, looks and feels good, and does the job well.",4
"This is my favorite iPhone case, and I continue to use it, but there is a flaw.Pros:  Very slim, thin, excellent to hold, not overly sticky like rubber or silicon cases that are tricky to get into pocket, has holes to prevent heat buildup, LOOKS GREAT -- very classy (turns heads!), provides some protection, fits iPhone 4 perfectly, easy to install and remove, edges rise just above the screen so screen does not touch table if you lay it face down or it falls on side.Cons: Not as protective as most heavier, thicker cases.FLAW: The thin strip over the volume button breaks very easily.  My first one broke after a few months.  You can still use it after it breaks but the top is a little less secure.Bottom Line:  At $25 or more I would be hesitant to buy this case, because it may not last more than a few months.  At a price of $10 shipped (currently on Amazon) I don't mind the risk because I LOVE this particular design.",4
I love how this make's holding my iphone easier because of the textured case with a rubberized feel.  I also had another case which seemed to keep the phone very warm when charging.  Between dropping that case and it cracking I moved to this.  I did also crack this but it was in attempting to remove it while cleaning it.  I had dropped it and it had taken a lot of abuse.  It was so great that I bought it twice.,5
"i hate cases like these; the photos almost seem like they provide some surface coverage, but they don't.It is maddening that cases are made to cover everything, but the face, the most important part.It's pretty, but I would never buy again.",1
Worked perfectly and it's a good thing to have around. Fast shipping great communication and all around A++++++++ SELLER!!!!Trusted and like I said a rop amazon seller!!!! I'll def be back for business!!! The best case I've purchased since ifrogz clip on and the stealth predator,5
Bought a case similar to this a while ago.... It finally got old and I had to replace... This case didn't last too long and was a little more expensive than the last case. Bad buy.... Dust polka dots the back of your phone... One edge broke off... Spend a little more on a sturdier case if you are clumsy. Looks cool tho!,3
"my dad hates cell phone cases that make his phone bulky and annoying, so i found this case and he absolutely loves it.  Fits snug and protects the phone plenty.  Most people dont know that new phones are engineered to take quite a beating, so you only really need to protect the case from dents and scratches!I ended up ordering a similar case for my phone the next week.",5
This is a great looking case. Offers scratch protection and some screen protection. The sides do go up a little past the lip so it will not scratch the screen if you place it face down.The only problem--a big one--is that it breaks easily. The little plastic bar above the volume buttons broke after a month. I cut it off with fingernail clippers and filed it down.  Works okay now but I am going to get a new case.,1
"It is a good product at a good price. Good design, very thin and light. The opening for the camera and flash is a good size, with other cases flash photos came out blue, this does not happen. I highly advised this product.",4
"I normally only post reviews when a product is great or horrible; this product is great.  I really like the way it retains the iPhones slim profile while giving you something to grip.  If you drop your phone a lot, it may not be the case for you.  It offers basic protection, but is much more minimal than other cases.  I have had a 100 iPhone cases and this is one of my favorites ... I'm thinking about getting another in a different color.",5
I had a new phone for about three weeks before dropping it for the first time.  Guess what?  It broke and I through this case away and bought an OtterBox.  Saving $10-$15 dollars will cost you 20 times that down the road.,1
"I had to get a case for my mom she just got herself this new iPhone she wanted something basic and neutral. This was a great buy on my part considering how much they go for at a retail at&t store. It fits great, easy to put on, and works like it should.",5
I have purchased a number of different cases/bumpers (Apple) for my iPhone 4.  This one I have kept on the longest and have been using day after day.Some of the others started to show wear within days.  Others didn't feel 'right.'This one is great.  It has little holes all over which help the phone keep cool when it gets warm.So far so good.The one thing I don't like about any of the cases I have purchased so far is that you can't put the phone in the Apple dock with them on.  Not the case's fault.  Just an observation.All in all I like this case and it does a good job.  Feels good to hold and is lasting more than some others i have used.  Has a nice lip to help protect the screen when you lay the phone down screen side down.,5
"Very low profile, snug fit and as far as protection I would say 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.  The mesh like case allows the shine from the iPhone to come through at certain angles, very cool.  It goes on and comes off easy enough for those of us who have to use a battery case daily.  If you are looking for supper protection look elsewhere, but for some protection, great looks and low profile, this is the case.",5
"I purchase cases for our companies fleet of iPhones.  I have tried many other types and brands of cases and was using the iFrogz brand before i found these.  They fit the phone nicely, are just 'sticky' enough to not fall out of your hand while using, and are perfect for sliding in and out of your pants pocket without binding.  The holes on the back of the case allow for more heat to escape when using power-hungry apps like navigation and streaming.The only flaw, in my opinion, is the part of the case by the volume/silent switch.  The design leaves a thin strip of plastic along the edge closest to the screen.  In a vast majority of phone cases coming back to me for replacement, this is where it cracks first.  Some people live with it for a while until it starts getting annoying by binding on clothes or snaps off completly.All in all, 4 stars because of the fit, design, and price.  This is our new standard in our office.  Just make sure you have a backup when the thin corner piece breaks, and it probably will.",4
Stylish but offers very minimal protection.Do not buy this case if you're someone who is prone to dropping their phone.I've had two of these cases and the area that is most prone to breaking is right above the volume buttons.It will and can snap off if dropped in the wrong way,4
I have had this case for a couple mouths and broke it it is okay I guess i wish that this was more durable but cant complane i guess,3
For the price i can't really complain about the quality but they don't last super long. It looks pretty cool but I have had this for about 5-6 months and it is chipping apart near the volume buttons. I would buy it again though.,3
"The looks and feel of this case is great.  I know a few others that have bought this cover because they liked the way it looked on my iPhone and all have the same problem...  My main gripe is after a week or two of use the sides occasionaly start to detach and you have to snap thne sides back on the phone, almost like someone is bending the case and it doesnt fit very tight anymore.  Other than that very nice looking case.",3
This case has such a nice cushion it has saved me many times over. I just wish there were more colors to choose from. The ones they have are so masculine.,5
"At first this case was great. It fit well, looked good and most importantly protected the phone... and was open at the bottom allowing for docking with the case on. However after just 2 weeks of light use, the thin section by the volume control broke. I don't even take the case on and off, so not sure why, but I saw other reviews of the exact same thing happening so I guess it's normal.Too bad, because except for this the case was really nice.",2
"This case looks very elegant and cool. However, it doesn't fit firmly to iPhone 4 or 4s because both sides top and bottoms are open. YOu can feel iPhone can slip out if you don;t hold the case tightly. I think the material used is not strong enough to provide enough support. In fact, I have to return it and buy another one from Elago. I don;t recommend to buy this case for you iphone although it is relatively cheap.",3
"I read the reviews before buying and decided to go for it... It is a nice case, I get compliments on it all the time and people take it off to look at it because they like it so much. I've been using it for about two weeks now and still love it! I don't think it would be ideal if you are working outside in the dirt or anywhere around dirt really, but for the casual lifestyle (not working outside all the time), and just doing reg. outside activities, it seems like a good choice for a case.I occasionally do mechanic work and some outdoor activities such as 4wheeling and sports and would probably be comfortable leaving it in this case since I am usually careful about using my phone in non-electronic-friendly environments... But if you are buying this case expecting to protect it from dirt and falls... I would advise you to look at something else as this is just a case for keeping the back protected from scratches and small bumps like something hitting it while in your pocket. Overall it is an good quality product that both looks and feels great while not adding bulk to the phone and allowing you to use it with things that plug into the phone. Also a good price.",5
"Used it for about 6 months.It works well, but has the following flaws:1. Vibrates and buzzes when you're driving with no phone2. After some use, the bottom latches break from the strain of using them to support your phoneBought 2 iOttie holders to replace them and never looked back.",1
"I drive about 2000 miles a week, which means I basically live in my car. I have tried half a dozen or more car mounts for my iPhone 4. This is the best of all that I have tried. The suction cup is big and sticky. The ball mount gives you swivel in all three axis with a minimum of hassle. You can set the tension on the ball to the tightness you prefer. The rigid bar eliminates the annoying bounce/shake that plagues the Kensington and WalMart mounts. The fingers that grab the phone are easily adjustable left and right so you don't have to block the power or headphone ports on the phone. What isn't necessarily obvious from the pictures is that the bottom of the mount is spring loaded to tension the phone. It is quite secure, yet very easy to remove the phone when you leave the vehicle. You could position the phone so as to not block the camera, but you'll still be shooting a lot of the suction cup. All of the mounts I tried had an issue with that, but I am not shooting traffic stop videos with the phone so I really don't care. I am very pleased and would recommend this product to anyone. The only thing I would add is a cord clip to the back of the mount so my cables didn't fall away when I remove the phone. I use a grocery twist tie for this on mine.",5
"This is the first phone holder I've found that actually is designed to fit a slim phone. Most of the phone holders out there have fingers that are an inch or more in length, and would be more at home holding a big bulky phone rather than the ubiquitus smart phone. Also comes with a disk that you can stick on your dash to mount the suction cup on if you don't want to put the device on your windshield. All in all a good product at a good price.",4
This product is great! The suction cup is very strong and does not come loose from the windshield. The 'legs' that hold the phone in the device slide left/right to avoid buttons. At first the positioning of the legs was such that it would push in the iPhone power switch and it kept activating the 'Slide to power off' screen. By sliding the leg the situation was remedied! This device also fits my girlfriend's HTC Droid Incredible perfectly! The device is spring loaded and adjusts to the height of the phone. I'm pretty confident most new smart phones would fit great in here. It's very easy to adjust the angle and switch a phone from portrait to landscape.,5
"I'm giving it 4 stars because it sticks very well and it's doing its job. It's cheaply made and will break quickly. But it was cheap, so what did I expect? Until it breaks, I'm happy with it.",4
"This was perfect for what I needed.  I recently switched from using a standalone GPS to using a GPS app (Waze) on my phone, so I needed a new mount that would fit my phone.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Proclaim and I have a jelly case on it, which adds a decent bulk to its size.  This mount fits my phone perfectly using the longer set of prongs.  If my phone was bigger, it would still fit though; the body of the mount stretches.My GPS mount was a friction mount, so it sat on top of my dash.  I didn't want to have that visible of a sign to would be thieves that there was a GPS to steal inside, so I moved it every time I parked, which was a pain.  Since this mount has a suction cup, I was able to attach it to the glass over my temperature gauge.  My car is new and runs beautifully, so I won't be needing to pay attention to that gauge for several years.  Now I'm able to keep the mount in place all the time and my phone sits right in front of me, where it's most convenient to look at it.",5
"Super easy to put the iPhone in and remove it out of this mount, and yet it is very secure in this freely turning mount! Love this holder, especially since I have had some bad experiences in the past with others.",5
"Sometimes I wonder if products are ever tested anymore.  This is horrible.  Not only does it not stay stuck to the windshield, but it is definitely not for the iPhone 4.  The top fingers have to be moved off-center or else it will press the power button in.  The bottom fingers are also in the way.  If I plug in the power cord, the fingers block both speakers.  To make matters worse, when the phone is not in the mount, the fingers fall out and I have to hunt for them.",1
My main concern when I was looking to buy a windshield mount I wanted it to be slim and VERY secure. This meets and excels my expectation. Very slim and very secure. People said it was too tight and couldn't fit with a case but I didn't experience that. Both my husband and I have the iPhone 4s. He has a bumper and I have a case and it worked great with both. The only 'issue' I experienced was that the prong that holds the phone in place would accidentally lock my phone. But I just moved the prongs a little and that fixed the issue. Wish I needed another one so I could buy another one!,5
Great product.  Works as advertised.  If you want to hold your phone in place. It surely does that.,4
Great product - totally solid and stays sealed to the windshield. Love how functional it is. I would recommend it to my friends.,5
"My fiance loves this product for in his work van. He never has any problems with it, it is top quality",5
"It's difficult to use just one hand to remove your phone if traveling, whether you should do that or not, its difficult.",2
"I was looking for a way to mount my phone in my car. I have an iPhone4 with a hard shell case. I wanted to make sure to find a way to mount it securely that would not require me to take my case off to do so. This mount fit the bill.Some things I couldn't tell from the product description: The holder can expand slightly because it is made of two pieces held together by a spring mechanism. Also, the product comes with 8 different pieces for the top and bottom: 4 as pictured in the product description, and 4 that extend out from the holder. So, the holder can be customized very easily to hold practically any sized smartphone, and to do so snugly.Also, the holder portion is very adjustable. It can rotate 360 degrees around and can tilt back and forth. But, it also has a locking mechanism to make the holder fit tighter, so once you have it in the position you want, it will stay there and not make the phone wobble.I'm very pleased with my purchase.",5
"The suction mount really does not work well at all.  More often than not, it ended up on the floorboard of my car.  I do not recommend any suction cup!",1
For $10 it works pretty well. Good suction and super tight fit for the iPhone 4/4s. It's great if you use your phone as a GPS Nav.,4
"This windshield/dashboard mount is quite handy.  I bought one for my daughter as well, and she complained that the clips, which slide in, kept falling out.  You have to be careful to remove the phone by pulling down, then out instead of sideways because the clips are pretty loose, and will come off.",4
I have owned 2 of these. One I keep in my Jeep and one I travel with for rental cars. Very sturdy stand with excellent suction cup. Will not shake around wile driving if properly installed. Fit my 3gs perfectly. To my Utter shock the Iphone 5 fit perfectly also.Don't lose the little clips for the side. If you lose more than 1 you are done.I am happy with this stand.,5
"I like this but trying to take the phone off is a little hard, sometimes it feels like it might break, but it hasn't yet.",3
"My wife and I will fly into a town, rent a car, then travel in a circle to see the sights and then fly out.The rental car company always wants to rent you a GPS at some off the wall price.This fixes the problem.I have a copy of CoPilot, a turn by turn GPS that costs 14.99, on my phone.I place this device on the windshield, put my phone in it, use a usb cable to power it and we are on our way.I have put 5,000 miles on this an it has worked perfectly.I have used it with three dirrerent size phones and it is great.",5
"The Arkon iPM515 Windshield/Dashboard Mount functions very well, holding your smartphone up your car.Pros:The suction cup is non-sticky, but comes with a clamp for easy and secure suction and release from the windshield. Once it is on, it feels very secure to the point where it is debateable whether an auto accident would even dislodge it. Fortunately when releasing the clamp, it comes off with ease. It does leave a non-permanent mark where it has been on the windshield which is expected for suction of this caliber.Cons:The size of the phone has it's limitations in this plastic contraption. Although the description said it was for the iPhone 4/ 4S, I bought it for my iPhone 5. While it does fit without a phone case, it's tight. I won't deduct much from the rating for this since the description did state it was for the a specific model, however it is disappointing it isn't more size universal. One grip I have that is legitimate is the thin holders on the top and bottom. They get high marks for being able to move them from side to side easily allowing access to ports and buttons as needed. However, they are flimsy and have the tendency to break if not careful with.Rating: 4 out of 5Recommended: Yes, but make sure will fit for your phone size.",4
At first glance item looked nice and have bought products from Arkon before.  After only a month of use the spring which secures phone in place broke making the item useless and had to throw it away.,2
it would be more helpful if the holding arms adjusted to accommodate for a phone case/cover. Besides that it does exactly what it says!,4
I purchased this mount for use of my iPhone as a GPS when traveling on business as my employer will not reimburse rental car provided GPS systems. It's simple and easy to use and has a really good grip on the device. The movable 'arms' are convenient for insuring no ports on the device are blocked while it is in-use. I have another mounting system from this same manufacturer in my personal vehicle and am also pleased with it.,5
"I would recommend this for an iPhone 4 user.  The adjustable clips are the top and bottom are nice, as is the lock for the swivel.  Great product.",5
"I published one of these some time back for around $20 and love it, the only problem I had was I broke one of the arms that holds the phone. The suction cup on it was the.sticky type and it would suction to about anything. This one has the standard (sub-standard) plastic suction cup. It will not suction and hold to anything.",1
"I bought this for my Droid Incredible. It's such a great and sturdy product for such a cheap price compared to buying it straight from Arkon. This pretty much holds any device that's long enough for it to be clamped onto.I understand that the pegs are fit to size to keep them from sliding off easily, but they're kind of too hard to move. This would be a problem if you use this for other devices, but I guess it's alright if you only use one device and keep the pegs where you want them to be.",4
it works but isnt like made of real good quality. i had to super glue it back together today but it does work and it was a good deal,3
Perfect for travel and every day use! This windshield mount is perfect all iphones and has a secure hold for mulitpurpose use. You won't be disappointed. I have also never had a problem mounting the holder nor keeping it mounted. Excellent!,5
"It holds the phone properly, but when you put it onto the windshield or stick it on the pad they give it for dashboard use, it just falls down. The suction does not work at all. I bought it but not able to use it.",2
purchased this for my husband it it works very well. never had any trouble with it. use it on the iphone 4S and works perfectly fine.,4
"Works great with my iPhone 4 with and without bumper case, however it does occasionally decide to unstick itself from my windshield.",4
Works great.  Use it every day.  Great price on a great product. Would highly recommend you are in the hunt for a good window mount.,5
Its Big enough and adjustable for any phone. The unit itself adjusts or it comes with extra tabs that are longer. it even comes with a dash adhesive if you want to mount it on your dash. 3M of course so it leaves no residue.,5
Fits my iPhone 4 even with the OtterBox Commuter Series case.OtterBox Commuter Series Hybrid Case for AT&T; and Verizon iPhone 4 (Green/White)Very light and non-bulky compared to other mounts.  The 'legs' slide onto the case in small grooves and can be adjusted so they don't cover the on/off and dock connector.  There are two extra 'legs' provided that are longer for other model phones.  The mount holds the phone securely because it's spring loaded. I use the windshield mount and the suction is so strong it works without locking it in.,5
"While the construction is not the best, it holds the phone well and can even hold my GPS. The suction cup is pretty strong and I like the adjustable spring-loaded 'fingers'. I have it mounted on the windshield, but it looks quite cool when placed on the dash as well.",4
So far this has met all my expectations. I installed the longer arms that come with it and it works great for my iPhone 4 with an otter box case and my wife's iPhone 5c. Suction is very strong and it also has a nut on the back that you can finger tighten or loosen to adjust the angle and orientation. Great product so far. I am ordering another one so my wife can keep one in her car,5
"This item did its job for a little while, but mine eventually broke from taking my phone in and out of it. Its a bit of a pain trying to put your phone in it and then taking it out again, but overall not a huge nusciance. (sp?) I don't think I would waste my money on this one again.",3
"This is by far the best holder I've ever had. I have it stuck to my dashboard using the included double sided tape plastic disc. The dash on my Nissan Altima is curved so I was worried it might not stick strongly, but it turned out just fine.Little to no vibrations occur, you can get any viewing angle you like, the phone attaches and dis-attaches super easily.. just awesome.",5
"This mount is the best and cheapest mount I have ever bought. I have tried many other mounts and different methods of holding my iPhone 4s, but none of them even come close to the wonder that is the Arkon IPM515. It is by far my favorite mount and I will never waste my money on another one ever again. It never slips off my windshield, it has adapters so you don't have to squeeze your device in every time, and the legs can readjust so it doesn't cover any ports or hold the power button. This is by far my most recommended mount I have seen.",5
"You will be happy either way.The Arms can be adjusted just right so the iPhone speaker and lower mike is not blocked. Did not have the issues with some of the reviews above.Looks very nice, not cheap, on your window.",4
I like the way you can resize it to fit my iPhone or my Garmin.Holds good to window and dash.I only use it when I use the navigation on my phone because I don't take the time to take my phone out of the case for short trips.,4
"This is a very nice mount with lots of extras making it a real bargain. I tested it by sticking it to the windshield, without any cleaning or prep, and it sticks quite well.  I put my iPhone in it, and allowed the GPS to guide me not only down the road but over some pretty rough dirt roads. The mount held the phone securely, and the ball and socket allowed me to view the phone with no problems.  The arms that hold the phone are easy to adjust, and for the iPhone I adjusted both top arms to the center and both bottom arms to the outside.  This allowed the on/off switch to be free, and left plenty of room for the charging plug. Also, works well with most cases.The unit comes with longer arms for larger phones and a plastic disc you can mount to the dash and then use that to mount the suction cup.This has been sticking well in warm and cold temps, but easy on/easy off allows me to keep it in the glove box when I don't need it.So far a great product at a great price.  Good gift for someone with a new smartphone.",5
"After reading about the Droid X holder for much more money I decided on this.It is simple, has different ends to hold different things, and can adjust to items almost twice it's size.It took me a few times to find the combination of ends which will hold my Droid X with a gel case. I recommend testing it before installing in the car as some of the connectors popped my phone right out. I was glad I was right there to catch it.After all the parts were in and the phone connected I tested out the holder by driving over a while. The phone did not jiggle or slip.I am glad I purchased this. If you have a Droid X consider trying this. It will not pop up the car interface like the Motorola one, but it is less money.Update August 2011Well, the top interferes with either the jack or power button of the Droid X, blocking the use.  I had to upgrade to get one that did not, but this is still a nice unit.",3
I rated it like i did because its great. Holds your phone in a case even. None of the others on the market do that. But its wonderful and I completely am glad I bought it. A friend had it and showed it to me and I was like gotta get one. And so I did. Definitely sticks well on the window too.,5
"Couldn't get the round plastic piece to stick for some reason, but the holder stays on the windshield pretty good except when it's really cold out.",3
Not a big fan of this thing. Does not have enough pressure to hold the phone if you travel over any rough roads or cross rail road tracks the phone will bounce out and onto the car floor.Save you cake on this one.,2
"it comes with a ventose plug, and with a sticker pad to change it if you'd like it permanent on the windshield. it's nice, it's cheap and it works.please handle it with care, because the grabing parts are delicated, and maybe they can break with exteme preasure.i recomend this item",5
"The product offers two mounting options: dash or windshield. The suction cup really holds. The phone fits a broad range of sizes -- it comes with different length legs (the tabs above). The mount holds the phone securely. (I have an iPhone 4.) It uses a spring-loaded mechanism. I liked it so much I bought two as gifts. I recommend it wholeheartedly.BTW: I'm looking for feedback on my reviews. Leave a comment or mark the review as useful if you think so. I aspire to write factual, brief, relevant reviews. Thanks!",5
"Great product , great protection",5
"I bought this as a gift because the person receiving it wanted a slim case for their new iphone 5. This one did just that and even had some felt in the back to prevent the aluminum on the back of the phone from being scratched. It came on and off easily so that was nice. However, the individual did drop the phone and the case didn't help the corner impact much. There are some parks on the case and the phone. The individual recently switched to a bulkier and more durable case. This case is great at preventing scratches, but for drops there much better ones out there.",4
I got this case for my wife - fits the iPhone 5s just perfectly and offers good protection. Definitely worth considering.,4
"Such a great case. I often times find myself running into a problem when it comes to charging with certain cases where the charger will no longer fit so you have to remove the bottom of the case in order to access the plug, not the case here. This case is great, the colors are exactly how they arrived in my mailbox and I have zero complaints.",5
Pretty and functional.  Not so stylish but for the price I like the looks and protection. Recommended if you like minimalist design.,4
"I love the color of this case (Coral)! Other than that, i do not like the material it is made from. It gets dirty easily. also, the bottom slides off the phone frequently.",3
"Great case, fits phone perfectly (Verizon IPhone)  not as slippery as other plastic cases does not obstruct any part of the phone. I like this one so much I will be ordering it in another color!",5
"My wife saw this at a friends house and she wanted the exact same one.  Our friend told us that she got it from Amazon.  We found it and ordered it.  It came within the shipping days that it said it would come.  My wife loves, it,  She says it works and feel great for her iphone 4.",5
"I bought this blue case about 2 months ago when I first got my iPhone. It was a pain in the butt getting it on but it looks fantastic! The blue really looks great with the white iPhone. For the longest time I could not get the case off until I took a knife to it and was finally able to stick the knife in between the case and the phone. The bottom piece is really easy to slide off, it's the top that can be difficult. Now that I took it off once, it comes off easier each time. It's a really sleek case and it looks sharp. I already ordered another color from casecrown. I would highly recommend you buy from casecrown if you need an iPhone cover!",5
This is a great and very protective case.  The color is beautiful.  I like the velvet lining-prevents scratches.  I have bought several of these over the years and keep coming back to them.,5
"Ive bought and used a lot of iphone 4/4s cases and I must say that the CaseCrown Lux Glider is one of my favorites, it hits on a lot of the criteria that I look for in a case. First off the price was excellent, I paid just over 10 dollars for this case and it was on my doorstep within 3 days. I also had no problem with this case bubbling up my screen protector, making for a very protective one/two punch. Ive dropped this phone a few times and my phone is still looking good thanks to the case. There was no flash issue with the camera cut out and another nice thing is that the cutout wasn't huge like some of the other companies have been doing with there cases. Overall the glider case has a look and feel of a case that's double its price and makes it easy for me to recommend this to anyone looking for a new Iphone 4/4s case.",5
"I really love this case compared to the others I've had.  It's not bulky, it looks great, it stays in place, it protects the phone shell, does not take away from the screen size (compared to say Otterbox which protects the screen great but takes away quite a bit of screen size real estate) The color is awesome, its a metallic magenta and stays clean, easy to clean if you get dirt on it.  Sometimes I get lotion spots from holding it in my hand and it cleans easily.",5
I think the best thing about this case is the color (coral surf).  The top and bottom fit together but don't snap or anything.  There's nothing really holding the two pieces together so the top tends to slide off frequently when taking it out of my pockets or something.  If it weren't for the color i'd give it one star. I  REALLY love this color.,3
"almost of two months of owning this case i can say i am very disappointed. loved the color. it has finger prints or water marks on the back of the case. looks dirty and have to rub it clean. it claims to wont scratch phone but it does. and it doesn't fully seal into a close with the two parts. there's a gap. secondly, its so hard to remove. i was almost going to break my phone trying to remove case. this case will not protect your phone from falls if it drops facing down. never using it again.",1

"If you are like me, I was looking for a slim, yet protective case for my iPhone 4S.  I originally purchased this case because of all the rave reviews on the Case Crown Sapphire Blue Case.  After receiving the case quickly and putting it on my phone I was quickly disappointed that the edges of the case were flush with the front of the screen meaning that there was no bumper to protect the front screen.  I was looking for a case with a slight bumper so if I were to lay my phone face down it would be protected.  I just purchased the Belkin Essential Case for iPhone 4 and 4S (Pink / Purple) which is similar to the speck cases that offer a front bumper.",3
Bought this for the wife's iPhone 4s and she and I both like it very well.  We had a Speck brand before this until it wore out and this one is very comparable.  The bottom can be slid off easily if the phone will not sit in a docking station right or in our case using a 3rd party wall charger that has a wider connector.,5
"Based on the listing, i was expecting this to be a bright, candy apple red color.  In fact, it is much darker than shown online.  This was the first problem that I had with the case.  Then, just a couple of months after I got the case, I started to notice that the color was cracking off the case.  CHEAP!  Wow.  Things just are not made to last these days.  I certainly did not abuse the case whatsoever.  I would not recommend this case to anybody, except people I don't like.",1
"I am someone that reads review after review and buys/returns a case if its not just so. To make a point, I could just about open my own tech accessory store front I have so many unused laying around.This case: awesome! It fits perfectly. It feels great in the hand (doesn't rub your pinky the wrong way when you hold it in portrait). It adds next to no bulk. IT PROTECTS!The ONLY gripe I have is if you buy another color, it has the tendency to get a little dirty. I bought the black and I saw no such thing but I bought the coral for my girlfriend (she loved the color) but it did get discolored after some use.",5
"I like the color, its easy to install. very slim profile but it pick smudges and coloring from your clothing",3
"The glider just doesn't work for me because the screen protector gets messed up.  It's nicely made and I like CaseCrown, but prefer the snap on.  I also don't like much coverage on the bottom because of the adapter.  The CrownCase snap on is the one I like - no coverage on the bottom and snaps on.  If the screen protector and coverage isn't a problem, try it.",4
"If you are looking for all around protection (including 'lay on the table' design) then this is the case to get.  It is the perfect blend of size and strength.  It's not as thick as the Incase Slider, but you get identical coverage.  Further, the CaseCrown case has MUCH better connecting pieces than the Incase Slider also.  The seam is almost invisible in the black color.  It's a tight fight and yet it doesn't interfere with your screen protector (can't use screen protector on Incase Slider).  This is the best slider/glider case on the market right now.ONLY gripe is that I wish the CaseCrown logo on the back wasn't so large and prominent.Forgot to mention that the cutout for the lightning port on the bottom is big enough to fit 3rd party plugs.  I tested the 30pin to 8pin lightning adapter as well as a micro usb to 8pin lightning adapter both from DX.com and they both work great.",5
"I really like this cover.I'm very wishy-washy with cases, and I constantly buy new ones because there are so many that I just don't care for, but this one is really great.",5
"I love this case.  It is exactly what I expected as it is the same one I have on my 4S.  I have read a lot of criticism of poor fit and not the same as the 4S case.  I don't know why these comments have been made, but at least for my case, they are not true.The case fits perfectly and was very easy to put on and lock in place.  It has the same non-skid finish of the 4S case; it has the same felt protection inside as the 4S case; it has the same beveled edges as the 4S case; it has the same good access to the openings as the 4S case.Don't hesitate to get this case; I have no idea what the complainers are smoking, but I am extremely pleased with the features and the price!!!Highly recommend.",5
No really I have 4 daughters so pink was the obvious choice if I wanted to make everyone happy. The case is sturdy and I am all man.,5
"I like the soft touch to these cases, just it's hard to get off cause it's so snug fitting on the iphone",4
i liked that it covers most of the front of the phone and slides together. it is a tight fit on the phones and can be hard to get off. i like the quality of the case as well as how it looks.,4
the case cracked after a couple of days made out of cheap material had a bad experience didnt think it would break that fast,1
I had a case crown on my old 4...got that one for 7 got this one for iphone 5 for 8...longer so an extra dollar i understand..i love it...protects phone and have great colors...clips on like a glove and easy to take off...buy multiple colors and your set for different wardrobe.,5
"So being a girl I needed a pink case and decided to buy this one since I previously had a CaseCrown glider case for my iPhone 4 and loved it. I love this one even more than my previous one! The pink looks a little different in person but it is still very cute :). The case fits perfectly on my phone. Not loose, not really tight, just perfectly snug. I love how the case is not too bulky but I know it will protect my phone if I drop it. I have had this case on my phone for like a week or two and have had no problems with it!",5
"this case was perfect, i hate when they are bulky i like to have a slim case. Good for the price too",5
this case is good good case if your not one for carrying a a brick in your pocket. its is somewhat sturdy il will give your phone some protection because of the lip around the screen.,4
"got this for my wife, she likes it.  little more bulky than some cases, but good protection.  You can also access all the buttons nicely.",5
"I've been buying these exact model cases since the iPhone 4 came out and they do their job. I've dropped my iPhone from a decent height straight onto concrete on a few occasions by accident and my wife has done the same with hers. The case takes the hit and leaves the phone unscathed.This is probably the 4th or 5th one of these cases I've bought in the last few years since after a handful of hard hits like that, they tend to have points where the impacts happened that show some wear and damage and feel like if it took one more solid hit in that same spot it might not protect as well.But for $10ish a pop, its well worth the money when it comes time to replace.This specific model/color and the black one I bought for mine are my preferred style also since they have a sort of soft touch rubbery texture that adds just enough friction when it's in your shirt pocket or wherever and keeps it from rocketing out and hitting the ground. I've had the non-rubbery textured versions of these before and while they look nice, don't add much bulk and protect the device, they tend to be a bit slick.",4
"This is one of the best iPhone cases I have ever bought, it keeps your iPhone very protected as it covers all corners and sides of the phone and it looks very good. I read the reviews before purchasing it but it really has turned out to be better than expected in both looks and quality. Very recommended.",5
"This case is exactly what I was looking for. The color is gorgeous, a bright coral perfect for summer and looks great against my white iPhone. I get so many compliments on it. It fits the phone PERFECT, and super easy to put on. I've dropped it a few times and the case hasn't come off and my phone is fine. The thing I love about this phone is the texture, its almost velvet-like and super soft, and on the inside has padding so your phone doesn't get damaged. This is a steal!",5
"There's something that really annoys me about this cover.  The auxiliary jack doesn't fit though the hole in this case.  Other than than, it would've been nice.  It looks better than the Otterbox that I had on my iPhone 5 (the Otterbox made my IPhone look big).",2
"I really like this case. Here's a rundown of my experience so far.* Color: The color is pictured accurately, and it is gorgeous.* Fit: The case fits the iPhone perfectly. Some other reviewers are saying it's difficult to put on, but I have not found it so. It's just very snug, as it should be. It preserves the slim profile of the iPhone very well.* Durability: I got the case very recently, but I have already dropped the phone a bajillion times (thus the need for a case). So far, it has protected my phone well and the case doesn't show any scratches, chips, or any other damage. I'm very surprised by how strong this thing is.* Camera flash: I was worried that the case would interfere with the flash on my camera and give everything a purple glow (I've had this problem with other cases), but the flash comes out clean.* Port accessibility (this is where the minor problem comes in): All ports are accessible, with the occasional exception of the audio jack. The little space for the audio jack is a little small for some plugs. It works fine for the auxiliary cable in my car and all my headphones/earbuds, but I have difficulty plugging in the speakers in my apartment. So it might occasionally be too small for some audio plugs. Not a huge deal, but worth noting if that will bug you.",4
"Love this case, its a bright coral color which is my favorite. Ive had it on for a few months now, its very sturdy hasnt cracked or scratched up it holds up very well.",5
"This was dropped once by my daughter and the case is made of metal; and it dented; causing a sharp, sharp part on the case! Total junk, in my opinion. So don't drop it on a tile floor; which isn't that 'hard'; it dented just with that kinda' small drop...she had to throw it away or risk cutting her finger. I got her the AGF Vandalay docking case; much better quality...the only thing good about this case was the COLOR! Do not recommend!",1
"For the price it's good, but not great.  I cannot get it to snap together totally tight.  But since I am too cheap to pay a lot for a case, it will do for now.",3
"A bomb could go off and this iphone cover would still be on my phone and intact.  It fits like a glove, and is sturdy enough to provide the support that a clumsy mom with a toddler needs.  I bought a much thinner one for my husbands iphone, and while his is a little sleeker and adds less weight to the phone, it is so much more important to me to have the extra protection.  And it's still way sleeker and lighter than some of the other (and probably older) iphone covers that to me are really ugly and bulky.  This adds maximum cuteness and protection with minimum bulk.  I know I'm repeating myself but I need to get the point across because there are so many cell phone covers out there and I did a lot of research and I think mine is the best =)",5
"Looks good, feels good, fits good.  Overall good design and workmanship, and fits perfectly with my 5 and my 5S.",5
"I took a risk when buying this case with both he color and the matte option. My other phone cases are a glossy plastic that handle wear very well. However, with this case not being a glossy plastic you can expect it to get dirtier and scuff up faster. This case looks awesome against my black iPhone and the bright yellow color is great. I also love how the camera cutout has a little bit of a flair to it. There's a soft fabric material on the inside that protects the back of your phone so that's nice. It comes in two parts, and those parts don't stay together unless they're on the phone but that shouldn't be a problem as long as you do you best to keep them close when the case isn't on your phone.",4
"Please, please, please do not accept the Amazon dipiction of the color of this cover as accurate.  It is a deep, gorgous royal blue.  Actually it is so dark that I wound up giving it to my husband for his Iphone 4, and he is thrilled with it.  Unfortunately I found that putting on and taking off the cover was such a hassle that it wasn't worth the work.  I've owned several Otterbox Defenders and although I am aware that they are a different configuration, nothing should be this hard to apply. I'm gonna keep looking till I find my nirvana, but this is a good step along the way if you don't mind a very, very snug fit for your Iphone.",3
Very happy with my purchase.  It was exactly what I have been looking for.  I needed a slider for my 5.  Had one for my 4 and it comes in handy.  Received as promised in a timely manner.,5
"Its a solid case, not going to be cracking on you with a nice velvet lining. Fits very snug. Pretty good protection for a low profile case.  I also like the polycarbonate material.  Doesn't seem to scratch or show fingerprints.  The amethyst is a little darker and richer than the picture, which tends to make it look pink.  Its not pink.  Its a pretty deep pinkish-reddish purple.  Very attractive on both color phones.  My friend has it on her white phone and it looks great on that one, too.  Casecrown sells their cases for 30-40 bucks on their website, so this is a great value.",5
"This is bit more raspberry red, than a true red, however my husband loves it, it fits the IPhone 4S really nice, no impediment in using the controls at all, a little slippery, but he as not dropped it, but it makes the phone look very sharp!",5
"This case is fantastic. Seriously. I've used a case by both Splash and MiniSuit and this one is by far the best, not only because of functionality but also because of the physical look and quality. The fit is perfect and solid. It's a 2-piece and fits more snugly than the other cases I've used, and it protects the sides and back very well. I dropped my phone on rocks once; the phone was protected and there are barely any indentations in the case. All the access ports are perfectly aligned. I love the color. I plan on sticking with CaseCrown for my iPhone 4!",5
"I ordered this case for my newly-bought iPhone 5s. (The cases that were being sold directly from the Apple Store were incredibly over-priced. Who would pay $30 or more for a flimsy case?)Right from opening it's package, I could tell it was very well made and would last a long time. The material is a hard plastic-like material, and it poses great protection in case if you drop it.The bottom of the case comes off so you can take your phone out easily (but not too easily, so you don't have to worry about it falling off unexpectedly), and the cut-out of material around the charging port and camera work very well. This case doesn't cause any pictures you take to be disrupted by the flash of your camera like some other cases I've owned. It's also very easy to get the phone IN the case, if I haven't mentioned that before-hand.I definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for a better (and a heck of a lot cheaper) alternative to the over-priced cases in retail stores!",5
LOVE this case. Love the color love the protection. Everything about this case is great. I have dropped my phone a bunch of times and nothing has happened to it. Only thing when it gets dropped it gets a bit scratched up on the corners. but thats to be expected. Had this product for months now!,5
"i love this case.  The color is really cute, stands out and doesn't leave finger prints on the case. I highly recommend it.",5
"The case is slim and sleek.  It gives the iPhone great protection without making it too bulky.  The color is what made me buy it because I wanted something simple, but also eye catching without having weird prints.",5
"I hate bulky phones so otter cases are out for me. This probably isn't the best case if you are clumsy and drop your phone a lot. In my case, it works well. I like the velvety lining to ensure that your phone doesn't be scratched.",5
This looks like a nice case. Bought this because I think everybody should have a Red case for their I-Phone.,4
I love this case.  It's very sleek and sophisticated.  Nice case in a variety of colors.  I will be purchasing more.,5
"I like that it covers the whole outside and has a ridge to protect the screen from being placed screen down. Also the case feels good in the hand and is relatively slim. The only thing it is more red in person than it is in the picture, more like strawberry than maroon. Other than that I love it.",5
"Very nice looking cover.  It is sturdy, it doesn't look and feel cheap.  I would have one request and that would be to not have the manufactures name on the bottom of the case, but otherwise it looks great.",5
"I am going to copy and paste what someone wrote on the same case in black because this is my EXACT disappointment.  'I was a big fan of the 3GS CaseCrown case and recommended it many of people. My expectations were high for this one, especially since CaseCrown released their iPhone 4 case months after other vendors. The case is nice, but it seems like the front of the case offers almost no protection to the screen as it is almost flush with the screen.'I feel like putting my cheapy eBay case back on because there is no front coverage. I waited 3 months for this case as I had the 3GS one. Also, my previous case was in 'pink diamond' color which is not offered in the slider case.Overall disappointed.  I would like more coverage in the front and I would like the pink diamond color.  I fear my expensive anti-glare HD screen cover will start coming off. :(UPDATE 11/12/10Even more disappointed. The case is now attracting dirt, fuzz, crumbs, etc... wherever I set it down. It's like a magnet.  It's like whatever coating was on the back to repel is gone and now attracts everything. I'm taking the case off and going back to my cheapy until I can find a better case.",1
"Got this case for my iphone, and glad I did. This case had protected my phone when I dropped it from a ladder, its been smashed, thrown, dropped, and beaten but still looks great, and my phone is still well protected. I would buy another case without hesitation.",5
"Wife loves the color, texture, and fit of this case. She has a white Sprint iPhone 4s. This color really looks good with the white iPhone 4s.",5
"These cases are smooth in texture, attractive in color, and, most importantly, very protective. Plus, they don't add much bulk to the phone, and do not obstruct the screen at all. I had one of these cases on my phone while I was visiting a museum (with stone tile floors). I somehow missed my pocket and the phone fell on the floor from waist high. The case itself was nicked, but the phone was fine. I've dropped my phone since, and my case always takes the hit for my phone. I love this case.I wish CaseCrown would make this series in more colors! (I would probably buy them all!)",5
"This is a great case.  I really like the slim profile.  It doesn't bulk up the phone but provides enough protection that I'm not too concerned about dropping it. I don't have any trouble getting the case off, like some have.  I was expecting to hear a click or feel a positive connection when I slid the lower section on, but it is snug enough that that's all it needs.  The texture is good for gripping, like a very low nap velvet, which I hope doesn't wear off too soon.  The fit and finish is very good, but an ultra fussy person might find fault with the seams or whatever.  At $12, this was a great deal to me.  I just can't justify spending $30+ on what is essentially molded plastic.  There are cheaper ones, but they often don't protect all the edges.  This was the right product at the right price.",5
"Bought this for my wife over a year ago.  Was just looking at it the other day, and I was amazed at how well it has held up.  It is still in great condition, and protects the phone well.",5
"Fit perfectly on the iPhone 4, and it works great.  It's exactly the same as the InCase models I had bought previously, but less expensive.  Buy with confidence.",5
Case crown makes awesome cases and this one is pretty cool I don't like that it is slippery and it pulls the screen protector off when you install it. If that doesn't bother you then this is the case to get.,5
"I am very pleased with the case that I got.  I have had CaseCrown cases for my iPhone3GS and 3G phones and was always happy with the color and the fit.  This one was no exception.  The case fits perfect and looks great.  Not to mention it got here 2 days early.  Yes, I could have gotten a free case direct from Apple but I didn't want to wait for up to 3 weeks, ane I could get them in any color I wanted (as long as that color was black).  All in all I would definately recomend this purchase.",5
"Thin profile. Snug fit. I bought it for a few people at my company. I have used the CaseCrown for my iPhone 4S and loved it. Looks clean. Will catch pocket lint over time but the problem is the lint in your pocket, not the product.I used this in conjunction with a Skinomi cover. DON'T DO IT! I failed with that. I would be careful if putting a screen protector as well. It slides onto the edges of the case and may snag your protective screen.",5
"Looks great on my phone! It's a nice and slim, so it fits in my pocket better than a bulky Otter Box. Also, it does provides my phone with the protection it needs.",5
"I scratched my brand new iPhone trying to force this case on. It was hard to take it off, too.If you're picky when it comes down to fitment, look elsewhere.",1
This is my first cover for my new iPhone and its really cool looking. I think its metal with a silicone outside. The color is bright and really cool to look at. The inside has a little bit of felt so it doesn't scratch your phone. I did have a little trouble first  putting it on the phone. I  didn't slide it in correctly as there is a slight  lip that the cover clips onto the iphone with. Once I figured that out it worked fine. There are two pieces but they lock securely into place and don't fall apart.Update 10-29-11I keep my phone in my pocket and the color has worn off and has started chipping which is strange because I only keep my phone  in my pocket nothing else. It was a nice blue color but didn't last long only 8 months. The case itself is still fine just the color faded.,4
"I had this case for the 4s and the 5s case is pretty good as well. Makes the phone very understated, like a cool black brick. If you put a non-glare (matte) screen protector on the phone, it will look very good.",5
"This case is extremely well designed, the color is excellent, and it provides excellent grip.  This model has been designed to never interfere with a screen protector.  There is no interference with the front glass at all.  Perfect case.",5
"I am very happy with this case except 2 things- It didn't come with a screen protector, and none of my 3.5mm plugs fit in the headset jack. The tolerances are just a bit to close there. The apple headphones fit, but not the plugs I use in my car or home stereo.",3
It fits great and protects the phone well without adding a lot of bulk. I love the soft/satin finish and the fact that the bottom is removable so the phone can still be docked.,5
"I had ordered the coral colored case thinking it would be the same color as the one shown in the picture, but the one I received was definitely a lot more of a fluorescent pink. But I got this case halfway through spring and honestly, the color is amazing for this time of year. So all in all I'm satisfied with the product, the color took a little getting used to, but I've gotten a lot of compliments, so I definitely can't complain.",5
"PRO: It fits perfectly. Zero looseness. I used to hate to put case on my iPhone, but I dropped a couple of weeks ago and the front screen cracked. So ...The only CON I could think of is that since it is a two piece design, the case should not be taken off and put it back on now and then to clean up. Overall, I would rate this 5 stars and recommend the product.",5
"Works well, I do think it protects my iphone. It is a rather bright pink and has a metallic kind of sheen to it, it kinda looks orange in certain angles. It does add a bit of bulk to my iphone but is still a nice case. It fits pretty snugly and there is a nice velvet kind of lining. Nice case, especially for what I paid for it. Plus, since it is so bright it makes it harder to lose my phone.",4
"It works.  Simple as that.  Its color is spot on to what the picture is.  Blue case that works just fine.FYI these wear out over time and the bottom tends to fall off when taking out of a pocket, so plan to repurchase in the future (Mine lasted 18 months).J",5
It's snug and low profile.  It has a nice finish.  I actually bought another case just in case but didn't need it because this one is just right.,5
"got the case 2 weeks ago. was concerned because a few reviews reported how difficult it was to get the case on the phone but i found that on the 4S, the case slipped on pretty smoothly, and stays on. nice bright magenta-ish color, allows for good grip. has a nice protective border onto the front of the phone. highly recommend!",5
This fits my 4s like a glove.  The color is beautiful and the texture is really easy to hold and doesn't scratch easily.  LOVE IT!!,5
"The case is really slick (little grip to it), I stopped using it because my phone slipped out of my hand twice (short distance onto carpet, thankfully).  The sides of the case on the inside, as well as the rounded edge that comes over the front edge of the phone, have absolutely no soft material or protection to them.  I'm concerned that sliding the case on and off the phone will result in the harsh edges of the case scratching the phone.  The inside has a thin felt liner to it to help protect the back of the phone.  Not sure how much protection this gives in case of an impact, and hope I never find out.  If you like slippery cases that may slightly scratch the edges of your phone, go for it.  I was hoping for better as I wanted a case that I can easily use with docking stations.",3
"The one I ordered is the grey colored case.  Although the price is exceptional at $2.99, I wouldn't have ordered it if I had hands-on experience with it.  It's not a bad case, minds you, but it's something I would not use and it would just be another unused case in my trophy case.Pros:1. Tight and accurate fit throughout.  (Someone complained about unnecessary gap and posted pictures.  It seems CC has fixed the problem with this newer stock that I received.)2. Felt layer inside. (Only on the back, not on the sides.)3. PriceCons:1. Tight fit.  It's now very difficult to remove from the phone.  You need to be very patient and careful when removing the case.2. Cut holes are SLIGHTLY rough.  It just feels like a plastic toy.  I shouldn't expect much else for $2.99 though.I uploaded a photo about the updated fit.",3
"I bought this product because of its discounted coupon. It is worth it. I can't imagine I got the quality product with only 3$. It is slide to fit the iphone perfectly. There is some kind of texture at back of cover, I don't know how to describe that texture. But I can say that the case does not feel like smooth glossy plastic. The item feel like made of carbon fiber plastic which does not look fragile.Will recommend this to my friends.",5
"This product is great for two apple products at same time, It worked good as it was described. I would recomend this product.",5
This was very useful. I have an iPad and iPhone. So this was good for charging them both at the same time .,3
This product is fair it doesn't charge all items you have to be careful which plug you use you check your device after  plugged all night to find out no charge,3
This did not charge one device let alone 2 at one time. Biggest joke of a product. If it's not a true Apple product forget it!,1
"I was excited for this product -- one USB cable, charge two devices -- who doesn't like efficiency?  But unfortunately it doesn't work that well...first, it doesn't charge iPads, which was the main reason I bought it; second, it doesn't connect that well to my iPod -- it can take several attempts or I have to take it out of its case.  Not worth the money.",2
"My wife and I both have 1Phones and iPads. Rather than carry multiple cords around we use these splitters. One in the car charges both my iPhone and iPad when on the road. On extended trips, one cord is enough for us to manage charging all of our devices.I have used these cords with thei.Sound Portable Power Max with 16,000 mAh for iPod, iPad, iPad2, iPhone, Droid, and Blackberry. I have also used them withUltra Compact High Output Dual USB Car Charger - 2.1A Output Ideal for Charging iPad, iPad 2, Galaxy, iPhone, HTC, Droid, GPS, and Other Tablets, Smart Phones and USB Powered Devices. In both cases, this Dual charging cord will continue to work, even when charging two iPads simultaneously.By the way, I recommend both of the aforementioned charging solutions. They are better than most of the alternatives that I have tried.",5
"I thought the concept was fabulous - now we could charge both of our phones at the same time instead of jockeying for the famed 'beat you to the charger last night' discussion at breakfast.However, the fun only lasted a couple of weeks before neither phone would get a charge from this cable -- even using my 10V Apple iPad charger (since the iPhone uses 5V -- if you split off the iPhone charger, you're not getting a full charge in the same duration -- and likely to short something out IMHO)so... what did I expect for $6?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; update 6/21/2011 >>>>>>>>>>>>I will add that the seller was sad to see a negative review and promptly offered a refund or replacement.  I've requested the replacement in hopes that the product can work as advertised.  For those folks using the normal iPhone charger -- of course, it is going to overheat... you need to use a USB plug rated for 10V to be safe.  That doesn't mean the product will necessarily work, but electrically speaking -- give it a chance.",2
"Cheaply made and stopped working after a couple weeks. Plus the two ports don't both work all the time. One is for data and one is for charging, when it works correctly. Try something else.",1
"This is a good solution for charging multiple devices in the car and minimizes amount of wires hanging around.  You do need to be careful because the ends are a bit sensetive (first one broke after a while), but overall great product for the price.",3
'Charging not supported on this device' when I plug in my iPhone 4...and the reason for purchasing this product is?Did support my iPad but thats it!Garbage! Save your $,1
"Plugs into an iPhone and holds tight.For some reason, the cable is loose when plugged into an iPad.  We have 2 cables, both appear to be the same.An original iPhone cable does not have this problem with the iPad.  It's a great idea.  It helps to maintain order in your charging station.",3
"I bought this so the wife and I could simultaneously charge or phones.  This worked great, except it seems that one phone charges faster than the other.  Since we use it over night, that is not generally a problem.",4
I had to send back didn't charge my iphone 5,2
"I ignored the bad review and gave a try on this cable.The first time I connected my both iphones it worked perfectly. The cable is thicker than the traditional cable you buy from apple. My first impression based on that is that the cable is good quality.I have this cable for about 2 weeks and it's rare for me to use and I never twisted or rolled, I just let it sit on the table. In the third time I connected my iphone 4S to the sync cable it just didn't work the sync interface wasn't charging neither synchronizing (my mac wouldn't recognize the iphone device)Only the charging cable is working. So what is the deal on having this cable if only one is working and even that is only for charging?Live and learn, if something seems sturdy it doesn't mean that it's a good quality.",1
I was not able to charge more than one device at a time with this cable. It will communicate with one device and the other connector is the charge connector.,3
The charger and connector are both great. One charges the iPod and one charges and sends information. The best part is that it splits from a single USB so it doesn't tie up your USB ports with so many cables and the lenght is awesome. You can sit back while your iPad and iPhone are charging at the same time and work on both with the length as a benefit.,4
Don't waste the time or money. Use a duel charger instead with two separate cables. It's not as practical as you think.,2
"I actually got 2 of these, it charges my iPhone 4S and iPad 2 at the same time. I also gave one as a gift..",5
"I don't ask much from this, but it does everything I want.  I use it when I travel, maybe 8-10 trips a year.  So far so good.  I use it to charge a Pair of iphone4S at night and a pair of iPod touches as needed.  Never a hiccup.  Haven't tried my iPad since I always have two devices to plug in.",5
"At first I loved this charger and was a nice 2-in-1 option. It was soon after I purchased it that I started getting the dreaded 'Not compatible' when I plugged in my iPad or iPod. After numerous unplugs and re-plugs you could sometimes get it to work, but it was more hassle than help.",1
looks and feels just like the original battery i got for my Tmobile G2. Its definitly worth the money for such a good battery where your have to spend $50 at the T-mobile store,5
"Just like the original.  Battery worked fine, just like the new one, held a charge all day.  I ended up buying a new phone shortly thereafter, so whomever buys my old one will get a new battery. I would buy from this seller again.",4
I got this phone for an HTC G2 and there are little notches in it that don't let the battery slide fully in place without grinding out those notches.  I removed those and had no issues so far.,3
"Got this extra battery for my G2 because I can't always be around a charger.  Works great, no complaints here!",5
this item was purchased for personal use.  item was received same day as promised as well as new as promised.  I definitely recommend this product as well as this seller.,5
"Works great, just as expected!  I Do recommend it and its a Great way to replace an old battery for sure.",4
"I bought this because of the low price. Although I expected New, it had some scuff marks at the contacts so I know it was in a phone previously but I don't really care because the item was a lot less than other places and works like new. That said, it should be listed as USED.Pros: works fine in by HTC G2.",3
Honestly it wouldn't hold the charge more time than my actual battery. But it is easier to carry a spare battery than the charger.,3
I just received this today and as other reviewers stated they are not new. I'm willing to deal with that as long as the power in the battery is ok but what I do not like is the fact that my battery was dented and looked like they maybe took it from an old phone and resold it. Ah well guess you get what you pay for.,3
"This battery is is great especially for the price you cant beat it, received before espected will definetelly be buying when in nedd again. Thanks!",5
"My phone was shutting down as soon as I was using it. The battery level went from 100% full charge to no charge at all. I decided to change the battery. I choose the HTC ones. And it works like a charm. It keep the charge, no issue whatsoever. I'm glad I did that purchase.",5
"I bought this for an HTC G2, which (I thought) was the same as the HTC Vision. I guess it's not, as the battery seems to be just a tad too big for the phone. Still works though, so it's not that big of a deal. Just a cosmetic thing.",3
Bought this as an additional spare battery as I talk a long time and a lot with my family. Great handy spare to have with you to quickly swap it with the dead one. I don't own either the phone nor the spare battery anymore as I've upgraded over 6 months ago.,3
I got this in a timely fashion and seems to be worth the cost at this time. I would recommend it if you are needing a battery it all seems to have been a first rate transaction.,4
"Great stuff at a good price.  Allows me to set my BlackBerry near the bed and use as a clock and alarm clock.  I have moved onto an iPhone, but those of you that still use BlackBerries will appreciate this charger.",5
"Love this charging pod for my Blackberry Torch. It's actually easier to use than the charging cable. The phone slips in easily and stays in place. The clock face appears and you're all done for the night. You can use the menu buttons to access Pandora or Slacker Radio etc if you want or eyeball your email while the phone is still in the pod. Just plug your traditional charging cable into the wall, put the micro usb end into the back of the pod and it's ready to use. Could not be easier.",5
"I had a similar pod for my Blackberry Bold.  This one is different because a)the phone sits on its side instead of its bottom, and b)it connects through port on its side, rather than having the 'contactless' connection on the Bold.  I find the side orientation kind of nice--it looks more like a good functioning alarm clock and the numbers are a bit bigger and easier to read. Having it connect to the micro port seemed like it could be less convenient, but it slides in just fine, no problem.Pleased to have it.",5
Another wonderful accessory from BlackBerry! I use one on my nightstand and set my phone on 'Bedside Mode'. It dims the clock and makes for a wonderful bedside clock and alarm clock. It also charges my device so when I wake up I have a full battery. Highly recommend it!,5
"I like it a lot, easy to drop the phone on this thing.  Bad news is the clock stays on, so if you put beside the bed your wife may complain that the light is too bright (i just close my eyes and it is dark, but what do I know?)I have it on my desk now and my phone is charging and linked to the computer, plus I know where the phone is at all times - very good purchase for me.",5
"I enjoy using the Charging pod for my Blackberry Torch on my nightstand.  By the end of the day the battery indicator shows almost a depleted battery so it is nice to be able to plop the Torch into the pod, have it show the clock/alarm info automatically and charge the battery overnight (actually about 2 hours).  A real plus is the faintly glowing power-on indicator on the top of the pod so you know that the phone is being charged.  (Now I can do away with my clock radio!)",5
"Finally found a bluetooth headset with a boom arm microphone that I like.  Other ones I have seen are extremely large and look awkward to wear.  I prefer boom arm microphones rather than the ones that the mic is part on the unit and sits on your cheek closer to your ear.  It has been my experience that bluetooth microphones that sit back further from your mouth seem to pick up a lot of background noise and your voice does not transmit as clearly.  The etyBLU headset comes with a flexible boom arm that can be adjusted closer to your mouth to so you can be heard without background noises, and it comes with a bi-directional microphone so your voice is clearly heard.It can be worn for long periods of time without ear fatigue.  It is extremely lightweight and balances perfectly in my ear.  The earpiece sits deep into the ear and it comes with 5 different size ear tips so you have the best comfortable fit.  The volume could be better, even when I have it turned up to the maximum setting I have a hard time hearing the other person on the line sometimes.  For this reason, I like using the foam ear tip which molds completely around your ear canal.  I tell tell it is a snug fit because when I wear dangle earrings and they smack against the boom arm, it sounds like I am in a tunnel and the 'clunk' is deep in my ear (hope that makes sense).  Comes with two different sized windscreens to block out air currents if you are in a windy environment.  You do have the option to upgrade to a custom fit earmold directly from the manufacturer.  You can have a custom fit ear mold made from impressions taken of your ear canal.  They look and remind me of hearing aids.  They sell for $100 and you can order and schedule your appointment at the manufacturer's website.I prefer to just wear the headset without the ear loop, but if you rather use your headset with an over the ear loop, it comes with an attachable wire ear hook.  One really nice feature about the earhook is that you can adjust the length by sliding it up or down.  Also enclosed is two replaceable wax filters and filter removal tool.Comes a (very short) micro-USB cable to charge via computer or compatible device.  Since it is so short, it might make it a nuisance for people who only have USB slot located in back of their computer.  Instead I use my 12Vcar multi power socket outlet that comes with a USB slot to charge it.  Since I use this headset mostly with my Droid cell phone, I also use the AC wall power micro USB adapter that came with my phone to charge it was well.  It took me about 3 hours to get a full charge.  You know when it is fully charged with the LED light turns from yellow to blue.Pairing was a breeze; I was able to pair it with my Droid and Palm Pre within seconds.  You can connect up to 8 devices!  All functions are controlled by pressing the Multi-Function Button located in the front of the unit which is very easy to operate and find (silver button). States talk time is 7 hours and standby is 100 hours (little over 4 days).  I found myself recharging it only after using it every three days, which really is not very much time since I turn it off after every use.  So I have to take away a star for its battery life.  Other than the battery, this headset is the top of the line for that multi-tasker.Comes with a 2-year warranty.",4
"I don't know how common this is, but tend to prefer wired earbuds with a built-in microphone with my iPhone over a wireless Bluetooth earpiece (I endorse theV-MODA Vibe II Earbud Headset with Microphone, by the way). But I had a pretty good experience testing out this Etymotic Research headset. As other reviewers have noted, the sound quality on this is quite good, though oddly I encountered more sound problems indoors in a quiet room than when I was outside moving around. One thing I didn't get used to was the fit: the headset never felt secure in my ear as I moved about, no matter which 'ACCUFit eartip option' I tried or how I adjusted the over-ear clip. The secure fit of the wired earbuds is much more to my taste (though I don't try to engage in conversations with people in front of me while also wearing the earbuds). But the headset itself is well-balanced and even when it felt loose was never uncomfortable.On the whole this strikes me as a very good Bluetooth headset for daily use.",4
"The problem with most bluetooth headsets is very simple: they don't work. You can quibble over why they don't work: static on the connection, poor fit in the ear, or simply that neither the device user nor the person with whom they are attempting to chat with can hear each other. But the fact is that if ANYTHING interferes with the normal conversation experience, the device does not work.Just as simply, this device works. I can hear the people I am talking with and they don't even realize that I'm talking on a bluetooth. I'm not going to forget that I have the device in my ear, but the experience is close enough to talking into the receiver that the benefits of hands-free really shine.This is not a device that looks cool. In fact, it is kind of gangly. But let's face it: until you see supermodels rocking blueteeth(?) (i.e. never), they won't be cool. So instead of a device trying to look cool, better to have one that actually works.For anyone cannot afford to deal with all the issues that have plagued bluetooth devices in the past and who needs to have conversations unmarred by 'huhs' and 'whats' and finally by 'wait a minute' as you take the poorly performing device out of your ear and start the conversation over, look no further.It works well. In this problem plagued genre, that is saying something.Highly recommended.Epilogue: Tragically, I washed the device with a load of clothes. Miraculously, it seemed to still work after being dried off--however, even though I could still hear what my callee was saying, they no longer could hear me. So, don't wash your bluetooth!",5
"The etyBlu2 headset is an excellent headset, and the best of its kind that I've used.  Even walking in crowded, noisy streets in NYC, this product delivers very clear phone conversations by blocking out virtually all of the peripheral sounds, enabling me to converse effortlessly without having to constantly say, 'what'? Similarly, people I'm talking to hear me clearly and claim to hear everything I'm saying without being bothered by all the street noises. This is due to a combination of the etyBlu2's flexible, close proximity, noise-canceling, bi-directional boom microphone and to its assortment of five different size eartips to assure the user of finding the best fit to seal the ear canal and provide optimal speech clarity. In addition, to its performance benefits, the etyBlu2 enables the user to have wireless conversations for up to seven hours, and charging it is as simple as plugging into a USB port. Keep in mind, that while this product performs very well, it is expensive, retailing on Amazon for $129.",5
"I wanted a headset both to pair with my phones and my computer for VoIP use. I've used Etymotic products before, and their headset stood out as having the best mix of features, comfort and ease of use, so I gave it a try.The packaging is fairly minimal, although let me take a moment to complain about one of my pet peeves: 'human-proof' packaging - took me a good five minutes armed with sharp knives and scissors to get everything out of the box. Other than that, inside the box you find the headset itself, a collection of ear tips, a foam windscreen for the microphone and a short (6') micro-USB charging cable. There's no separate charger or AC power source - you need to plug the USB cable into a computer, powered USB hub or some other device.The various earpieces are easily changed and it seems like there's enough variety that most people will find one they're comfortable with. The unit is very light and comfortable, and can be adjusted to fit in a totally non-intrusive way.I had no troubles pairing the headset with a few PCs running Windows Vista and Windows 7, an iMac, an Android phone and an older Blackberry phone. Setup was easy and the device worked properly with everything I tried with no need for special drivers or tweaking settings anywhere. Range seemed at least the 30 feet typical with Bluetooth, and I haven't had interrupted calls or anything yet, except when the battery dies.From a sound quality point of view, I'd give the unit four stars. It absolutely does a great job filtering background noise both ways, and people tell me I come through loud and clear without having to scream or be in a quiet room. Although it's difficult to judge sound quality using standard voice calls, I have access to a high-definition audio conferencing system, and the Etymotic really stands out, head and shoulders above the previous Motorola and Plantronics units I've tried.I only have two small gripes. First, the maximum volume could be slightly louder. Even at the max setting, I'm having a hard time hearing phone calls if I'm in a noisy setting such as on a train or moving car. The second gripe has to do with battery life, which seems a bit low to me. Plus, it seems to take a fairly long time to charge - several hours from totally dead to fully charged. Other than these minor complaints, I'm happy with the unit and would recommend it to anyone wanting a top quality Bluetooth headset.",4
"I've used a Plantronics Discovery for years with no problems, but decided that after five years it was time to try a newer headset.  This Etymotic headset is very nicely designed and lightweight.  After trying it out for a week, here is my experience with it:PROS* It comes with a variety of earpieces in different sizes and materials so you can customize it to your ear.* The volume and on/off buttons are easy to locate while you are wearing it.* The audio is very clear on both ends of the call (I had a friend use it to call me so I could see how it sounds.)* The battery life seems fine.CONS* Despite which earpiece I try, it won't stay in my ear even with the included ear clip.  After a few minutes of use, or if I turn my head, it starts slipping out and I have to reinsert it.* The volume, even on high, is too low for me to hear in a noisy location.* The buttons are stiff and difficult to push.  When I use the on/off button, I have to push so hard that the unit shoves way too far into my ear.Because it is so hard to push the on/off button and because it seems to fall out of my ear after a few minutes anyway, I've started taking it out to turn it off and then I keep it out when I'm not using it.  Not very practical and it's destined to get lost if I continue using it this way.  I'm glad I didn't ditch my old Plantronics headset.I did try it with my computer as a headset for IP calls and dictation and for this purpose I love it!  Since there is no background noise I don't have a problem with the volume.  I don't use IP calling or do dictation often but when I do it's for longer periods of time so I can just wear the headset when I need it then toss it in a drawer where I won't loss it.SUMMARYThe quality of this device seems very good and it looks great.  If you have good hearing and an ear that accommodates headsets easily you will probably love it, but if you tend to have problems with headsets staying in place or have any hearing damage, you might find the Etymotic EtyBLU2 problematic.",3
"I was excited to try this headset, since the last one I bought (a Jawbone) was such a disappointment to me.  I've used this exclusively for a few days now and I feel I have a good opinion of both the good and the bad.The Good ---this was extremely easy for me to pair with my phone.  I had had the salesman do my Jawbone for me since I am unusually inept at most tech products, but the directions that came with this product were written so simply and clearly that it made it a joy for me to hook up.This product comes with a variety of ear tips so I was able to find on that fit my ear with no problems.One of the problems with the Jawbone is that the earloop was constantly breaking and I was forced to keep buying new ones, but the etyBLU's loop was constructed for real use.  Plus where the earloop connects with the body of the phone, it swivels so it can be adjusted for every type or size of ear and it aids in hooking it over the ear.The `boom mic' allows you to be confident that the person you are talking to can hear you and there is no need to raise your voice to be heard.He LED lights are easy to see so you always know the status of the product.The volume button is very easy to find and to use, although once it was se, I found I never had to change it.The sound quality was great and I never had to raise my voice to be heard.  But more importantly, I was able to hear who I was speaking to without having to constantly adjust the volume no matter where I was when using it.  Since I am a bit hard of hearing, this was especially important to me.The Bad --- While it was easy to find an ear tip that fit-the phone always seemed to feel as if it were going to fall out of my ear.  This was very annoying.I understand that devising a product this small and one that has so many functions, leaves a lot to be desired as far as what each button and light does.  For me I have to still keep the users manual with me just to know what to do when the light blinks a certain way or what to do when redialing or using call-waiting.  Perhaps if I were to use this as my primary phone I would memorize these functions faster but I only use my cell phone when I am away from the house.Most importantly to me is the fact that the Multi-Function button is made so that it is flush to the body of the main unit, and is also very `stiff`(it requires quit a bit of pressure to press). If you have longer hair, you will not be able to find it (the MFG button) without some problems.  I have long hair and I tried this phone with both my hair down and in an updo.  With my hair down it was impossible to press these buttons without it constantly falling out of my ear.",3
"I always make clear when I write a Vine review that I am reviewing this based on its price.  In this case, $129.This is the first time I've found that to be difficult.  That's a lot of money for an earpiece, but it's a great earpiece!It comes with a nice assortment of ear plugs.  Not just in size, but in material.  Foam, rubberish, siliconish (not sure about the actual composition of each).  The instructions are concise and help make clear what kind of fit is best.  My ears a very unusual, and I simply can't stand most bluetooth earpieces, but I found a fit that worked great this time.  It's very comfortable, once you adjust it to fit, even if you wear it for a couple of hours.  I even played Playstation 3 games using this to communicate with other players... it didn't detract at all from the experience (other bluetooth devices most certainly did).It also includes a filter for collecting earwax (and a spare).  This is a big problem for me (I know, embarrassing).  This is a well conceived idea that will probably save the device's life.The long boom for the mike looks ridiculous, in my opinion, but it's worth it.  My wife, with her completely different earplug, was easy hear when calling from a busy, windy, urban bus-stop and then when riding on a loud bus.  It was easier to hear than if she had been speaking directly into her phone.  We chose to use the medium sized baffle.Battery life is exceptional.  I've used it steadily for about a week until it finally died.  At least ten hours of actual talking.  I'll update this post when I know how the battery held up over a few months.  Message me if I've forgotten!The most important aspect is how well the wearer can hear calls.  In short, it's perfect.  The noise cancellation is very obvious.  With the unit off, the earplug holds somenoise back, and during a call, it's substantially quieter.  It just works.This is a five star product.  However, is it worth $130?  I've never paid anywhere near that much for such a device, but I've always been very unsatisfied with the cheaper options.  Comparing to direct competitors on Amazon, it appears this isn't out of line in its pricing, and had I paid $130, I would still be pleased with this product.The only caveat I have is that I have strange ears and have been fed up with over a dozen other models (all much cheaper).  I would suggest seeing if you are more fortunate, and can make do with one of those cheaper units before making this investment.  But with the quality and adjustability of this etyblu2, I think most people would find this to be a great way to make a phone call.",5
"It's been a long time since I've had a bluetooth headset. I was pretty impressed with this one. The fit is good, though I'm not used to a bluetooth headset going IN your ear. But, that's sound isolation technology - you don't hear stuff outside of the headset. With the provided earhook, you can be sure this won't fall out of your ear. The headset is lightweight, too. Once you get past something in your ear, the conversation will be quite enjoyable. :)etyBLU includes everything you need - eartips, earhook, windscreens and filter removal tool (ewww, earwax!). The small charging cable is short, which I liked. I have a USB hub, so this works out well for me. If you have a USB port in the back of your computer/laptop, this might not be so convenient.Pairing and using your device is easy. I was up and running in 2 minutes. The multi-use button has a lot of uses, but I just need it for turning off and on. The little blue light lets you know it's on. Orange when it's charging.My only complain is the long boom. I know it's a cosmetic thing only, but I'm used to the short and stubby bluetooth headsets. It's bad enough seeing people in public with these things on, but I wouldn't be caught dead walking around a retail store with this thing hanging from my face. I would guess that the placement of the boom allows for much better sound - both receiving and sending. I just don't like the long boom.Overall, a great headset. Good range, good sound and a solid device.",4
"I wanted a Bluetooth headset for my computer for when I use Skype.  I've used several headsets, which fit in the ear, for 'regular' land line phones without a problem.  I should say that I don't have a cellphone with Bluetooth, nor have I ever used a Bluetooth headset in the past.  I see a lot of people with them. . . and most of them look really bad/silly.Here are my 'issues' with this headset. . .First, it's not comfortable in the ear.The little metal bar that goes around your ear isn't comfortable either.  It's cheap too.  Just a piece of wire.Confusing.  .. Press this button this many times this fast to answer a call. . . hang-up. . . etc. . . They really need to make it much simpler to operate.On the 'plus' side, the battery does last a long time. . . and the sound quality is fine.  But . . for me.  .because it's just not comfortable to wear. .. I'll stick to a headset that I plug into my computer.",3
"I have known this company for quite a while now. Etymotic Research is a company that manufactures peripherals for hearing enhancement.  I work in a hospital and this company is our main supplier for this kind of specialized hearing enhancements. The made-to-order molded ear buds I use here at work is made by this company.  I was kinda surprise to see that they are now also in the market for consumer hearing peripherals much like Plantronics.First off, contents of the box:The etyBLU2 headsetAssortment of Accu-fit ear tipsWindscreensUSB cable (for charging)EarhookA Filter Removal tool to replace wax filtersSet-up was a breeze but I had to make sure I charge it first. Charging for this headset was by USB only. I have not had the chance to check if there is an accessory for AC charging which would really be very convenient. Pairing this with my phone was also a breeze. It did not take my phone a lot of time to detect and pair with this headset. The way this headset looks is also very sophisticated with the long boom and rectangular body unlike the conventional ones we so often see that is short and hangs a few inches from your ear. The ear buds were also a perfect and comfortable fit and the most important thing...it stays on your ear. Once or twice I have forgotten wearing this headset were it not for the boom when it touched my cheek.The reception was great for the most part. It is clear and static-free. The claim of noise-reduction is also true to form. I had the chance to use this while driving with the windows down with all the air resistance swooshing thru and I was able to maintain a comfortable conversation. The controls are also very convenient located. You wont guess or fumble if you would like to raise the volume for instance. The battery-life seems to be sufficient. I have had mine on stand-by for 2 full days and it still delivered crystal clear audio.My only gripe about this headset is its charging ability. The included charging device is by MicroUSB. If you are away from your PC, there is no included means to charge this via AC or car-charger. They should have at least included a car-charger in the set. But nevertheless, I am impressed overall with this Bluetooth headset's performance. Its audio-capabilities are second to none.",5
"St. George, UT, where I live, has some amazing wind and every Bluetooth device I've tried has always failed whenever the wind kicks up.  This is the first Bluetooth device I've used that worked in the wind without the person I'm calling asking me to 'take them off speaker' or anything like that.  I can even roll down the windows in my truck and still have nobody complaining about the noise as I drive around town.  The other week I hopped into a tractor and tried this out and it still worked fantastically well.  This has the best noise canceling of all the devices I have tried.I can hear the callers without any problems, as well.  Their voices come in clear as a bell, some of them sound like they are standing right next to me.As for comfort, I've been able to keep these in my ears for hours on end without it getting uncomfortable.  It can sit in my ear and I often forget it is there until I hear the beeping because of an incoming phone call.  So far it has not fallen out on its own, though I've only had this for a few weeks and other Bluetooth products seem to work fine at first and then start falling out after a few weeks of use.  So far, so good.  I'll probably add a comment later in the future on if it continues staying in my ear or not.I love this.  It is a litle bit more pricey than other Bluetooth devices I've owned but you definitely get your money's worth.",5
"Okay, there are so many bluetooth headsets on the market that it can blow your mind.  I have tried about 6 different ones and none of them work as well as this one.  My wife liked it so much that she stole it out of my car and kept it for herself telling me I should order a new one, which I did.  It is used with an iphone and believe it or not, it sounds better than using the phone both on the sending and receiving ends.  I really like this headset!",5
"When I first put this on my right ear I was disappointed, it was the first bluetooth headset I have used and everything sounded muffled. After a little while I tried it in my left ear and it sounded really good. Not double headphone good, but at least as good as the regular iPhone and the callers on the other end noticed an appreciable difference especially in the car. So I'm thrilled that this has a reversible design or else I may have unfairly rated it poorly. It charges with the newer micro USB type plug... the little D shaped plug (like on newer and android phones) not the little hat shaped one (like on many cameras and older Motorola phones). I don't have any micro USB devices, but since the charge lasts forever so it's still not a big deal that I have to use the supplied (way too short) usb cable in an adapter or a computer. The only drawback I found was that if you're hanging up and answering a lot with the button that's on the headset it can get uncomfortable since it requires a little more force that I'd like to push the button... but it really isn't that bad. But again... the sound is good to great (especially for the people on the other end) and that's what matter most, so I highly recommend it.PROS:+ Can be worn in the left or right ear+ Great background noise filtering+ Microphone is real and closer to the mouth+ Great battery life+ Multiple ear piece types for a good fit.+ Good sound+ Super easy pairing with the iPhone+ Light weight, but solid build qualityCONS:- The one touch button requires slightly too much force- People know you're wearing this with its large boom mic (also a pro)- Charging cable it too short",4
"Like someone else wrote, the hook over the ear has become very loose.  It does not hold well at all.  It actually comes out of its little hole all the time.  It is very easy to use.  You do have to get it really far down in the ear so you can hear good.  Glad there is so many different ear buds to choose from.  I finally found one that works good for me.  I didn't realize that the radio would not come thru on this, so you have to have earbuds.",4
"I generally don't like bluetooth headsets because of their inferior audio quality when compared to wired headsets. So far I've used Plantronics Voyager Pro, Jabra Icon + Journey, Jawbone (several models), Bose Bluetooth Series 2 and have been dissatisfied with all of them. I've used them with HTC Windows & Android phones, Motorola Photon, and various Blackberries. In each case, the sound quality was muted, robotic, or overly compressed (like a 16K MP3). The Bose came closest to OK but callers complained that volume was too low and highs were muted. In each case I returned to my wired ety.com or 'theBoom' wired headset.I recently switched to an iPhone 4s and ran into the echo problem with wired headsets. I thought Apple would fix the problem in the recent 5.1 update but no luck. I was forced back to using a landline for business calls which is inconvenient at best. Fortunately , bluetooth headsets don't have the echo problem with the iPhone 4s.This is the the best headset for audio quality available. Nothing else comes close. It is almost indistinguishable from a wired headset. Sometimes there is a few seconds of distortion after turning on the headset, but it quickly disappears.The package comes with the headset with boom mic, a small and large windscreen (indoor/outdoor), 5 earpieces, a cleaning tool, and a short microUSB cable for charging.The good:Fantastic audio quality. You can understand everything. Your counterpart can understand you. This is the reason you bought a headset, isn't it?Reasonably good noise rejection.Comfortable for several hours, light. Works well for small-mid sized ears. It comes with a variety of earpieces.Battery lasts long enough for a phone intensive person's day.The So So:Takes a long time to charge from PC port (3-4 hrs (?!)). You can plug it into a higher capacity charger (1 or 2 amp USB) to reduce time a bit.Multifunction button doesn't start Siri. You have to press the Siri button on the iPhone 4s. You still hear audio through the headset.Multifunction button is hard to press.If you use it in your left ear, the volume buttons are on the bottom and a little awkward to use.No apps for battery life, etc. like other headsets.The Bad:Nothing. Competing products are bad because they sound awful.No Case. The wired version (ety.com) included a case. Not sure why they left it out.In short, save up your money and buy this headset. Ignore the magazine reviews because the 'best' other headsets don't measure up as headsets. Sure, they have accelerometers and apps and look cool. But who cares? After using the etyblue2, you'll end up returning the other ones.",5
"Right out of the box, one thing is very apparent.  This is not a 'stuff it in your pocket' style of Bluetooth headset.  From the ear tips to the foam microphone covers, the design is for sound quality and not portability.  The boom style microphone and the distance the ear piece protrudes from the device confirm this assessment.  After you use it for a few days, another thing is very apparent.  The sound quality, both the voice isolation and transmission for those on the other end, and the sound in your own ear, are first rate.I am truly impressed at the noise reduction at the microphone.  I called my brother and, while holding a comfortable conversation, ground a pots worth of coffee beans with a burr grinder.  When I asked him if he heard anything, he replied 'no, nothing.'  Only then did I tell him I was grinding coffee during the conversation.  When I asked how I sounded on his end, without mentioning a new headset, he replied 'it sounds clearer than before.'  Of note, I was not using the included foam microphone boom covers.  Also, my other headsets are Jabra and Plantronics.  Just having a conversation outside with cars going by using those headsets would result in 'what did you say' all too often.Using the headset is also a breeze.  Paring the device was very quick and painless.  Charging is easy via USB.  However, USB is the only charging method included.  It took a bit of experimenting to get the right ear piece for my ear, but the included selection had a perfect match (there are 5 alternatives).  The sound isolation is better than my hundred dollar ear buds from Punch.The ear hook took a bit of getting used to.  It is so simple as to need explanation.  It is simply a metal hook for your ear that you insert into a pivoting point on the headset (the little knob on the inside of the headset).  Once inserted, it pivots and swivels.  The headset stays in without the device but once you insert it, you can rotate the ear hook over your ear for security and stability.  With my old headset, I had to slip it over my ear in a very certain fashion.  With this headset, you first insert the ear piece and then swing the hook over your ear.  Once in, it is very comfortable to wear.Finally, the controls are very easy to use for a right handed person.  There is a volume control and a master button that are both easy to find and manipulate while using the headset.  Making calls with a voice tag was a snap - a must for those driving in a hands free state like California.The down side for the headset is minimal:* It is longer than a ball point pen* It only charges via mini-USB* The boom makes it jiggle quite a bit during any physical activityIf you are looking for quality sound, both hearing and transmission, this is an outstanding headset.  Just consider the design factor and you should be a happy camper.",5
"OK well i thought i had high hopes for this one but no.1 its small and very comfortable 2 nice looking but, one very important problem it wont stay charged. i swear i used it for 20 min and it died. i charged it over night and it died,the next morning when I tried to use it. (horrible). it sounds great but it wont stay charged. i was mad because i really like this but if it dont say charged how will it work.that's what its intended for. right?",1
"First - this thing really does work impressively well. I hate it when a telephone converts me into a 'temporary amputee' (and my heartfelt sympathies for those with such disabilities). I also hate it when I have to constantly fiddle with a headset to have it either seal properly with my ear, or make 'jawbone' contact for it to work properly.SO, Im editing my initial impressions:Second - the Multi Function Button DOES need a better tactile identifier. It might also be better if relocated, perhaps to the top, to avoid 'plunging your ear' when you push it. The MFB's resistance is fairly strong.Third - I always have trouble with ear-things. I have no antetragus (the thingy above the lobe that holds flat ear buds in). So, I'm forced to use something that goes 'in the canal' --- which is great for sound isolation, but (of course) everything goes TOO far in, and is uncomfortable. I've found TWO very useful solutions, thus far:1) Take the 'long-stem' silicone piece, lop off the end 'flange,' cut down the 'stem,' and Presto! --- a custom-length two-flanged insert -- that seems to work better than standard two-flangers. As long as you make SURE the piece is secured to the main unit's stem, customizing it should be OK.2) Some earpieces from other manufacturers can do as good a job. Currently, I'm wearing an AOSafety plug, modified per above. It will NOT come off the base stem, and works great.Fourth - I'm not too impressed with the black foam. They'd be a good choice for me (for isolation, comfort, and positioning), but they 'squish down' too quickly,and they pick up too much 'stuff.' I'm going to try an after-market brand.Having used professional aviation comm gear, I found this to be the best unit of this type.I had an aviation set that clipped to the temple of my glasses (with a lightweight boom mike), and 'tubed' to a selection of earpieces. I wish I could modify it for Bluetooth! If Ety made something like that, the earloop thing would be a done deal!Finally ... Add 'Comply' ear tips. They make this a 6.UPDATE 02-04-2013:The ear loop may not allow the device to be positioned rigidly enough for some tastes. I like these things 'locked' in place, but the shaft of the ear loop did not develop enough friction with the swivel on the headset.It is easier to make the shaft larger than it is to make the hole smaller!My solution was to pour a small amount of Zap-a-Gap Medium CA+ cyanoacrylate adhesive onto a slip of aluminum foil, and apply 'Zip Kicker' (a cyanoacrylate accelerator) to the shaft. Then I dipped/rolled the shaft in the CA+. I applied a few layers,then Q-Tipped more Kicker on. I lightly filed the result with an emery board. The result was a substantial increase in the diameter of the shaft, allowing very positive positioning.WARNING! Using a Q-Tip with CA adhesive and an accelerator can and WILL release a substantial amount of heat (and some fumes)! The resulting reaction can easily be hot enough to cause burns. Putting an accelerator-soaked Q-Tip into a puddle of CA adhesive is NOT a good idea. Note also that while this 'fix' appears perfectly valid and has lasted some time, there is no way to predict what the increased stress will do to the earpiece pivot. Personally, I'd rather have this adjusted perfectly and get another one down the road, rather than have it flail about.I've looked for less expensive alternatives, and a couple have seemed --- seemed --- okay at the outset. Bottom line: I've found nothing that compares with this device for automotive use or busy-busy-hands-can't-be-bothered-holding-a-phone use.If you want EXCELLENT BlueTooth communication and VERY, VERY GOOD music quality, go with the LG 'horse collar.'",5
"I have had two bluetooth headsets in the past couple years, and hardly use them as they never stayed in my ear, or hurt after minutes of use.  My latest purchase was the Samsung WEP200, and I got it because it was the smallest, thinking it would stay in better.  No.  The earhook was useless and broke anyway.  I bought two different types of replacement ear pads, and still nothing.  it was was cool, has a nice case, and was good quality, but if I cannot keep in my ear, what's the point?Here comes the etyBLU2 and wow, they really took the time to focus on comfort.  There are many options for eartips and form fitting solutions.  There is an ear hook, which I did not have any comfort issues with, but I also do not need to use it.  That's a first.  There is also a send away option to have custom molded tips, for a significant fee, but I am getting by with the inclusions just fine.Of course, this is more than ears, it's about quality.  With easy controls and an acceptable battery time of about 7 hours of non-stop use, it's perfect for my needs in my home office.  The flexible microphone is just right, and sound quality in and out is the best.  I have used this on my iMac, netbook, voip phone and cel.  But for gamers, this is the one! Playstation 3, you know those dolts and the noise of crunching potato chips, screaming babies and nagging spouses in the background interrupting your concentration of running over street walking women for cash or trying to hear if there is a cougar or bear about to maul you, well, this takes care of the problem.  If only all the other players would have this.Only downside is that there is no protective case, but many don't.  You will find it will be on your ear most of the time anyway, and that fact that you when you think you have lost it when it's still in your ear, you will see that as  a good thing.  At this point in time, the list price is about 20-25% too high (and the optional custom fit ear mold send away offer is about 60-70% too high) , but based on the competition, you may save money due to the quality and comfort of this impressive headset.",5
"I purchased this headset a few months ago and was very pleased with both the 'receiving end' and more importantly the call quality others perceived when using this headset and the boom mic.I have tried many of the 'jawbone' style headsets and while I can hear fine, the mic is so far from my mouth (if you have a head the size of a bowling ball like me) that everyone complains that I can't be heard.  I have verified it too on voicemails I leave.  Maybe if you are a tiny little girl it is fine, but I have a drawer full of ear button headsets.However, you need to be careful with this headset as the earpiece has a tiny little stalk.  Maybe too fragile.  On mine, this broke off while in it's carrying case.  I've contacted Etymotic to see what they will do and I will update this review as a result.UPDATE 12-15-11Etymotic did a good job standing behind their product.  They send a brand new headset quickly.  Great job Etymotic!",4
"I am a tech junkie and this headset fits well within my profile.  Naturally I had to try it out to get a feel for Etymotic and my results were not in the 5 star range...while it scores VERY high on everything it lacks on sound quality in the ear.  I will begin with the pros and cons and then give you my tests:Whats included: Headset, usb to microusb cable, sponge covers for boom, extra tips for different ears, a replacement filter so when the original filter is clogged with earwax you can replace, and finally a ear hook.Pros:-Great packaging-Lightweight-Excellent battery life-Easy charging via computer or charger (micro usb now standard on all mobile devices)-Superb length for boom mic-Excellent noise cancellationCons:-No charger included (not that we don't have a dozen laying around..but would be nice to get one-only usb to micro-usb cable included)-Sound quality is very tinny - its almost too sharp for the human ear...very high pitched-Main power/pairing button too sensitive-Power LED does not come on when unit turned on - have to count on handset to see if its connectedThe devices I used to test this headset with were the Blackberry Torch and the iPhone 4.  The audio quality on both devices was similar; if there was a difference, I did not hear it.Blackberry has one of the best voice dial features and thus my first test was to see how this headset would work with voice commands while driving 65mph on a highway.  The headset worked flawlessly thereby indicating that the noise reduction feature is excellent.  The receiving party also said the audio sounded clear and there was minimal noise from the radio playing at minimal volume and or wind noise in the car at high speeds.  This is where it scored high marks.iPhone - The audio quality again was similar to that of the Blackberry and the receiving party again stated that there was minimal noise from the radio or wind noise.  Again, high marks.I did not test too thoroughly with the iPhone as my Blackberry is my primary device of choice...The reason I give it 4/5 is because I simply was not thrilled by the audio quality in my ears...it was very high pitched and made me remove the headset....  I also think that at this price point the manufacturer should include a charger..although this is not a deal breaker. The headset also ranks low due to the high price point $129 is kind of steep...but all things considered, noise cancellation does have a premium attached.Overall it is a GOOD product and deserves a 4/5 but I think it could use some mild improvements.",4
This bluetooth is by far the best I've ever had.  I'm partially deaf and it cancels out background noises so well even I can hear voices very clearly.  There is no comparison to the three other devices I have had.  People on the other end also say I come through as if I'm sitting next to them talking.  Excellent!,5
"The bluetooth earpiece I used before this was a Plantronics Voyager 510. It was a solid product. I picked that after days of research, comparing costs, ergonomics, comfort, sound quality, and build quality. When I got it, I was tickled by it's good sound quality, comfort, ergonomics, and build quality. What it lacked was intuitive pairing and great sound quality.So that was a well-informed purchase and I may have been a little biased towards accepting it given the time I had invested.This one just fell in my lap. I had no reason to like or dislike this. But boy was I impressed.Let's start from the beginning: PairingPairing with the 510 was a chore. I frequently forgot the key sequence. With the Etymotic, you just press the big silver button until it blinks twice. That's how you turn it on and for 5 minutes, it's in discovery mode. Once paired, it connects automatically when you turn it on. Couldn't be simpler.Sound QualityFor those who aren't aware, Etymotic started off making hi-fi earbuds. Specifically, they're deal was high quality canalphones, i.e., in-ear buds. I wouldn't be surprised if this earpiece borrows heavily from some of their very fine earbuds. The difference between these and say, Plantronics, is that the voice is very natural sounding. Plantronics cleverly boosts the voice to make speech more intelligible. That comes in handy in a noisy space. The Etymotic, with its passive and active noise-cancellation, doesn't need to worry about noise infiltrating your phone call. Rather, they just try very hard to make the voice sound as much like the real-thing as possible. It's a quality you don't appreciate until you're separated from a loved one for days and you hear their voice as though they're speaking right next to you. (Yes the 510 had active noise-cancellation but it wasn't very good) And the caller isn't the only one that'll be impressed. The people I called immediately noticed the difference.DesignThe main brick is square and modern looking. Think IKEA or BoConcept. The matte silver stripe against the gloss black is cliche but pretty. The boom microphone extends along a slim gooseneck terminating in a symmetrical tapered cylinder. Again, nothing striking about it, but it's nicer looking than nearly everything out there except maybe JawBone.ConstructionI've only had it one day but it feels durable. I'm always leery about goosenecks, especially thin ones. This one has a durable feel to it, but I suspect it'll be the first thing to break. Just let it ride around in one of my field-jackets for a day and see if it lasts. Don't know. The brick feels solid enough. Feels like ABS and polycarbonate, or maybe all polycarbonate. The overall package feels solid, and for gentle-to-average users, I wouldn't worry about it. The rough sort might want to take it easy with this one. Keep it in a chest pocket, not your sides.ErgonomicsIt's ambidextrous, but I think it favors the right ear. The pointer and the middle finger will land naturally on the volume rocker which sits on top. The pointer can comfortably reach the MTB(that's what they call the big silver button, Mult-Task-Button). For left-ears like me, it's not quite as nice. You can use your thumb on the rocker, but you need to move your hand a bit to reach the MTB. The action for turning the piece on is the same as it is for turning it on, pairing, and mating: hold the MTB. Some may take that convenience for granted, but it's definitely a feature I like.ChargerIt uses a Micro-B USB charger. I'm thrilled by the growing trend of USB chargers. I may not have enough universal outlet adapters for all my tech-toys abroad, but I'll certainly have at least ONE for my laptop. If everything else can feed off that, then I'm golden! And guess what else uses a Micro-B USB port for charging...DroidMy Motorola Droid uses the same cable to charge. And what's really interesting is that this headset fits surprisingly well in my OEM docking cradle. When it's plugged in, the flat surface rests flush against the rear wall. You've got to see this to appreciate it. What this means is, I can fumble one-handed in the dark and easily get the earpiece into the docking cradle. Why I'd need to do that is another story, but it's great that I can.ComfortBut here's where they lose a star on an otherwise stellar product. This is a problem for a select few, who like myself, have smaller ear-canals. I love canalphones and I wish I could use them more often, but most of the time, they just don't fit. Long-term comfort is the problem. The pain is mild and bearable, but persistent. And if I leave it in long enough, the pain lingers after I've removed it. That's not their fault, but it's something to consider if you, the consumer, also share this anatomical quality. And since it relies on a tight fit to support itself, it can get really painful with this earpiece. But there is a cure. The included earloop rests some of the weight on lobe. With the loop in place, you don't have to plug in as deep. With the mushroom shaped foam pad, it's enough to simply rest it against the opening. It ruins the illusion of a futuristic hovering earpiece, but I'll take comfort over fashion.BOTTOM LINE: It's expensive, but I think it deserves its price-tag based on its thoughtful design and voice quality.",4
"I also have the ety*com wired noise cancelling headset and the accessories like the windscreen are the same.  I use both/either depending on what I need - my android tablet doesn't do bluetooth headset, only music.  But my phones and computers all do headset.I had a blue parrot which worked very well, but broke recently.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that although the speaker could be made loud, I could hear all the noise the cancellation was blocking so had trouble hearing the person on the other end.  In fact I hacked a earphone a lot like the ety on it which may be why it broke.  Instead of repairing it, since the wired version worked so well and the price was comparable I thought I would try the EtyBlue.Basically it is as good or better in every way I've tried it so far than my hacked blue parrot.The etyblue cancels noise as well as the blue parrot if not better.  I can have the stereo blasting and there will be an occasional quiet noisy whistle in the background but my voice comes through clearly.  And I can hear the other party over the room sounds since it is basically an earplug.It is lightweight and comfortable, and is smaller than I thought it would be from the picture.  It fits without the ear hook but I use it for extra security.Pairing is simple, the battery life is great (as good as the over-the-head), and it has all the functions, in some ways the buttons are easier.I've tried most of the rest (including the jawbone models).  This is by far the best in every category.Note it isn't a music headphone, so it won't play back or pair if it needs A2DP, only the headset/handsfree profile for phones.",5
"These screens are hard to get on without bubbles and have that 'rainbow effect'. However, once it's on, the screen looks great. I had purchased another type that went on easier and did not have the 'rainbow effect' and the screen looked terrible and grainy. I am using this protector in spite of a couple of small bubbles, simply because the screen looks clear and beautiful when lit, and that was all that really mattered to me.",3
Great for the value. Fits the captivate perfect and love all the colors.  It slips on easy and makes the phone easy to grip.,4
I bought two of them: red and white. After four months usage they are still in good condition.Pretty good for their price.,5
"I don't know why, but within the past couple months Amazon is sending requests to review products I bought years ago. The phone itself (samsung Captivate) was one I had back in 2008. While i had the phone, the rubber sheath protected it from a few falls. I'd highly recommend it.",5
This case fits onto the Captivate very snugly and perfectly. I have gotten tons of compliments and everyone asks me where I got it.,5
Love the fact it actually fits. I have tried other cases in the past and have had problems with the case actually matching the camera lens.,5
"First of all, it's super cheap.Pros:It's thick enough to give your phone good protection from accidental (or intentional) drop.All the cut-outs are very good.The material used is nonslipping, easy to grip.Cons:The case seems to easily attract dirt.the joint of the front and back piece is not treated with high quality.smells bad (typical cheap rubber smell)Summary:For this price, what can I complain?",4
"the case fits but it somewhat restricts access to the touch buttons at the bottom of the screen such as home and back.  Also if you put your phone in your pocket a lot, the rubbery texture grips onto your pocket making it hard to take out. Overall I got what i paid for. I recommend hard cases but they are usually more pricey",3
"Worked well, went on easy no bubbles",5
"I purchased this for my brother, and he found it excellent at first; loved the color. Unfortunately after a while with the phone case, it seemed that the sound is blocked off from the phone... and no longer produces sounds. I do not recommend buying this.",2
I was in the process of learning how to apply this and of course I made the biggest mess. okay,2
"This skin is really good. I bought one at one of those Worst Buy type stores for 2O bucks and I prefer this one. The pricier one is more of a slick soft plastic, this one offers much better grip on the Captivate. The one issue I have with the Captivate is the placement of the on/off/wake-up button, which is on the opposite side of the phone from the volume buttons. That placement makes it really hard to hit On/Off/Wake-up without also hitting the volume buttons. This skin really helps that; it makes it way easier to press the On/Off/Wake-up button without pressing volume. It is not quite as tight a fit as the Worst Buy skin, but it is tight enough. The price makes this purchase a must!",4
"the only thing I do not like about this product is that you cannot get all the air bubbles out from under the  plastic cover, and sometimes this hinders the touch screen operations because of the bubbles, but other than that its a great product and protects the screen",4
I purchased this case for my husband and he loves it.  It's black with no frills and he appreciates that!! It's manly!!,5
"I've had several silicon covers for various Samsung phones.  This one is, by far, one of the better fitting.  It is still typical silicone whereby it 'grabs' all lint and other stuff from your pockets, tables, or whatever and doesn't keep it's attractive appearance without routine cleaning.",4
"For only $2, this ~1.25mm thick rubbery silicone skin for the slippery smooth Samsung Galaxy S Captivate fits perfectly. Openings are cut through it for the microphone, headphone jack, micro usb, camera, and speaker, while the volume and power buttons are covered (and bumpy) but are no problem to press with the same ease as when not encased.Two minor downsides to using this plain black case VS some of the more frilly expensive alternatives: 1) There's a noticeable seam all around the edge where it came out of the mold, but you can shave it off yourself; 2) it tends to collect pocket lint and is a bit harder to slide out of your pocket, but that's a small price to pay for some added friction that'll hopefully save you from dropping this $500 phone before your contract's up.",4
"i like this case, although it is obviously cheaply made, the fit in the sides is a little lose and the button part is not very well fitted. however this is great case for the money, i ordered a white one and a black one...great deal",4
"After trying several types of cases I have decided to stay with the Silicone cases like this one for my Captivate. This red one and the black one I have are both very well made and thick enough I have no concerns of tearing or falling apart. I like the better grip of the phone the silicone provides and it is easier to hold with the extra thickness too. Access ports are cut out perfectly and the side buttons function without difficulty.I had been using the two piece hard shell cases at first but after two of them both breaking at the thin strip of screen edge plastic when access was needed to change the battery to a charged one or to get to the Micro SD card, I decided these silicone types are much less trouble overall. Just pop off, change the battery and pop on.I will say that the red in the photo of the product is more vivid than the cover I received itself, red yes, but bright red, no.I like the red to more easily see my phone since the black kind of gets lost if not carefully placed on my desk. I may even try the lime green or blue covers that are sold like this one! With the great Amazon prices it can be worth the experiment!For protection of the phone- 5 starsFunctionality with cover on- 5 starsAccess to battery and SD card- 5+ stars due to ease of removal and install of cover. Doesn't get any easier!",5
"Thick silicone case, it's still a little flimsy. If it were a little stiffer, it would be perfect. It looks like it'll protect the phone on a drop, there's a sizable ridge around the screen which is nice. All the cutouts are aligned properly, but the finish isn't perfect. The seams aren't cut flush with the case, but this should be easy to take care of with an exacto knife.",4
Honestly wasn't expecting too much since I only paid $.01 but...it was nice and thick! Great coverage...,5
"not sure as i missed placed them or maybe threw away ,didnt have a chance to use, so i cant rave or complain",3
This is the first 'skin' I had purchased for my new cell phone and I thought it couldn't be much for the price. I couldn't ask it work any better or have better features. It does everything I would ever need it to.,5
"...for protecting the screens of your electronic devices. I bought these to apply to my Captivate to keep the screen free from scratches and grime. No problems applying, just took my time and used a squeegee to get out any air bubbles. Very satisfied.",4
"Received the silicone case and was surprised at its perfectly snug fit on my Samsung Captivate. It leaves all the screen area available so none of the buttons or sensors are covered. It has perfectly fitting cutouts for the Mic, headphone plug,power cable, camera, and speaker as well as raised profile for the power and volume buttons. The phone also fits pretty well in the horizontal leather pouch I purchased.Can't beat the price!",5
the case was bent out of shape but with the rubber band around it for awhile its shape fits to the phone.,3
"I enjoy this case, it looks nice and the material is nice.The only and main problem is that the material is a little stretchy so it could fall off easily.Overall, it's a great case!",3
"Nice handy little item to have if you drop your phone like I do from time to time, I didn't like having to always carry my more bulkier leather carry case for it, the corners were still unprotected in it, this protects the corners, so I no longer worry about dropping it.  Great Buy",5
"this screen protector is great. it does great and def easy to put on. i jus wish i could have gotten more for the price, like 5 instead of 3",5
"Fits my Galaxy S Samsung i897 Captivate like a snug glove. Love it!! Some of these are to big but this one was a match made in heaven with my phone. Stays on, looks GREAT, and everyone likes it. Our twin 5 year olds didn't even know what it was suppose to be. Ah the times are a changin' lol",5
"I just ordered another set of these covers because I wear them out when I place my phone in my pocket together with my keys. The keys scratch the cover or make small pin holes on the protector, but the cover is very durable. To install, clean your screen very well. Place your phone on a dry towel on a flat, well lit surface such as table or desk.  For best results, take a small amount of dish washing soap and mix it with water. Just a dab but enough to make it slippery. Take a small towel or wash cloth & dip it in the soap & water mix & wipe it on the screen so that it is wet, but not puddled or soaked. You don't want so much that it seeps into the phone & damages the electronics, but a light amount is ok. Place the screen protector on the phone & align it perfectly along the edges of the screen and use a credit card - the edge of the credit card to squeeze the water & air bubbles out. Use a dry towel to soak up all the excess water as it seeps out the sides. Leave under a warm lamp to allow the clear plastic cover to dry & when it is all dry, it will be difficult to tell you even have a protective cover on your phone screen. Best to do it at night so you can let it dry over night. Let dry preferably under a warm lamp to speed up drying. Note: The cover will still move while still wet. When it dries, it is like window tint, clear, on the screen with no bubbles and on the screen very well. I've done this many times to all my phones and for all my friends.",5
"It made my phone look crappy. The sides kept coming up. The thing just would stay on. Also, the ones I received did NOT have that special cutout at the top, it was just a straight line.",1
"great price & great quality. i got this for his phone & my phone & the price i would never be able to get it anywhere else like that,",5
"They worked. Not perfectly, but worked non the less. I would buy again if I still had a droid x.",4
"After much research this is my second brand or type I've tried and works great, and at the time the price was reasonable",5
"These are thicker than most, and if your like me and have a droid x, when you go to radio shack or best buy they rarely have the screen protector that fits this screen, just the universal one you have to cut down. Would not have an un-cracked screen today if it were not for having a screen protector on it. A must buy if you own a smart phone.",5
"Tried buying several screen protectors off of Amazon for my Droid 3.  The only ones that really work are sold directly in Verizon stores.  All the protectors sold online cover up the light sensor on the front of the phone, which prevents the keyboard backlight from turning on when necessary, as well as prevents screen activation when you bring the phone away from your ear while on a call (to 'press 1' or something like that).  Just go to your local Verizon store and spend the extra $5 for something that works.",2
"I'm not sure how this product received all of the glowing reviews - maybe I received a bad package - but these screen protectors are really bad: they are slightly oversized, which causes all sorts of problems as they are not flush to the phone.  As a result, I just threw the package away as it wasn't worth taking this cheap item down to the post office to return back to Amazon.  They are cheap - from a cost standpoint - and this proves the point you get what you pay for with items like these.",1
"This is a cheap plastic product, and is brittle and will break.  It will not protect your phone. Save your money. Please.",1
"Cheap.Plastic tabs that are to grip the phone and hold in place break off very easily.Buy two,  at this price though its still a deal.Just don't drop your phone and it'll last longer than a day or two....",1
Wish I'd read these reviews first. Wife liked the color but it rubs off on the hands of whoever touches it.,1
"It is extremely pink but I haven't experienced what other people say with the pink coming off on my ear or hands but I'm not a serious talker on my phone.  I'm usually not on the phone for more than 20 or 30mins with a good friend, sweat probably has alot to do with it too.  It does look a little cheapy made around some of the edges where it snapes in at but you get what you pay for so if I start having serious issue with this case I will just get a silicon one.I was hoping the pink would be a little darker like the ipod touch Griffin hard rubberized case at Walmart, but the shade is one shade too light so not crazy about it but the purple was not that attractive to me at all; I can live with it though.",3
Love the color!  It's exactly what I was hoping for.  The hole for the speaker on the back isn't as large as pictured but that doesn't cause any major problems.  The case is smooth to touch and it fits very well.,4
I was very afraid for the price I paid that this would break the second I tried to put my SIII with its 7000 milliamp Extended Battery in it.  Surprisingly this holds up very well. No problems with the suction cup on this one either. I have 2 cars and I tried another with a suction cup issue. So overall this is awesome.,5
"Got this to replace an old 'name brand' window mount that the suction cup had failed on, and for the price, I wasn't expecting much. But this thing is actually a pretty nice mount. It feels sturdy, seems built well and works perfectly. In fact, it's more sturdy that the name-brand unit it's replacing. The suction cup holds strong and is easy to position and install. The 'neck' is a bit stiff, but that's normal as it keeps your phone in place. They even give you a disc to put on your dash in case it's illegal to put things on the windshield in your location. I'm really having a hard time finding any fault with this mount at all.Recommended.",5
on the first time I was gonna use it the suction cup for the windshield just broke on first try,1
"I bought this because it seemed sturdy enough to hold my Samsung Epic phone. At first it was great but it just would not stay on my windshield. On the plus side, every time it fell off my phone was still in the holder.",2
misleading at first but got used to it.,3
"These batteries work as well as the OEM one that came with the phone. No problem at all holding a charge. The charger surprisingly enough, works well too. It has a light that changes color when the battery is charged and is portable, with a folding plug. Nice design. Great deal for what I paid.",5
Purchased the batteries and charger for my HTC EVO 4G phone.  The product came FAST...I couldn't believe it.  The charger is very easy to use with the batteries.  I noticed 1 of the 2 batteries was defective so I contacted QuickShippers and had a free replacement on its way to me as soon as I sent the defective battery back. FAST and FRIENDLY Customer Service!  I'm very pleased.  Well worth it!!!  Thanks QuickShippers!!,5
"I bought the two battery & charger package from YESOO.At the time, it was under $10, with free shipping.(prices fluctuate hourly, so don't worry 'bout it) ;)A buddy has the HTC EVO from Sprint, and it's a real battery hog.I got this as a gift, because I knew he wouldn't go for the 3500mahbattery pack. (wouldn't fit into his Otterbox case)YESOO managed to get it from the east coast to the west in 7 days, even over the New Years holiday.I was worried about the mixed reviews, so I shot them an email.They replied immediately that it would fit the EVO, and I'd be pleased.Just got it today, and so far, I AM !We'll give it a week or two of daily operation, and see how it goes.If all is well, I'll let this review stand.For now, I'm giving it 5 stars.I did mark the two new batteries. One with a red dot, the other green.That way, it'll be easier to keep track of which battery is which.The charger has a soft blue glow when finished, or with no battery.While actively charging, the glow is bright red!Choose where to put your charger, if you don't like a nite lite. :)",5
"Well, the charger does charge the batteries, and the batteries do work in my phone, the batteries don not hold a charge as long as the stock battery.",3
"Overall an awesome buy!  I highly recommend.The batteries are 1500mah, a little less than the stock battery but not that noticeable. The convenient part is, they're small enough and cheap enough that I can carry one or two extra if I know I have a long train or plane ride ahead. I can get about 1.5 to 2 hours of streaming video from a full charge on the stock battery, and about the same from each of these.I was looking at getting the 3500 mah extended battery, except that it cost roughly 5 times what this kit does, and this includes the charger!  Oh, and the charger is real convenient too. I can just throw a dead battery on it, put a fresh one in the phone, and walk away, I dont have to leave my phone tethered to the wall. It does have a USB output though, so you can plug the phone into it if you want to. You can even charge the phone by USB while a second battery charges.",5
The battery is 1/16' thicker than the original battery comes with the phone.So the back cover doesn't shut completly.,1
This was a great buy for the price. Beats having to buy a new cellphone due to damaged charge port.,4
"It takes a bit of time to charge the batterias, but with the two included I never have to worry about running out of battery. thanks!",5
"As soon as you get it you need to have it charge for atleast 8-9 hrs, then hope that it will hold a charge for at least half as long. Just to make sure there are no problems instructions would help.",3
"After losing my first wall charger, I bought a second one because it was so cheap and got me two more batteries.  I initially bought it for the extra batteries and considered the wall charger an added bonus (that later proved necessary).  When going out or going camping/places without electricity it's great to grab an extra battery or two (especially for a phone like the EVO that runs through a battery in 3 hours of heavy use) and know that you don't have to conserve or recharge for a few days.Everything worked on arrival and a year later.",5
"I chose this battery for the price, a lot cheaper than the original, and to my surprise it worked a lot better than I expected.",5
The batteries work and the charger is great for having multiple batteries for any good reason. I wish other companies had a similar idea for batteries.,5
"I bought this charger so I could charge an extra battery while I was charging my phone with an extended battery.  the extra batteries are a plus! Gave one to my wife so she has an extra just in case she needs it.  You can't beat it for the price, so far the batteries last as long as the one that comes with the EVO.  I know it sounds crazy, but it's nice to have an extra battery to take with, you the battery on the EVO only last about eight hours.",5
This is a great alternative when my charging port was broken on my Evo 4G. It takes a little while to charge but thats probably because I was use to a rapid charge when the port actually worked.,4
"Hi!  I own an HTC Droid Incredible and these batteries work OK for it.  My Incredible is not so incredible anymore, in that the port where you plug it in to charge it has broken.  So, it won't take a charge.  I've had the phone for awhile now, and I do plug and unplug it a lot, so it seems that the port finally gave out.  What to do?  I need to get that battery charged!  I went to a Verizon store, and they couldn't help me at all.  Radio shack had nothing either.  I found this pretty odd - the two places that should most definitely carry a wall-charger for your cell phones' battery has nothing.  TO THE INTERNET: Within seconds I found not only this, but some others on here as well.  And CHEAP!  Dirt cheap, in fact!  Well worth the risk!  I mean, I get a wall charger AND two batteries?  Excellent!  The charger I received is black and has a USB port on the side, but there's no USB cord that came with it.  I'm not sure how that port is meant to be used - maybe if the battery is in the charger and not plugged into the wall, you can use it to power the phone?  When you plug a battery into this unit, then plug it into the wall, a purple-ish red-ish light turns on - telling you it's charging, I assume.  When it's fully charged, the light turns a really cool bright blue.  All done!  Takes about 5-6 hours to fully charge, but I am just grateful it works and I can finally use my cell phone again!-A note:  Some people here say this charger does not work with extended batteries.  That is only partially true.  The battery from your phone fits into this charger 'backwards', meaning that the part facing you as you take it out of the phone actually faces in towards the charger as you plug it in.  So, if you have an extended battery that is thicker than the original battery, it won't work on this charger.  I DO have an extended battery, but it is the same dimenions as the original battery, and therefore works and charges just fine on this unit.  So, don't expect this to charge some thick after-market battery; It only works on batteries that are the exact same size as the original.-** UPDATE 9/13/2011 **These batteries don't last very long.  Maybe 24 hours, tops, with moderately heavy use of the phone.  I'm disappointed, but don't care so long as I can still USE it until the iphone 5 comes out!!!",3
"Great setup, the batteries have performed well as companions to my original... Love to have one fresh battery in phone, one fully charged in my pocket and one charging on the charger (I have a DC converter in my truck under my console and have the charger with me at all times that way)... when the battery in my phone gets too low, I exchange it for the fresh one in my pocket and the next trip to my truck, I exchange the fully charged one with the drained one... always have phone power.. these batteries have lasted well and keep a decent charge after many many months, but they are not as robust as the original... I actually just purchased another genuine Samsung battery to supplement this arrangement... overall a MUST HAVE for the constant phone user like me - who surfs, emails, listens to music 24/7...",4
battery fits but the phone does not recognize it.  there is only an exclamation point over the battery so you cannot tell how charged the battery is,3
"Im happy with this product it seems to hols a charge better than the battery that came with my android phone, and its always good to be able to change battery on the go when one dies",5
When I ordered this charger I couldn't believe I was able to find one product like this. It's very helpful for me. I'm glad I ordered this charger.,5
"I ordered the wall charger & batteries for my boyfriend, as his charging port doesn't work on his phone (HTC EVO 4G). So far the charger works as it should, and he's yet to complain about it. The batteries don't last very long, but we use the charger mainly for his original HTC battery, so that's not a problem.Definitely a good product for the price- I'd recommend this to those looking for a travel charger who don't want to spend a fortune on one.",4
The batteries work just as well as the one my phone came with and the charger has a bright light showing when they're ready.  It's a huge difference having a couple of extra batteries to get you through the day.  I recommend this to all HTC EVO 4G owners.,5
"Can't beat the price. If the batteries aren't equal to the original I haven't noticed. I keep an extra battery with me and I dont have to worry about reducing the bells and whistles on my EVO. The wall charger takes twice as long to charge but it doesnt matter because you have two extra batteries; one charges in the phone the other on the wall and a spare on the side.Best deal out there. So dont worry about going nuts saving your battery life, spend the 20 and get 2 extra batteries and a wall charger.",5
"Like most people, I'm disappointed by the battery life on my Evo. These two batteries last just as long as the stock battery, and now that I have three batteries I can just swap them out as they run low. The charger isn't the fastest charger in the world, but with three batteries it doesn't need to be. It charges the battery faster than the phone runs it down, so I always have at least one fully charged battery standing by with another in the charger and the third in my phone. And you can't beat the price!!!",5
"The product works fine, but the battery life is still disappointing. I was using these for an HTC Hero, and the hassle of carrying around a second battery was almost not worth the extended battery life.Best if you have a shoulder bag to carry it in for a long working day. Not fun to carry a second battery around if you're out socializing.",3
"These batteries are great. I can go through a whole day of surfing without charging my phone. I just make sure my phone and the spear batteries are charged before I leave the house in the morning.One thing that bothered me was I ordered these with a friend of mine on the same day. Her's arrived 3 days later whereas mine took about 12 days. Other than that, I am really pleased with this purchase.",4
"this turned out to be a waste.  I only like the fact you can charge you phone, and battery at the same time with this unit. The batteries are useless.. I thought that they would last longer, or be better, but they don't, & aren't.",2
"I received this last week. I must say I loved the extremely minimalist packaging! Two batteries shrink wrapped with the charger and a sticker placed on the shrink wrap. I ordered it with another item and when the small box came in the mail I initially wondered which item wasn't included! Happily I received both due to the shrink wrap approach!  I've charged up one of the batteries and given it to my aunt to use as a back up for her EVO Shift. The second I will give to my father as a back up for his EVO Shift. I already had a spare battery for my EVO and I've been using the charger to ensure my spare and my phone battery are both fully charged each morning. No complaints in the short time I have had these items so far. I will update my review if any of the three... batteries or charger... proof less than satisfactory.Feb 6, 2012 Update to original review from June 1, 2011 -Well over 7 months later the batteries are still going strong. The charger still works. I just ordered 2 more of these kits for my parents and sister to use with their EVO Shift phones from Sprint. I'd say I more than got my money's worth!!!May 3, 2013 - Well these batteries are toast now. Both of them started to swell, a fact we noticed when the phones they were in started to last roughly 10 minutes if that on a full charge. I pulled the batteries out of the phone & advised my parents not to put them back in their phones. We aren't going to buy more as we are all eligible for full upgrade discounts but I'm not sure I'd go with an off market battery again if we get phones were we can even replace the battery. After the first year with these things the amount of time gotten out of them dropped like a rock on a week by week basis.",3
"Seems to be working fine so far. I fatty batteries already charged in purse for emergency. So yes, I would recommend it totally.",5
"I've used these for approximately one month. It was a huge pain to deal with the HTC Evo's battery life, as I could never get through a day without it dying. Now I don't even have to use my cable anymore... I just charge up whatever batteries I'm not using with the wall charger.So far the charge capacity is basically identical, if not better, than the HTC battery. 100% worth it.",5
"This item was great for 6 months and then it died. One of the metal connectors to the battery broke and that was the end of the charger. It was an inexpensive purchase and it came with 2 batteries that still work, but I need to use a different charger. Even with the low price, I had hoped it would last longer.",1
"Charger wasn't exactly as pictured: charger shown at time of order was white, item received was black (improvement?). Both batteries hold a charge very well, better than my 8-month-old OEM battery. Much more convenient than charging 1/2-way through the day.",5
"This was exactly as described and exactly what I wanted.  The batteries last about 70% of the time my original battery lasts, but allow me to get through a long work day or a road trip with no need for recharging.",5
I was hesitant to buy since the product was not OEM. Fortunately it has the same specs as the original and the wall charger is awesome!,5
"I ordered this for my HTC EVO. The batteries that come with this package states they are 1500mAh. Original HTC-EVO battery that comes with phone also is 1500mAh, but a full charge lasts almost twice as the two batteries that come with this package. I seriously suspect if these batteries are 1500mAh.The charger itself does what it suppose to do. It is not a fast charger. It charges the two batteries in this package (fully drained) in about 4.15 hours, but it takes almost 6.5 hours to charge the original HTC battery from fully drained to fully charged. The charger has a light that when charging is in progress is purple. When the charge completes, it changes to blue.Considering the price of a new original HTC battery for EVO at Amazon for $8.99 (As of this review date), you might want to consider to buy an additional HTC battery also. The lowest price I could find for chargers that can charge batteries individually for other brands also starts at $26.99 (As of this review date). Considering this charger basically is giving you two half batteries for free not bad.",3
Product works great.... everyone is very impressed when they ask me about my charger and how much I paid for it. And honestly the 2 batteries you sent me work better than my original evo battery!,5
"The batteries arrived quickly.  The charger works great. The LED light on it is very bright.  The two batteries at first worked much better then the stock one that had come with my Touch Pro 2 (that was about two years ago.)After about a month, I'd say that one of the replacement batteries is slightly better then the other and both are just a hair better then the original battery but not dramatically better as they were in the beginning. The batteries were a perfect fit for my phone and had no problems replacing them.Having to remember to take the extra batteries off the charger and put them in my bag each day for backups is a bit of work but it's overall a good system and just as good if not more convenient then using a charging cable.The price was great and I wish I had bought these when I first bought the phone.  When I upgrade to a newer model phone soon, I'll be sure to buy another set just like this!",4
The batteries will not stay connected if you move the device at all. They fall out very easily and it doesn't indicate if the battery is charged or not. It will just keep charging...,2
Htc evo user must have item. Wont go anywhere with out them. Or ull regret when u need it the most. It works like the original battery.,4
"So far, I have no complaints for the charger. It is absolutely wonderful! It has come in handy and saved me so many times since I received it. The best things about it are, not only does it give my electronics a full charge but it charges them really quickly! Much quicker than normal. So much so that I've started using it to charge my items versus just plugging them in an outlet. I love that it is small and compact. I can carry it in my purse and take it with me to work (or anywhere i go). Lastly, I think it is great that the charger will charge just about any item!",5
I use this iCarrier when I travel-inside and outside the states.It is great to be able to carry it w/ me to charge my iPhone and iPad when needed. It is not too bulky (very decent bulk/weight for the performance). I do not have to worry about carrying an outlet adapter with me and I get full charges to both my iPad and iPhone at the same time.A great safety backup battery to have for any reason.,5
"I really like this for when I need to be on the go. The one flaw that I found was that it requires a battery, which is ironic, but quite handy! 5 stars!",5
"I have several New Trent portable chargers, this is my second one like this. (My toddler threw our other one over the banister down to the hardwood floor below. Surprisingly it still worked after we put it back together... I needed a new one though after a year with my 1st one taped together lolI recommend this charger to anyone wanting to charge their phone on the go. This lasts all day long so I can charge my phone anytime anywhere. I charge the battery pack at night and then it's ready for a new day. Definitely the best and worth the money.",5
"I bought this for one purpose only, for my upcoming 23 hours trip to USA because i'm planning to watch back-to-back Family Guy episodes on iPad to kill time...My only comment is why not include a tiny small LCD screen that shows the percentage of remaining power instead of the (HIGH, MID, LOW) only. This could give you wrong impression of how much juice is left, assuming it is equally distributed (Low=%0-%33, Mid=%34-%66, HIGH=%67-%100) then a Low indicator could mean anything between 0mA and 3600mA = you ran out of juice or you can charge your Android phone one & half times! That's a big difference in my opinion! A small LCD is a simple solution for accurately telling how much power is left and even for you to notice when the battery starts losing charge quickly = time to purchase new one. You may say it defeats the purpose as it consumes from stored power, i say put a tiny button that activates the screen for 5 seconds, you read how much charge is left then it goes auto-off. I don't think that will consume much power.I hope they take my recommendation for later models. Other than that, I still give it 5 stars when i compare Price Vs  Physical Size Vs Battery Size Vs Nice Looks compared with other models available in the market.==EDIT 11 JANUARY 2014==I slashed down the review from 5 stars to 1 star because the battery died after 14 months of very, very light use. Went to the manufacturer webpage to check on warranty but i discovered that they offer 10 months warranty AND ONLY for registered products (you have to register within 15 days of purchase!!!!) After this experience, i am staying away from Trent, I will find another portable battery product!",1
First off this portable charger is probably the best one you will find on the market no questions asked. If someone asked me to recommend a portable charger it would definitely recommend this. The New Trent Rechargeable external battery is a great product if one or two of your devices keep running low on battery. This product will be able to charge your device to the max at least 6 times over. You can even charge 2 devices at one time! You can tell just by holding this that it is very durable and will last a lifetime. It includes a very nice looking black carrying case. You charge the device via micro usb which is a positive. One thing they could add is probably another USB port but for me 2 is fine. I give this 5 stars with no dislikes.,5
"I received the IMP120D two days ago and I must say, this product is an absolute MUST for everyone who depends on their electronic devices extensively for school, work, or pleasure. This external battery packs 12,000mAh which translates to a whole lot of power! I have been using my iPad 4 with retina display extensively for the past two days non-stop and I have not had to stop and charge on a wall plug AT ALL. Just today, I had an 8 hour shift at work, 4 hours at school, and created an 80 slide powerpoint presentation - thank to the IMP120D I am still at 48% (without charging since Monday 06-24-13). The battery also comes with two USB ports if you want to charge your phone as well as your tablet simultaneously. If you're always on the go, this is a product I give 5 stars on style, usefulness, and portability..Pros:1). Stylish2). Light weight3). Holds extensive amount of power4). Very thin / Small5). Comes with a small pouch to hold the battery6). Has two USB cables to charge your phone and tabletCons:1). Should come with small rubber feet to prevent sliding on hard surface2). Color options would be nice (seems most NewTrent products come in blue/black only)3). The charging cable is very short, a slightly longer cable would be nice",5
"I bought this after getting their 6000mah one as a present. I was able to fully charge a Nexus 7, and Evo 4g twice on a single charge, which is pretty crazy. I like that the pack shuts off automatically when your device is done charging, which means it wasn't unnecessarily sending power to a full device. Definitely taking this with me to my next Seahawk game to keep my phone fully charged.",5
"The iCarrier is a lifesaver.  My family went on our annual camping trip,  and this was the first time that we had some backup power, thanks to this device.  It lasted throughout the whole weekend,  charging many things,  including the iPhone 4 and 5,  Samsung Galaxy S2,  and a couple of bluetooth headsets.  I also had a phone interview during the camping trip,  so without this battery pack,  I probably would have missed the phone call because my phone would run of battery.  I would definitely recommend this product!",5
Worked great for my long flight. The only problem is that I had to be careful when putting it back into my bag so I wouldn't accidentally turn it on. Other than that it kept my phone charged for me during my long layover.,4
I bought this battery pack for my droid and my Kindle Fire. I take it EVERYWHERE I go when I bring more then one device. My husband and I use this continuously! It seems we are always on our phones and tablets. NO MORE running out of battery! No more scrambling to find a plug in so my phone isn't dead for my kids to get ahold of me. I am always charged up now! If I could give this more then 5 stars I would. It deserves way more! Comes with a nice fabric case to carry it in. I will NEVER be without this one if I have more then one device with me. If I only have one... I got the smaller version which is the New Trent iTorch. New Trent makes some amazing products and if your on the go and find yourself always plugging your phone in - in the car or wherever - this is the product for you! Don't worry about not having a full battery ever again!,5
"I use my HTC Inspire as a WiFi hotspot for my Galaxy Tab 10.1. I can drain the phone battery in 3-hours. One charge of the Trent, I was able to charge my phone from 20% to 100% five times and I still had 50% juice left. I wanted to drain the unit so I hooked it up to my Tab 10.1 to finish it off. It took several hours to finish off, it even took my Tab from 40% charge to 70% charge.Typical day, 2 plus hours in the airport surfing on my tab. On the plane, I hook up my phone to the Trent and when I get off the plane, my phone battery is a 100%. This is much better than getting off the plane with a dead phone battery. The extra juice gives me a lot of flexibility.I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",5
"Instead of a laptop, I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1&#34; tablet.  My only problem was that I couldn't find a convenient way to charge it at the end of the day that didn't require me to be outlet adjacent.  This is perfect and will charge my bluetooth keyboard or smartphone at the same time.  My only complaint is that it's a little bulky, so it doesn't fit as well into my bag as I would like, but it does such a great job, it's worth the bulk.",4
"Pro - Capacity is great, lots of life to recharge multiple things in between charges.  Finish is great, love the blue LED's!Cons - A little bulky and heavy, but that may just be the trade off for the amount of power it can hold.  Would love to see a non-slip surface incorporated somewhere on the unit.  I will recharge my phone/tablet on a table or desk or on a plane, and a non-slip surface would be invaluable.4 stars, only because I would like to have the non-slip surface incorporated somewhere on the unit.",4
"Pros: The charger feels very solid. It has two USB ports and one 2A USB port for tablets and the second 1A USB port for other devices like phones. It took me days to drain this battery with my iPhone 4. The battery also did a very good job charging my tablet.Cons: It is a bit heavy. I do not like the blue on the unit. I would much prefer an all black variant of this charger. Trent devices still do not include an iPhone power cable because of license issues.Other thoughts: I think I'm going to stick with the iTorch to charge my phone because of it's smaller size and lighter weight. If I were to go on camping for a few days, then I would definitely bring my iCarrier to charge my HP Touch Pad and iPhone.",5
"I had this for about a year and still working strong. It has been very useful in emergency situations. These battery packs are indispensable in this day and age in my opinion, and long lasting, many cycle recharge with no loss in capacity is key to great portable battery pack. This is it.only thing I don't like is proprietary charging cable. Not very convenient.",5
"The New Trent IMP120 provides easy, reliable portable power.  Owning several devices, our family devices vary from droid phones, iphones, ipods, to the kindle and IPads, it has proven to be an essential part of my travel gear.  I take it with me on personal and business travel, and don't have to worry about access to an AC source no matter where I am.  Even brought one to Disneyland knowing that one of the family phones would drain throughout the long day, and it really was reassuring to have it so we could stay in contact at the park.What I like about the device is its portability as well as ability to charge and recharge my devices.  I have owned the older and now have the two port USB model.  With the newer model now having 12000 mAhrs of battery life, it can easily recharge my iPad (as long you don't drain the iPad battery)  or several phones to full power before needing recharging itself.Compared to similar devices , it is competitively priced and simple to use, compatible with most phone and devices.The downside to the device is its slight bulk and weight, however, this is to be expected for the amount of juice that it allows you to carry.  Also, they provide a neat and fancy carrying case, but it is only just big enough to fit the device and not the charging cord or any other USB cords that you would intuitively want to bring.  It may have been a good idea to include a sleeve into the carrying case to accommodate most smart phones.  In addition, if you have a Samsung galaxy, you will need to use an included USB converter which seems easily lost.The device is rated for about 500 charges, about what you would expect from a backup battery source.  However, having owned one for about a year with probably intermediate amount of use, it still holds it charge very well and has not had any issues whatsoever.I am a pretty picky consumer and now have two of these devices, and that is as good as a recommendation I can give!",5
,5
"As a backup battery, this does all it says it does. I have charged a total of about 8,000 MaH so far and the battery light is still at 2/3 so I'm sure it will last at least the stated 12,000 MaH.For it to be perfect:Make it a little thinner if possible. If the size is needed, it would be more convenient to be be longer and thnner rather than the squat square shape it is now - over an inch thick.Add a direct charging plug - If this could plug directly into the wall it would be excellent. The current adapter it comes with is quite large.Built in charging wires - I have seen many backup batteries with a built in micro-USB plug to charge phones.Add another USB outlet. Why not be able to charge three things at once.But as far as doing what is says it does it is perfect.",4
"I purchased this device because I do a lot of traveling and use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4g tablet and a Droid Razr Maxx Phone extensively. I previously had a smaller device purchased from Verizon but it would hardly move the battery level of the phone much less the tablet. The IMP120D will keep my phone charged for as long as I need throughout the day and can put a full charge on my Kindle Fire.I have not fully exhausted the charge on this yet.The device is a great size for me, it does not take up much room in my backpack and is very light. It comes with excellent instructions and is very easy to use. Simply plug in your device's USB cable and turn it on. To recharge simply plug into an outlet and wait for the led lights to stop flashing to indicate that it is fully charged. The led indicators show you where the device is at in terms of capacity so that you know when you will be needing to charge it.This is a good looking device as well with a nice black gloss finish and blue accents.It is nicely packaged to secure it during shipping and the instructions are written well. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for extra capacity for their mobile devices. Do not buy the overpriced accessories from you cell phone company as they are very weak and a waste of money in my opinion.",5
A ton of juice to charge devices.  It works with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus and my Ipad and will charge both at the same time.  I was looking for a solar charger (still am) and came across this.  I had not really thought about just a big battery back up but this one does everything I need it to do and charges quickly.,5
We already have two of the 500mAh Trent power packs and me and my wife use them daily but when it comes to travelling this unit is preferred as you can charge just about anything you can throw at it.Good charge time. No excessive heat.,5
"this battery provides many uses, especially when I'm traveling. I have been very useful and is an excellent product. i recommend it",5
I gave this as a gift to my brother-in-law and he loves it. It is able to charge all his devices including the 3rd Gen iPad.,5
I love this battery pack. I purchased it quite a while back and haven't had any issues with it whatsoever. It exceeded my expectations. I take it on long trips to Michigan to visit family and it charges two smartphones the whole trip there and all the way back without ever going dead itself. Great buy for your money. I recommend to anyone who travels alot or anyone who never wants to loose charge on your electronic devices.,5
"My wife & I are Apple device fanatics, however we will only use Windows for computers.  Apple can never make a computer as powerful as what you can create on your own, but they make beautifully designed phones & tablets that unfortunately have one battery & it can't be swapped very easily.  The iPhone and like devices are not designed to be open in order to switch in a backup battery, therefore we all turn to these devices.  I can personally vouch for this charger that it is the best!  Look at the 12,000mAh!!  That means you can get quite a few full charges out of it before it's dead.  Charging time, I believe is around 14 hours, but it doesn't dissipate nearly as fast as what I had assumed.  We were able to fly from Asia to LA, then to Chicago, then a 4 hour drive, without any of our devices dying.  Keep in mind, we were using our phones & ipods & ipads the entire time of the flights.  The charger not only charges our devices the same (if not faster) speed as a regular plugin charger, but it shuts off automatically after an estimated 30 seconds of the device being fully charged.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! But, if you drop it, it will not work.  Wife accidentally dropped ours on concrete, and I had to pick up a replacement.  It wasn't broken as far as the eye could tell, but something must have got &#34;jiggled&#34; inside.  Treat it like a baby, and it will love you back :)  GREAT BUY!",5
"This is a super fast recharge for my Samsung Galaxy II phone, which needs a lot of charging.  I'll never have to complain about a dead battery again.  The second port is a great feature too.  This charged my phone faster than my car charger!",5
charger is great for when i'm in class or on the go and am not near an outlet. charges fast too. highly recommend,5
"VERSATILE... RELIABLE... and HIGH QUALITY.. For a person working in a techy environment and loving/having too many techy stuff, this is a must have!Have you been in situations where you need to do something important with your phone but you failed to notice earlier that you're already almost running out of juice? And what's worse is that even how much you tried to look for some way you can recharge your phone, there's just no easy way. Oh well, say goodbye to your problem with the help of this New Trent iCarrier IMP120D. Husbands (like me), sorry but you have no excuse your phone run out of juice anymore (wives, rejoice).PROS:- Small, it fits most pants pockets- Lightweight, won't require big muscles to carry- Juicy, w/ 12000mAh you can bring a lot of gadgets back to life (I have the following gadgets with me most of the time: Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Wireless Headset, Beats Wireless, iPad Mini... But wait, there's more (from my wife), she has iPhone 5, iPod Classic. I was not able to power them all at once (because there's only 2 USB sockets) but I was able to charge them all in one full charging of my New Trent iCarrier IMP120D.- Versatile, I used to have Mophie battery packs but it didn't last and it's not very versatile like this because it is using fixed iPhone(30 pin) plug. Guess what, when I bought my Samsung Galaxy S4 and even my new iPad Mini(using lightning plug), I can't use it anymore. What's worse is that it cost me $50 before and I can't even charge a second phone with it.- 2 is better than 1! w/ 2 USB ports, what could be better than that? I know, 1 USB port w/ 1A and 1 USB port w/ 2.1A. I also like the battery level indicator (LOW, MED, HIGH).CONS:- Pouch bag. It could be better. I prefer using Micro Fiber Cloth than that. But a rugged case would also be ideal for adding protection to the unit.- LED Lights. I prefer to be able to turn of the LED lights especially when I'm charging. I would suggest turning it off automatically after 5 seconds when you're using the unit for charging and you'll be able to turn it on again with one push of the on/off button to check the battery level.WHAT ELSE COULD MAKE THIS EVEN BETTER:- All-In-One USB plug included in the package (like this: B005JZP4QQ but with lightning plug too. I know, I know, I hate Apple too for not using standard USB for their devices, but what else can we do, right??",5
"This is not the first time I have purchased New Trent products and with my past purchases, I knew I was expecting something of a high capacity external battery that has a smaller form factor. The way it was designed is so simple yet so helpful in charging my mobile devices on the go and it completely charges my phone even if I am continuously using my phone at the same time. Charging the external battery takes time but that is normal knowing that it hold at least 4-6 times the capacity of our handheld devices. Also, it has successfully charged pretty much anything that I plug into it as since it has dual USB ports which is the conventional way to connect and charge devices.I would gladly recommend this product to anyone any day but depending on their needs and space, I would recommend them the right product that will cover their needs.",5
"This battery pack really helps the mobile road warrior who has many devices and needs peace of mind to re-charge items. I have understood the weight factor and is not too bad considering what it can accomplish. Just search the battery packs for ones of this capacity (hint, take a look at the number of mAh the devices have) and you'll quickly see that NewTrent did a good job of packing it in into a small, roundish package. So far so good!...very good.",5
The New Trent iCarrier IMP120D is VERY handy and easy to use.  Whenever I am away from 'a plug' I still am confident that my phone and pad will have plenty of battery charge to take care of my needs.  I think this is one of those products everyone should have.,5
Excellent external battery for anyone that needs one.The dual ports are very useful.Charges at a decent rate of speedCan recharge my Note 3 about 2.5 times,5
"I actually returned this because it was a bit bigger than the New Trent iGeek IMP99D/NT99D 9900mAh.  This one charges faster though, but I sacrificed speed for a smaller size.  Still a great charger.  Probably top of the line.",5
"The battery is really nice and powerful, I'm planing to traveling aboard and would use this one the flights for charging my Ipad and my BlackBerry.Usually the Ipad cannot be charged by usb, which I meant the usb from either the computer or the iHome duck.But this one just right for the iPad, so glad to get it!",5
I bought this battery to have backup recharging for my cell phone and iPad on a trip to Europe.  I have given it a trial run to see how well it would charge both of them.  I think it charges both the iPad and the Android phone at least as fast as the wall charger.,5
This charger is very high quality and works well.Pros----------CompactLarge capacityLow priceCarrying caseEasy usageIncluded cableCons----------Glossy finish (I would rather have a rubbery matte coating),5
"I travel a lot by motorcycle, camping half the time. I cannot count how often my phone has gone dead and I had no electric power to recharge it. This causes me to wait until I either get a hotel room or find some place I can plug in my charger. This 11000mAh External Battery is a life saver. This bad-boy will recharge my phone numerous times and run my laptop for hours on end, never needing a recharge itself. It you travel to areas that limit your access to power to recharge your phone, laptop, camera or just about any other electronic device, this is a must. They make smaller sizes, but why limit yourself. This portable battery is about the same size of a deck of cards, but almost twice as thick. I would give it 10 stars if it was an option!!UPDATE: I had only used this device once. I bought it to carry on my motorcycle trips so my cell phone could be charged and possibly my Netbook also. However, although I kept it charged monthly to have it ready when needed. So the other day I was getting my stuff together for a weekend get away and noticed my New Trent would not come on when the button was pushed. So figuring the battery had run down, I plugged it in to recharge. The next morning (22 hours later) I unplugged the charger to check my New Trent and nothing happened, it won't turn on. I checked the Trouble Shooting guide, which was no help what so ever. So this $99 piece of junk is totally worthless. Of course turning it over and seeing in big letters 'made in China' offers the explanation I expected, I had bought another piece of Chinese junk.. An item such as this is supposed to be trustable, because you buy something like this for the reason to prevent being away from an electrical outlet and not having your cell phone go dead leaving you without any form of communication. Being ripped off on a piece of junk really bothers me. I am very disappointed in Amazon for selling junk.",1
"I have only had the IMP120D for a couple weeks now, and I love it. The device is very easy to use and holds more than enough power for my devices. I am constantly on my electronics and playing games and this device is perfect for  me!!",5
"This review is for the New Trent iCarrier IMP120D (12000mAh) Charger.This is my 3rd charger from New Trent.  My first one was an iCarrier, (but back then there was only one usb port to charge your items).  My 2nd was the New Trent iGeek 11,200mAh, and now I'm buying another iCarrier. So far, this is my favorite.This has to be one of THE best products out there for people who use their mobile devices constantly.  It addresses one of the biggest complaints that people have with their smartphones- running out of battery so fast! The New Trent iCarrier charger makes that a non-issue.I bought this one just before getting ready to fly across the county to visit my parents.  I watched videos for my 7 hour flight, and then,while everyone else was scrambling to look for a plug to recharge their pads and phones during the layover in Atlanta, I sat back and plugged my New Trent charger into my iphone and watched TV shows during my 2 1/2 hour layover, and then got back on the plane with a full iphone and watched some more videos.  I still had plenty to spare when I got to my parents and used it to charge a few more times.I also have a habit of watching shows through the night since I have terrible insonmia, and I have no plug near my bed, so my New Trent charger is basically my nightly charger as well.  So my New Trent chargers get PLENTY of use every single day!I have had several of my friends and family ask me where I got this, and as soon as I tell them, they have immediately ordered one for themselves.I especially like the fact that on this unit, you must press and hold the button for a second or two to start the charging to your mobile device.  This keeps the charger from turning on accidentally when in your purse or bag.Its not the smallest unit, but considering the punch it packs to charge your devices over and over, its a small price to pay.My room-mate 'borrowed' my 1st iCarrier, so I plan to buy another one soon.  I like having one or 2 extra ones as my friends are always borrowing them.You can't go wrong with this product- and the customer service is fantastic.  I have never had a question go unanswered.",5
"I originally purchased this unit for a trip I was taking to Las Vegas.  With 2 iPad&#8217;s and 2 iPhones as well as a few other devices, I knew that I needed a powerful unit to keep all of them running.  After using it during week long trip and in other situations since then, here are my impressions.Design:I like the look of the unit, since it is square not rectangular it is easier to fit into small pockets.  In fact it is small enough that it will fit in the smallest pocket of my laptop bag which can&#8217;t be said of some of the other chargers.The finish on this device is perfect.  It is matte and not shiny at all.  I have had batteries in the past that have had more of a shiny finish and they attract fingerprints which just make them annoying.  If my fingers are really greasy it will show on this unit, but it is not a constant struggle as it can be with other units.The unit is plastic, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like a cheap plastic.  I am not afraid that it will crack apart after a small drop.I do really like the fact that it comes with a cloth bag.  Since this unit is used for travel and mobility, there are times where it is thrown into a backpack, laptop and I it is nice to have it protected from scratches.Function:This unit has performed amazingly well.  I was able to charge 2 iPhones at the same time, as well as my iPad and have never had problems with not having enough power.  This really is the end goal, to have power when I need it and not have to worry about running out.  The large battery makes this unit a necessity for travel or to have when I am not around an electrical outlet.The fact that it has 2 USB ports is great as it makes this device a lot more functional that it would have been with 1 port.The micro-USB connection for input is very easy to use to charge the device and I have not had any problems with charging the unit.Overall this is a great charger for any mobile device!",5
"I received this external battery pack a few days ago and I have to say I'm not too excited about it.  I have other New Trent chargers and I highly recommend them.  However this one in my opinion is over priced for what you receive. It came completely depleted and took about 24 hours to charge.  When charging my ipad it seems like it took forever. On the power button it tells you the amount of charge the unit contains, low, mid and high, which is useful. But unless you have 20-20 vision you will need a magnifying glass to read it.  I wouldn't recommend this unit and I would return it if I wasn't so lazy.",4
Its somewhat heavy thus i normally just use it for air travel trip or to have in the car.  I wouldn't recommend it for a day pack over long period of time.It works as it is suppose to and adds backup charge capacity.,4
"Ok, so I'm a gadget freak and I bought the IMP500 in December 2011.  What can I say?  New Trent is just that good!  This is one powerful unit!  You can't charge it from your laptop like the IMP500, you need to use the wall charger, but that's ok!  I'm just very happy knowing that I'll have a way to charge my phone and iTouch when the power goes out or when I travel, etc.  I'm loving this iCruiser a lot !!!!",5
Brought this on a long trip overseas to help me recharge things while traveling. Worked quite well while charging 2 USB devices at a time and holds a great charge.,3
"I purchased this battery two days ago and with Prime and $3.99 it was overnighted.  I opened it up with a little excitement to find that there wasn't a wall charger or outlet base with this.  After I thought for a few seconds, I came to this conclusion.  If I take my ipad2 with me everywhere I go, I will always have the wall charger to charge this.  It supplies 2amps that the iCarrier IMP120D needs to charge.  I purchased this to take with me on my next vacation while I'm out cruising the streets using apps all day and trying to keep in contact with the family.  I really hope this works out for the long run as it would be great to have being able to recharge my phone around 4-5 times.  I'll update with more in a week after my trip.  Until then, this has all the potential of being a 5 star product.**Update** July 19th, 2013**I took my trip to Chicago and the IMP120D worked flawlessly.  It isn't a quick charger which can only be the down side.  Quick charging your battery can mess it up so doing the normal charge is better long term.  I charged the phone while we were standing in line for the Willis tower or while we were eating.  I used the 2.1a plug for my iPhone 4S so that it would take a little less time than the 1 amp plug.  I charged 2 phones back and forth for the entire day as we took a train out and back (2.5hrs each way) then the sight seeing for 10 hours.  By the time we were home I hooked my iPad 2 up to the iCarrier and charged it from 50% over night and it worked again to charge my phone before I left for the dunes.  This thing just keeps giving power.  I finally killed it last night (day after my trip).  It is currently charging off of my iPad charger pushing 2.1amps and it has been charging for 3 hours now.  It is close as it has been blinking the last of the three lights indicating where it is on the charge.  I hope this thing lasts because I will be using it all the time.  Especially if I'm watching a movie on the iPad or traveling anywhere.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it doesn't have a wall plug included.  I can't charge this and my ipad at the same time off the wall.  I have to do them separately because of the iCarrier not including the wall plug.  Now I haven't tried charging my ipad off of the iCarrier while it is plugged in the wall yet to fix this issue if it really is one.  Thanks for reading.",4
"I exhibit at trade shows regularly and I bought it to keep my iPad running all day. Most shows charge an arm and a leg for power and this puppy helps me avoid paying for power. Takes a bit to charge, but to be expected with it's capacity. Excellent product - going to buy more.",5
"I was given the opportunity by New Trent to review the iCarrier external battery.  I used this product with an iPhone 5, a Garmin Nuvi 50lm, and an iPad (1st gen) primarily for my geocaching hobby. This hobby uses a GPS, GPSr, and/or a smart phone to find millions of 'treasures' (caches) hidden all over the world. Because you are on the move on the time, your GPS and smartphone batteries get used up pretty fast. This is especially true when 'caching' during the day when your screen brightness needs to be turned up.IMP120 iCarrier Positive Features1. I like the way the outputs and power button are on the top of the device. That makes it easy to use when it is in your pocket or bag. (This is an improvement over the iMirror IMP60D that I also own).2.The charge status lights are more intuitive (than the iMirror IMP60D). Simple is good.3. The battery stays cool when charging.4. The ability to charge two devices at once is convenient.5. It charges iPhones and iPad fairly fast (comparable to wall charging).6. I like the wall charger, assorted cables, and pouch it came with.7. The DC plug is nice: non-polarized, horizontal design, plenty of cable, and grip strips on the sides.8. The battery has an excellent value and excellent reviews from other users.9. Nice packaging.IMP120 iCarrier Suggestions For Improvement1. The outputs need to be labeled with the volt and amp numbers. It's a pain to consult the manual to remember which output is which. Speaking of labeling, the text on the outputs could be a bit larger. My 40-year old eyes have trouble reading it.2. The shape is a bit chunky. It would fit in your pocket better if it had more of an iPhone shape (taller, skinnier, and thinner).3. It would be a lot more convenient if it had a way to attach it to a belt (belt loop or clip). See the Free Form Feedback.4. The manual needs a lot more detail.5. I don't care for the male post inside the DC input. If it gets bend, the whole device pretty much has to be thrown out. If you have a device with a female input and you bend the male jack on the cable, it is easier to replace.6. The pouch is not big enough to hold the battery, wall charger, assorted cables. I find it interesting that the iMirror IMP60D pouch can hold the battery and all of the accessories, but the IMP120 iCarrier can't.7. The box needs to be updated to include the iPhone 5.Overall, I am very impressed with the battery and the suggestions for improvement are minor. When I was first considering an external battery, the iMirror IMP60D and the IMP120 iCarrier were my top two choices. The iCarrier is now my first choice when I'm heading out the door. It has enough capacity to charge any smartphone several times over.",5
"I have been using the iCarrier for a little over two weeks now and I gotta say I am definitely happy with it.After an incident a few weeks ago where my iPhone 5 had died and had no means of charging it for several hours, I decided that I needed to definitely get an external battery. In the past, I have used an external battery case, but due to its fairly large size, I found myself taking it off when not in use. So this time around I decided to get an external pack. After reading through several reviews online, I found the New Trent iCarrier to be one of the highest reviewed ones available and has two USB ports and supports the iPad, so on a whim, I decided to try it out.First thing I noticed when unboxing it was, 'wow, this is light.' In my research, other battery packs (for less capacity) were described as being large and bulky. This thing is will easily fit in my messenger bag without adding any real extra weight.I have noticed one issue so far. I guess to prevent overcharging and using up all of your battery, it has an auto-shut off feature built in. Since iPhones use trickle charge once it reaches 100%, it usually means before I get a chance to unplug it, I am already at 99%. Not a huge issue as I can just turn it back on and doesn't really affect performance. In fact, this could be a selling point for some people.Either way, this has proved to be a great external battery so far. I will update after further use.",5
"The slim design is great for a pack that gives me at least 4 full charges of my S3. I like the high-mid-low power switch as well. This pack is extremely easy to operate, doesn't weigh much and is a great deal considering New Trent's reputation. I use this pack on my weekly travel as a consultant. I'm planning to get another pack as a backup for my wife to keep in the car for her phone (much quicker than a 12v car charge) and my kid's devices.",5
"I bought this because my iphone 4s is sucking more battery life than i am use to in the iphone line. I also have an iphone 4 , and this battery back is the answer. Don't think twice just buy it, it will charge your phones on the go for a week without having to plug it in. I recharge it once a week and it charges all my apple products, including the ipad 2. This is a must buy if you need mobility charging.",5
"this battery works good...  but...  you have to tote around another piece of equipment-a charger...  it's the same type of charger as a laptop charger, just a shorter cord...  anyway...i'm bailing on this charger because it's a hassle carrying around more cords/adaptors and weight...",3
"For the price this isn't bad.  I thought it would work like the others, where the device uses the battery pack before its own internal battery, but this is not the case.  This battery pack is just good for charging and not when your ipad or whatever is in use.  I had issues with mine turning on.  Sometimes I cannot get it to turn on without first plugging it into an AC adapter to jump start it.  This is when it is fully charged too.  I don't know what is up with that.  I may end up returning it if the problem persists.",2
"I bought this product before I went to hot weather training. I had a morphie power pack, but it didn't hold enough charge to fully power my iPhone.So I looked online for the biggest power charger I could find, for a DECENT price. After TONS of searching, I ended up finding the iCarrier, and bought it.I was NOT disappointed.Not only did this thing have enough charge for my iPhone, but I was able to charge my entire squad's phone for a week! What surprised me even more was thefact that even in 120 degree heat, the battery life was not affected, as well as how fast it charged my iPhone!And for the size, it is a bit big for carrying around for everyday use, but for the hiker, outdoorsman, military personnel, and people willing to carry it around, it does the job, and MUCH MUCH more!",5
"I've had this for about 2 weeks and so far it's been working great. This is the 5th product from New Trent that I've added to my collection (along with purchasing theNew Trent Dual high-speed USB port car charger(NT88C)at the same time).I like the fact that I can charge both my Android phone (Samsung Droid Charge) and another phone or mp3 player or Samsung Galaxy Tablet in the second usb port at the same time.It seems to charge my Samsung Galaxy Tablet pretty fast (though it needs to use the extra Samsung Tab cable that New Trent provided along with the tablet's own cable in order to charge). I also own both theNew Trent iTorch IMP52D 5200mAh External Battery Chargerand theNew Trent NT52D/NT-5200 iDual 5200mAh 1A/0.5A Dual USB Ports External Battery Pack. Since this is 12000mAH compared to the other's 52000mAH, it just seems to hold more power and charge faster.But since it holds more power, it is also much more heavier and bulkier than both the iTorch and the iDual. It is substantially built and looks high quality and has a nice LED light to indicate it's on and charging and how much charge is left. I believe it's also 'smart' enough to turn off once the phone/tablet is fully charged.One of the cons is that it needs a separate AC charger to charge the iCarrier. (Wherease you can just use the microUSB adapter cable from the iTorch or iDual and plug into your phone/tablet's USB charger. This makes an extra adapter to carry. Plus, I cannot just recharge it with my USB car adapter like I can with the iTorch and iDual.) But at least it comes in a nice velvet pouch that can hold the iCarrier and all of its cables together.Due to it's heavy size and bulkiness and extra cables, I tend to only bring it when I know I'm going to be away on a trip or will need to be charging multiple devices frequently. For example, this this past weekend when I went on a 2 1/2 hr road trip to Palm Desert for a volleyball tournament. I was great to have on the car ride since I was sitting in the back and other people needed the car charger slots. At the tournament, there weren't many available convenient outlets and I wanted to keep my phone and tablet hidden in my bag (away from potential theft) and my iCarrier kept both juiced up at all times.I love all my New Trent products and feel that I have great options for backup batteries:For everyday, going out... I love taking the iTorch with me since it's sleek, light, and fits in my purse and has extra functions (flashlight and laser pointer).I keep the iDual in my work/laptop bag or take with me when I might need to also recharge my tablet.For longer road trips or where I know I'll need lots of power and frequent charging, I take the iCarrier in my backpack.And I always have my dual high-speed USB port car charger in my car to charge multiple devices while driving.I'm basically covered and hope to never have worry about a dying phone every again!",5
This charger has been used more by my children than me.  They use it to charge their ipods when we are on the road. It's small enough to take with you and has plenty of power to fully charge my iphone 5 and my children's ipods before being recharged itself.,5
Super. It charge my iPad Mini Retina and my iPhone 5 at the same time at full charge and still have charge for some extra.,5
"Works great and is very portable, easily fits in my pc bag,  use it for  charging both Android and iPhone",4
"I had a different backup battery pack for my phone that still works well, but after upgrading to a new phone, and starting to carry a tablet, I started looking for a battery pack with higher output and capacity. This battery pack fit my needs very well. It is a bit on the thick side, but since it has a 12000mAh capacity, I kind of expected that. With this battery, I can charge my PlayBook, Nexus 7 tablet, and my phone (two at a time). It's nice to not worry about running out of power when out and about. :)",5
"Very powerful that charges my iphone at least 4 times. Lightweight and portable. The only con I had was the power button, where you have to hold the button in order to turn on. It was a bit puzzling at first but got used to it after using it often. Overall, the product was as advertised and would recommend to people who are going to long road trips or as a back up extended battery during emergency situations.",5
"Great device no doubt about it its the best external battery on the market. I have a iphone and I use it a lot my phone dies at least 2 times a day this battery was just great was able to always have my phone charged. Its great how it has a led light that indicates how much battery life it has left. Also its great that it has two usb ports for charging two devices at once. Its a great looking device, its small, even when using the product while charging other phones or its self it does not get hot like most devices. Its also great how it comes with a little bad that you can put the device. In the little bag I can fit up too two cords which is good this way you always have easy access to them. I would recommend this product for anyone thats in school travels a lot of just is to lazy to plug there phone into an outlet.",5
"I can't say enough good things about New Trent stuff - this external battery is no different - holds many phone recharges (great for long trips) and it's small enough for me to keep in my purse so that I can always plug my phone in on the go. It has saved me (and my friends) many a time. After your phone has 100% charge, it even shuts itself off so it doesn't waste its battery. Just amazing product!",5
"I'm the type of person that feels the need to do a ton of research beforemaking a purchase, so I did a lot of narrowing down to get to this device.The good news is, I've been completely happy with my purchase. I'm a momof four boys who are heavily into sports, plus a business owner to boot (ieI use my phone a lot), so I knew I needed a charger that would have a largecapacity. I don't have time to mess with something that can only chargeone device at once, or that holds a small charge, or that has to be chargedevery day. This charger fit the bill. It's small enough to carry in mypurse without it getting in the way, and I take it with me where ever Igo. I use it about 5 days a week, to charge my family's iphones, iPods, oriPad. I charge the battery pack about once a week. If your family has abunch of devices, you'll be glad you have this! I find that it chargesiPhones and iPods quickly. I take mine nightly to sporting events, andfind myself often offering to charge someone else's phone. It's alsofabulous for vacation spots like Disney, where finding a plug isn't reallyan option. The ability to charge more than one device at a time is alife-saver for someone like me; it eliminates kids fighting over whose devicegets to charge next!If you're a single person looking for an occasional small charge, thisisn't the battery pack for you. You're better off with something you canslip in your pocket. But if you're a superwoman, multi-tasking,carpool-running, PTA-helping mom on the go, this is the device you'relooking for. You've already got a purse or a diaper bag with youconstantly, so just add this to the pile of crayons and snacks, and you'llbe one happy mama!Overall, it's a great device, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",5
"Overall, this is probably my favorite New Trent product. It's simple, easy  to use, and does exactly what I want it to do. This device is able to charge my iPhone, iPad, or other USB devices multiple times, and still is able to fit all this power in very small product relative to its output. My biggest complaint on this device is based on the charger. This device requires a unique charging cable, and this adds another cable I'm forced to travel with. I would have liked it you could have used a simple micro USB, mini USB, or other device cable to charge this device. Lastly, I do enjoy the option to charge USB devices, even though it drastically slows the charging process. However, it's more than sufficient for two smartphones.I would rate this product a 4.5/5, and the only con being the charging  cable.",5
"I've been using the IMP120D for the last week and it has let me stop worrying about conserving power on my devices.  For charging a tablet like an iPad or android device, there are not many portable chargers that will output 2 amps.  This device has both a 2amp and a 1amp charger so I can charge both phone and tablet at same time.  For these portable chargers, higher capacity is better and 12000 mAh is a lot bigger than any of the others I have tried.  Would not hesitate to recommend this awesome charger.",5
"This battery is BIG, but it's fine if you're looking for something to keep you charged up on the road or long flight...or during power outtages, like after hurricanes. The power supply lasts HOURS longer than most other iPhone external batteries, plus it's a multi-device charger.The included accessories and adapters are many, BUT it's missing the ONE MUST HAVE adapter! It's missing the adapter that will fit iPhones; which renders this battery useless without using your original iPhone cord...which doesn't roll up to travel well. I find this highly irritating.If you market this product for use with iPhones, then include the proper accessory for it.",3
"After extensive reviews and even purchasing a different item to charge my IPad 3rd Generation, I found the New Trend iCruiser IMP 1000.  This product absolutely meets and exceeds all the positive comments made concerning the item.  The nice thing about the battery pack is that it works with ALL the electronic devices that I have instead of a separate charger for each item.  It comes with a bag that keeps everything together so you don't misplace anything.I have used this product to charge my new IPad.  The IPad was down to within 20% of its charge and I used this to recharge the device.  Although it took quite a while (several hours) to recharge the IPad (and we know the new IPad is a battery hog), that is due to the device and not the iCruiser.  I have also used it to charge my Android and other devices which it recharged rapidly.CONSThe only negative I could have would be the weight.  Although you can drop it in your purse and carry it wherever you go, it is heavy.  But that is a small price to pay to KNOW you have the charging power whenever you need it.Would I recommend this to a friend - ABSOLUTELY.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it an 11.",5
I would recommend this to anyone who is on the go and needs to charge their mobile deices. It has two usb ports so you can charge two things at once. The only bad things about it that it takes a good amount of time to charge and its a little bulky.,4
"My techie son gave this to me because my iphone4S always seems to need to be recharged at the least convenient times. This provides a rapid charge with no stress and it supports all the apple products I own. It is a little bulkier than I'd like, but it does a super job. My only advice is to read the instructions which offer a lot of practical advice regarding care and operation.",5
"*Disclosure: I was contacted by New Trent and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of reviewing it.*Test devices:Google Nexus 7Kindle Fire HD 7'HTC OneSamsung Galaxy NexusHTC EVO 4G LTESatechi Touch USB LED LampSatechi BT Touch Portable Bluetooth SpeakerSatechi ST-K100 Bluetooth KeyboardThe iCarrier is just small enough to fit in the palm of my hand, made of a stout feeling plastic shell.  The shell is smooth to the touch, with an eggshell like semi-gloss finish.  Though not glossy, it still picked up fingerprints somewhat easily.  The blue LEDs used to indicate the unit is on or charging are a bit too faint for my liking, especially compared to those of theSendy Portable Battery Charger with built-in Flashlightthat I recently reviewed.  I have to really get up close to see if the LEDS are glowing like they should.  No AC charger is included here, but I was able to use AC->USB chargers from HTC, Asus, and Samsung without a problem.  The manual indicates it takes about 10 hours to give this puppy a full charge, and this is consistent with the for or 5 recharge cycles I went through while testing this unit.  Straight up, I tested this out with a lot more devices than listed above, and so far nothing hasn't worked with it.  When using the 2A port, each device charged at the same rate as if I'd been using a 2A AC adapter.  When two devices were plugged in at the same time, the charge rate for the 2A port didn't change, with both devices charging up at the rate expected for a 2A and 1A port.  On a full charge, I was able to use the iCarrier to recharge three or four devices before the iCarrier would signal it needed a recharge of its own.  I never did figure just how long the lamp would run on a full charge, but I'd be willing to take it and the iCarrier on a weekend camping trip without expecting to have run out of juice.  Overall, it's an excellent device to have around, and I've found myself using it most when I've forgotten to give my phone a refill and won't be near a AC outlet for some while.",4
I am about to just buy a bunch of them and sell them out of my bag for 100 bucks... People have already offered to buy it from me but I usually already need it since my phone or tab is dead...,5
"Never actually work.  I never got the chance to use it until tonight and I *really* needed it to.Turns on for about 20 seconds and then powers off.  It's fully charged, and for that 20 seconds it is charging what ever is attached to it, but it's useless if I need to constantly power it back on.I'm glad I found this out now as my company was going to buy 50 or so chargers.  I'll know not to get this one.",1
"The device works as advertised. I use it to &#34;throw&#34; a charge on my iPad 4, Galaxy Note 3 (previously S4) smartphone, accessories along with my son's iPhone and mobile hotspots. It works as designed and lasts a long time.Two gripes:Gripe 1) I don't understand why they could not label the output ports with clear language. Is it that hard? The outputs are labeled &#34;Output 1&#34; and &#34;Output 2.&#34; NO WHERE on their product NOR in their manual does it state that the two output ports actually output at different levels. Had I not come across an old photo of a previous gen unit, I never would know that &#34;Output 1&#34; output = 1 Amp, and &#34;Output 2&#34; output = 2 Amps. This is good info to know when you're trying to charge a large device like an iPad.Gripe 2) The power-on button takes almost zero pressure for about a millisecond to power the unit on. To power off you have to press and hold the power button for a few seconds. It's too easy to accidentally bump the unit &#34;on&#34; and thus is drains while it's bouncing around in your backpack, bag or car.",4
"This baby has ample power to charge your iPhone, ipad, or both.Yes, it weighs a bit more, but I'm not held back by a few extra ounces.Rather, I'd prefer to get a full charge when I need it.At first, the only confusing thing was holding the power button on to turn it on, or to put it to sleep.I wasn't used to that. (I tried o charge it when it was &#34;off&#34; which didn't work.Now I realize that's what saves it from losing power. Go figure!So to charge it, turn it on.To charge your devices, also turn it on.If its turned off, when you try to charge it, it will not charge.Besides that's its great!",5
This is exactly what I was looking for to charge both my tablet and my cell phone at the same time. The customer service of this company is friendly and top notch. They strive for excellent customer service and try their best to resolve issues quickly.,5
"I just received the 1200 MAh unit (IMP120D).  Though I was warned by other reviewers (and, there are some good reviews on this product), this is really large and weighty.  The largest issue for me is having to carry another proprietary AC charging device around with me.  I would prefer it being charged via a USB AC adapter or lighter device so I don't have to carry another unit.  The AC charger is a 5V, 2 amp unit which doesn't help me at all with my other devices.  A 2 amp AC charger with a USB input would have been ideal.Why is it that everyone has to build electronic devices with proprietary input ports, amps and voltage levels.  In fact, I would not have minded if they said, 'No AC adapter needed, simply use your existing iPad or USB charger'.The charge rate seems a bit slow.  My iPad has been idle and charging for over 4 hours and is only at 87%.  I'll have to see how this works over the next week.Appears to be a great device, a bit weak on the execution of the design.  A couple of tweaks and it would be much better and more portable.UPDATE:  12/17/2012Okay, I had to come back and update this reveiw.  After a couple of trips, I think this unit will serve my needs.  I still wish that it would use a USB charger rather than the proprietary one that is required.  However, it charged phone twice, and iPad 2 times.  I don't know what to do with my spare airport time formerly used roaming around for a 110v AC plug.It is very much worth it if you travel a lot and find yourself constantly looking for an outlet.",5
I was interested in this product due to the sleek design and I ended up being very impressed by the ability to carry around with me in my pocket and the comes in and out very easily.  I carry the battery in my left pocket and my phone and right with a charge cable connecting the two.  This allows a very non cumbersome fell yet keeps my phone charged all day.,5
"I bought this item a week ago and I am very happy with my purchase!  After charging it up, I've been taking it everywhere I go.  It is small enough to fit in any bag, and its sleek design allows it to lay flat in some pockets.  After days of periodic use, all the indicator lights are still up, indicating a high level of charge.  The only issue I see is that the included bag is only big enough to hold the device and maybe one cord.  I use the iCarrier for both my smart phone and an iPad, so a bit of extra space in the bag would be nice.  Keep in mind that this device charges off of micro usb, and a wall charger is not included.  I thought this odd until I realized that most phones and other devices come with micro usb chargers, and to add another wire to the collection could continue to clutter my drawers.  Overall, 5 stars, great product.  I would definitely recommend it!",5
"I had once been timid of taking photos and videos while traveling, afraid my battery would run out before I could have a chance to charge again.  I now now feel free to use my phone as much as possible, and know that I have the iCruiser IMP120D to keep me, my wife, and other friends going!  i have yet to be able to run the IMP120D completely empty in one day, even with multiple using it multiple times in a day.  The only complaint is that you need the external charger to re-charge the IMP120D.  It would be nice if it was somehow integrated, should a random opportunity arrise to charge it.  If you travel a lot, this is a must-have.",5
"I have used this mostly on trips or where AC was not readily available.  It works great with my iPad which is what I bought it for.  I would have given it 5 stars if it would also work with my iPhone 4, but I understand now there is a special cord needed.  It is a little large but for what I needed it for it works great.",4
"I bount this backup batter for my phone (Nokia) and my iPad. I'll try to keep this review short and to the point.The size and shape is ideal. I was positively surprised about it. It was smaller and lighter than I expected based on the large capacity.The capacity is impressive!The operation is straight forward, only one button to turn it on. It is annoying that I have to hold the button for 2 seconds to turn it on. My previous backup battery had no button at all and would turn itself on automatically when I connected it to my phone and start charging.Output current is limited to 1 Amp. This is my biggest complaint. While this is enough for phones, it's only half of what the iPad would accept. recharging the iPad takes twice as long as the original charger and makes it less useful. A charge time of 8 hours isn't practical.Recharging of the device itself (with the supplied charger) takes about 5 hours which is pretty long.Overall I like it and it does the job. I wish they would clearly state that it does not provide the full charge current for the iPad.Edit 3/21/2011: After using it for some time now I'm still very happy with it. I use it for both my iPad and iPhone. The most positive thing is really the convenience of using it as a charger and never having to worry about finding a wall outlet. I'm almost not using my normal wall chargers any more, using this one is just so much more convenient?",4
"This battery pack is perfect! My sister forgot her phone charger when she came to visit. I whipped out the IMP1000 and plugged in her phone. A few hours later, her phone was at 100%. Needless to say, both of us were very impressed. I charged her phone several times during the visit and the IMP1000 still showed 3/3 bars for charge. Awesome product, definitely glad I purchased it.  Highly recommended.",5
Products works as described.  the iCarrier charges overnight.  I can then charge my Note2 at least twice.  Charging the Note2 takes a reasonable amount of time..... I think faster than using a 9volt usb charger in my car.  The LED indicators tell you how much juice in the battery and indicate when unit is on and charging the mobile device.  I recommend it.,4
"12000mAh capacity which is very nice for tablet users, especially the Output #2 which outputs 2A of current for faster charging than the Output #1 which outputs 1A of current.  Many factory wall chargers that come with the tablet (e.g. iPad) also output at 2A-2.1A so you can expect this IMP120D will charge your tablet just as fast as the factory wall charger will do.  You can also take advantage of its dual-port feature to charge two devices simultaneously.  Note that, most cell phones won't be benefited by the 2A Output #2 because the circuitry of the phone usually limits the current draw at 1A.I do not feel too much heat during charging or discharging so given the high capacity and the 2A output it feels very safe to be used.Oleophobic and matte surface which means it stays clean from fingerprints or dirt, and very easy to clean.This batt pack has to be charged by the bundled power adapter (or other universal AC chargers with same spec), which means one more thing to carry with you, unless you think one full charge will satisfy all your need.  The weight is about 2x smartphones or 1/2 pound, which is about right for this kind of capacity.The recharge time is no joke.  From 0% to 100% would take you 8-10 hours due to the high capacity.  The battery level indicator LED stays mostly (5+ hours) at the 2nd LED which makes me think, 'has it been fully charged yet??'  Just be patient and the 3rd LED will eventually come to a solid light, indicating the batt pack is at 100%.Other suggestions:1. Prefer longer timeout for auto shut down.  Reason is, when the device (phone or tablet or etc) is nearly fully charged, the drawn current approaches to a minimal value such that the batt pack thinks the device is no longer connected to it, and it starts to timeout for auto shut down.  Sometimes the batt pack shuts down before the device gets back to 100% charged.2. Prefer more than 3 LEDs for battery level indicator.  Many times the indicator has 2 LEDs on and I have no idea if the batt pack is at 34% full or at 66% full.  The other product, IMP52D, has 5200mAh (slightly less than half of this IMP12D's capacity) but has 4 LEDs.3. Love to see if it also has a backup charging port with USB/microUSB connectivity such that the power adapter is not needed, even though I understanding charging this high capacity batt pack with, such as, 500mA USB port would take much longer to complete.",4
"Becca from My Crazy Good Life recommended this charger. I asked on twitter and the company told me which one to purchase - I was impressed by that. This will charge my iphone 4s and my Nook HD. It is small enough to fit in my purse so I usually carry it with me all the time.When we spent a week in a cabin with NO electricity, this charger saved me so I could read on my nook as well as keep my constantly dying iphone charged.During football season when we spent hours away from home, this charger again saved the day to keep my phone charged to keep taking photos and send out texts with updates.When we had a power outage, this charger again saved the day keeping my phone charged and more than that, keeping me worry free.I appreciate how it turns itself off when the device is charged.I tell everyone they should purchase this charger or one from this company that is like it.  I even posted it on my blog as a football mom survival kit item.  Great product!",5
"This is a terrific product and I feel very comfortable giving it a 5 star rating.I would like to have it a little smaller to make it easier to carry but it is still small enough to carry in a pocket or backpack compartment.  I was really impressed with he amount of 'power' it has.  On a single charge of the IMP 120D I recharged my iPhone 4 times, my Kindle Fire once and my wife's iPhone5 twice.I would like to have a more detailed user's manual but the device it simple to use so I was able to figure it out quickly.I think this device will prove to be a 'must have' for anyone doing things outdoors. Campers, bikers, hikers, etc will find it be an important addition to their gear.I also think it would be a great item to have in the event of a power outage or other emergency.  Having back-up power for your phone, notebook or i Pad could prove to very very important.This is a quality product and I will use it often.",5
"Works as advertised. I wish that the carrying pouch is larger so that it can carry the charger and the USB cables. In the current configuration, the pouch literally can only cary the battery itself.",5
Love the 2 USB ports.  Love not having to be tied to an outlet to charge.  The 2A port is awesome.  Well worth the investment!,5
"Gadget girl here to review the IMP1000 battery pack. I have a new iPad and and iPhone 5, and I am always looking for ways to keep my devices powered up, sans an electrical outlet. I own 3 New Trent portable batteries because frankly, they make excellent products. This IMP1000 is my second battery I purchased from them, and I am impressed with its longevity. I charge it overnight, and this will last for days! I plug my iPhone in when the battery drops to about 50%, and it will be back up to 100% in 30 min or less.The pack is solid and surprisingly, not that heavy. I wouldn't slip it into my back pocket, but it works nicely in a small bag or purse. (ladies!) I have also used this with my new iPad, but I have since purchased a separate battery for it.If you need long lasting, portable power for your iPhone or iPad, this is it.",5
"It's a great device, pretty small and powerful. BUT two things: it has only one power port (compared to five on the power sociopath, iSound). And mine (iTrent) broke almost immediately, though I managed to fix it. I was horrified to see the light no longer turning on, after I barely dropped it on a wooden floor.I pryed it open with a butter knife and pushed a plug back into place inside. It would have gone sometime.. any vibration would've finished the job. So this is possibly unique to the one I received. If not, I recommend the the iSound. It's about two inches longer than iTrent, and a little thinner. So far, the iSound has given some really great battery times, though one reviewer complained that his iSound almost burned his house down while sitting idle in a drawer.",2
"While I haven't had the chance to fully test the capacity of this device, I've been very pleased with the amount of extra power I've gotten out of it. The charger is very compact, albeit a little heavy, but that is to be expected for having so much charge. While this model also lacks the convenience of some other smaller packs that can be charged using USB, I think the use of a separate higher current adapter makes sense for such a high capacity device.In terms of aesthetics, while the IMP120D isn't as sleek as some other products with chrome trim and mirror finishes, I personally prefer the more utilitarian matte black on display here.",5
"The bottom line on the New Trent battery is this: it works. In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's large, effective, versatile and well designed. It's by far the largest external battery that I've come across in terms of capacity (with whopping 12,000 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than some of its larger near-competitors.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 4S,iPhone 3G,Kindle Keyboard,Mobee Magic Bar,Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the first generationiPad (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged New Trent battery. I was also able to charge my iPad to completely, and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around. If there was an easy way of connecting this battery to an ultrabook I would not be surprised if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as well.The battery comes with an AC charger, micro USB cable, Galaxy Tab converter cable, AC - DC wall charger (5V @ 2A), soft pouch and a user manual. The pouch is a very convenient way of keeping your charger, battery, and cables together while traveling.This New Trent battery is also beautifully designed. You would not be ashamed of being spotted with this battery at a trendy tech conference. The battery is very easy to use and operate, and overall vey intuitively designed.I am very pleased and impressed with this rechargeable external battery. It is effective, portable, and very affordable. I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot or uses their gadgets on the go all the time. It can even be carried around in your messenger bag during your daily commute - it will not add that much extra weight.***** Review product provided by the manufacturer. *****",5
"I carry a lot of power hungry devices and was looking for a replacement for a battery pack that bricked on me.  Since I already had aNew Trent iGeek IMP99D 9900mAh External Battery Pack and Charger for 'The new iPad' the 3rd Gen ipad, iPad2, iPhone 4S 4 3Gs 3G, iPod Touch (1G to 5G), Android (Samsung Galaxy Note S S2, HTC Sensation EVO Thunderbolt, LG Optimus V), Blackberry (Bold cur...which I really like, I decided to pair it with the iCarrier IMP120D.  I like to have two heavy duty chargers so I can 'tag team' them if needed.  While I originally bought battery chargers for travel, I find that I use them a lot at home when one of my devices goes low on charge while I am using it.My most power hungry devices are an iPad 3rd Generation and an HTC EVO View 4G.  I've read that the new iPad uses power faster than it can be supplied, but I found that the iCarrier (like the iGeek) can extend your usage time and will add charge if you are just doing simple tasks like reading mail, web browsing, checking iMDB during a movie, etc.  The HTC on the other hand will only charge during use with the provided power cord.  However, it can be charged from the battery pack while off.When I received the iCarrier, it had two of the three lights charged.  I charged it until the third light came on, then tried it out with my iPad.  It drained almost immediately.  I found out from New Trent support that you should drain the battery completely and then charge it fully before the first use.  This brings the lights in sync with the actual battery level.  I did this and it has been working fine since.  I charged my iPad 3 from 55% to 100% and the battery indicators just went from three lights to two.  I then used it to charge the HTC.  It charged it from 14% to 62% with the remainder of the battery.I have not been using the cables provided with either the iCarrier or the iGeek.  It seems like any cable will work.The iCarrier is slightly larger and heavier than the iGeek, which is to be expected due to the additional capacity.  It also has a hard , shiny shell vs the matte, rubbery shell of the iGeek.  I believe that New Trent used feedback from the iGeek product when designing the iCarrier since the power lights are smaller and dimmer.  The power button is also recessed.  I find the markings on the USB ports easier to read on the iCarrier.The iCarrier is much smaller than the charger I replaced.  It is very easy to carry both New Trent products in a backpack or other place where it can be handy when needed.I've been very happy with the iGeek for a year now, and it looks like the iCarrier will give me the same level of expected service.",4
"Let's be honest here. Smart phone battery life sucks. We shouldn't have to compromise great hardware for poor battery life. That's why I decided to get this Trent iCarrier. This thing can charge my phone 7 or 8 times over and I don't have to be tied to a wall outlet. I used to be afraid to play mobile games on my iPhone when I wasn't home because I didn't want to kill my battery in case I needed to make a call. I'm in theater so when I pull my phone off the plug in the morning. I got the entire school day, then I got very long rehearsals, and sometimes I have youth group. I don't got much time to leave my phone in an outlet in between. But this thing is super light and portable so I can just leave it plugged into my iPhone in my backpack and let it charge. Or depending on what I'm wearing I can put it in my cargo shorts and still have my phone on me. I'm so glad I bought this.",5
"I've used this product for about a year. I don't use it daily, but probably once a week I use it when my iPhone is slow and I'm not near a charger. It has worked beautifully. I recharge the charger about once a month, and it still appears to retain its charge and charge my iPhone backup quickly. I've used it to charge up my family's iPhones as well. I was able to charge three or four iPhones using this product before I needed to recharge it. It gives me great peace of mind to know that it is in my briefcase or knapsack, and that I can just reach in and have my phone charged. It's also a nice size for a briefcase or knapsack, or putting in my pocket with my iPhone.",5
I went backpacking with a friend and we had iPhones. We turned off the data on our phones and used them solely as &#34;dumbphones&#34; to elongate the battery life as much as possible. We kept them charged the entire week without needing to top off anywhere else. Thoroughly recommend.,5
"Just received the IMP 1000 so a few first impressions.  Like others have written, it's a pretty sleek but weighty battery pack.  Although it would be easier to carry if it was more rectangular than square; and its slippery plastic shell definitely needs a padded case for protection.  Always good to have the included extra plug adapters to add to my growing collection.  But a question for you geeks: is there any reason I can't charge this thing with the small solar panels that I have for other brands of battery packs?",4
"This is an awesome little gadget!  I have an iPhone 5, which doesn't have the best battery life.  On a normal day I barely have any charge left by night time when I charge my phone, and if I happen to use it for things other than checking emails and Facebook during the day then I run out of juice.  I carry this in my purse, and when I start running low on power just plug in the USB cable and charge.  It charges fairly quickly, and the item itself holds a charge for quite a long time.  I haven't timed how long, but I've gone a few weeks with it in my purse and was still able to connect my friend's phone to it for a quick charge.  The best part is you can charge two items at once, so as long as you have different cables with you you and a friend can simultaneously charge phones.  I've also used it to charge my iPad along with my iPhone and it had no problems whatsoever.  I'm sure as an entrepreneur you can offer to charge for a price in places where there is no electricity available as well.",5
"I've used external batteries for over 7 years to charge my devices while traveling.  I'm a consultant so am traveling at least 80% of the time.  I leave in my briefcase and plug in my phone or tablet while in meetings, at trade shows, etc.  Much better for me than plugging making my phone fat and bulky with a batter/case combo.I've been using a Zagg sparq for a number of years.  Zagg has had treated me well with their Sparq, replacing under warranty once without a fuss when the prongs of the plug broke off.  When a colleague showed me his New Trent iCarrier and the amp hours it sported I couldn't believe it.  I hadn't heard of New Trent.This battery arrived last week very quickly due to Amazon efficiencies.  This battery matches the dimensions of my Zagg Sparq so it's a one for one swap out in my briefcase.  I use my iPad outlet plug to charge this battery as it doesn't come with a charger or built in plug like the Zagg.  I appreciate the little bag it comes with as it's handy to keep the micro usb cable it comes with in there.  I leave the charging ports facing out so I never have to take out of the bag.With a week's use, or about 4 full charges of my iPhone, it still hasn't drained!  Love it.",5
"Great backup battery with a compact size and good power capacity.  I also like the ability to charge two devices at the same time.  Will come in handy while traveling.Since I like to reduce the amount of charging blocks I take on vacation, I was able to purchase a USB to 5.5/2.5mm Barrel Connector Jack DC Power Cable on eBay.  It works great charging the IMP120D using my iPad USB charging block.",5
"Its just great, it charges my ipad 2 and my smartphone, i really recommend it!, it can hold the charge over two weeks and still with juice on it, if you are not shure if you need this....trust me you will, i have to travel alot and this will not let me down in any situation",5
"After I got my IMP120D about a week ago, I went right ahead and charged it to use the next day. I purposely kept my phone on battery until it got low. It charged pretty fast and is useful for a quick charge. I still had a lot of charge left in the device after I finished charging my phone, which is nice.The product holds quite a large charge while being still compact. Although it is fine to carry in a bag, I found it a bit worrying to handle with my hands- the outer material is a bit prone to slipping, so I was worrying I would drop this decently heavy device.However, it's really nice to have for a family, as it can charge two devices at once (could be better if it could charge 3 or more!). I can be charging my phone, while my brother can be charging his tablet. Great for long plane rides. Overall it's a nice product but only if you really need the large charge.",4
"After returning the Thunderbolt for poor battery life, I purchased the Samsung Charge. It was marginally better but still unable to make it through a day of heavy use - enter the IMP1000. It can recharge the the Samsung several times, and can also power the phone while it is recharging itself. While it is a bit too big to easily carry in your pocket, it fit easily in your briefcase, backpack or day bag.The battery itself feels solid and well made. It comes with interchangeable tips for different phones/devices and has its own charger.Lastly, the seller is amazing. I order the product on Saturday and received it on Tuesday. Borrowing a phrase from American Express...'don't leave home without it.'",5
"This unit is awesome... I have two ipads, an iphone and an ipod touch and they can all get charged from dead to full charge with this unit, from one full charge!  Plug it in overnight and you are ready to go (they suggest 7 hours of initial charge).  The size and weight is small enough to quite easily carry it in my camera case as that goes everywhere with me as does at least one ipad and the iphone. Well worth the money for this one!",5
"Pros: Holds a great amount of charge, can continually charge my phone while driving or eating in between work, school, and home.  I can just store it in my car so its available when I'm on the go. Very useful while traveling; I recently took it with me to a conference so that I could keep my phone charged all day long.Cons: a bit bulky (weight isn't too bad, but takes up a decent amount of space), making it tricky to fit into a pocket to charge my phone while walking around.  USB connection seems a tad loose physically (jiggles around a little bit more than other USB ports), and occassional buzzing sound while charging made me nervous initially.",5
"One of the few external battery packs that has the capacity to charge numerous devices and provide the quality, features and ease of use. This is my first New Trent device and after carefully researching other devices and after reading reviews of this unit, I purchased the unit without hesitation. Perfect size for portability, easy to use and has the power to charge all my smart phones and the power hungry iPad. Excellent design and build quality. Will come in handy the next time I am without power.",5
"The product I have is well worth what I paid for it and its a 5. It charges faster then any car charger I have had and saves my butt when I'm not near car or power source. The first day it was used I believe we charged a total of 8 smart phones that were either half or lower on battery and it was on low by the time the night ended. I currently own a iPhone 4S, iPhone 3GS x2, two iPod touches 2nd and 3rd generation. A kindle fire, and a kindle 3G and I have used it to charge all of them. If your away from power sources a lot I recommend this for any one that needs a quick charge",5
"I work over-seas 6 months out the year and constantly in flight. This product has kept my iPad2 working for me to watch movies/TV Shows while traveling. I have not had this product long, but So far, So good, I like it.",4
"Took forever to charge my ipad to 50%. I had the device shut off and it took about 6 hours to get the charge.  I wish it could be quicker. The other problem I have is it needs a separate charger, I wish it was chargeable via a USB cord.",3
New Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery is perfect for my devices. When I travel it is extremely necesary.,5
"I wanted to buy this for my mom for the longest time but, the price was $54 and I couldn't afford it.As luck would have it, a few days later it dropped to $39.99 and I JUMPED at the chance to get it.So far just tried it out on my mom's iphone and it worked like a charm but, looking forward to having her travel with it.It is quite portable. Smaller than most of the other 12000mah battery chargers on the market and quite durable.I'm happy I bought it. I totally recommend this battery to anyone looking for a truly &#34;PORTABLE&#34; portable charger.",5
"Rather than buy one of those expensive gadget charging backpacks I bought this. I move it around from bag to bag as needed. The capacity is great, especially when traveling. It takes a long time to fully charge but that's to be expected with a battery of this magnitude.",4
"I'm going to jump on the bandwagon here with another 5 star review of the New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 11000mAh battery pack.  It's really as good as everyone says.  I bought it mainly to charge myMotorola Triumph Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile), which has horrible battery life, but I also have other assorted devices that need to stay charged and this battery pack is working great with all of them.  After the initial 10-12 hour charge last week, I haven't recharged the New Trent iCruiser at all, but I've used it to charge my Motorola Triumph every night and sometimes to keep it charged up during the day.  I've also used it on myStriiv: Personal Trainer in Your Pocketand theKindle Touch 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6' E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers.  It's been at least 5 days and it hasn't quit yet and shows no signs of needing a recharge yet.  I can't wait to take this on vacation with me.  No more worrying about keeping my devices charged while I'm away.  This is a must-have for anyone with devices that charge via USB.",5
"This product works exactly as was advertised. It charges my phones/tablets in AC mode. If I had to purchase one again I would probably get one that can charge with USB. This model only charges with the included AC adapter, and frankly I could do without another power cable to worry about.",4
"I had my doubts about ordering this (so many chargers, so little juice time) but I'm so happy that I did.  It is a little bulky but I guess it needs to be for the amount of power it has to charge things up. It charges everything you throw at it - quickly, and I've never had it run out.  I've left it sitting for a couple of months, needed to use it and it has lots of charging power. I'd recommend it without any hesitation.  It's great value for the product that you receive.  I'm very impressed.",5
"I bought this at least 2 years ago, I think.  It does keep my phones charged.  In fact, I am able to charge my iPhone at least 5 times when it was brand new, and after so many usage, I can still get at least 3 full charges to my iPhone.  I also accidentally got it wet in the rain while in Peru.  I had forgotten that I had stuffed it in bottom of my day pack and it rained hard that day.  I was upset at first because I thought it was permanently damaged, but my wife made me try using hair dryer and dry to keep the battery dry some how, and when it seemed dry enough, it was working properly again.",5
The device is really nice and compact and appears fairly sturdy. I have only used it for two weeks and it seams to be able to charge both of my phones for two nights in a row.There few minor things I would like to see improved are to have it in a rectangular vs. sqare shape. I think I'll be better able to fit it in my gear. Also I would like to have a micro USB cable coming out of it so I don't have to carry extra cable.Last but not least if comes with bulky charger so if you want to recharge it while travelling you need to carry it. For me that's not an issue since I get enough charge to not have to carry the charger.,4
"I ordered the New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 11000 mAh external battery pack so that I can charge by Android phone and iPad in case I am not near a power source.Pros:1. Compact design/looks is nice.2. Power button (on/off) as opposed to no power button is great.3. Easy of use is great.Cons:1. Need car charging capabilities in case one forgets to charge the device while on the go.2. Need to have a non-slip plastic housing for the device. It could slip out of one's hand easily.3. Need a better carry case for the device rather than the cheap bag. Perhaps a rubberized, hard plastic case which is non-slip so that the Device does not need to be redesign (see #2 issue).4. If this device be adapted to charge laptops, it would be awesome?I rate this device 4.5 out of 5. This is pretty terrific device.",5
"I purchased this item to take along a 7 hr flight. This supplied enough charging power for my phone (on airplane mode) and my kindle fire on the plane, with plenty of charge left to power the navigation throughout a long car ride after, with power left to spare. I charged my phone again with it at the hotel, to see how much longer the charge would last, but I gave in and recharged the battery pack for the next road trip. The size of this battery pack is small considering it's large capacity. It comes with a little black bag and various useful cables.You can't charge this item with a car charger or USB, hence the 4-star review. This battery pack needs a power outlet. Although many cars now have one of those outlets, my car doesn't, and neither did the rental car. I would like to be able to charge this pack using a USB solar panel. The solar power Voltaic products did not offer a battery pack of this capacity when I last checked, so I went with this New Trent product to have all the battery power I might ever need on one long road trip, and it was a good purchase.",4
"Pros- Portability- dual ports allowing for charging of multiple devices- charges some devices faster than the chargers that they come with- stylish look/design of the unit- matte finish that prevents fingerprint smudges- comes with a carrying case for easy transportCons- no wall charger- not ready to go out of the box (does not come with any pre-charge)- led indicators a bit difficult to get used to to decipher- recharge time is a bit longer than other portable battery packs of this capacityExperienceFrom the start when I took this charger out of the box I fell in love with the design immediately. It was not just another simple chargerthat would be mistaken for a portable hard drive or a box of some sort. The black and blue colors gave it a distinct look that would grabanyones attention that was looking at it. Moving past the aesthetics of the product, I didnt like that it was not ready to charge my devicesfrom the start. Once fully charged, which takes longer than usual, it powered all my devices very quickly and even friends that used it wereamazed at how fast their phones were charging in a very short time (15-20% in 10-15minutes). The dual outputs are great for when I amusing both my phone and tablet simulataneously and need to charge them both without having to find a wall outlet that is in a place whereI can continue to work unhindered.I tried this charger on a Galaxy S2, S3, S4; an iPod Touch 4th Gen, an Asus Transformer Infinity tablet, a Google Nexus 10 tablet, as well asan iPhone 4s and 5, and there was no difference to charging times between any of the devices. Granted that the tablets took a little longer tofully charge due to having bigger batteries, there honestly was no noticeable difference.Rating on a scale of 1-5 (1= bad, 5= great)I would give this product 4 out of 5 because as great of a product it is, I would have liked it to be ready to be used right from the get go. Thisproduct is ones my friends have already inquired about to purchase to which I recommended that if they wanted a lot of charging capacity ina portable pack, this was definitely an item to consider.",4
"This unit has some of the best capacity and the build quality on the unit I received is top-notch. I would love (2) ports running 2amp, but most brands do not have that capability anyway.On a single charge, I was able to complete the following:(1) Gen1 iPod Touch from dead to fully charged, (3) Gen3 iPod Touch from nearly dead to fully charged, and (1) Gen1 iPad from nearly dead to about 70%. Most of the time, both ports were being used simultaneously.  I also charged my 4s iPhone in there for a short while before the capacity ran out.",5
"Used this on a two-day camping trip and it was awesome.  Because of poor cell coverage, the phone battery drained quickly. It was great to be able to re-charge my phone while it was in my backpack on a hike.  Taking it camping this weekend.",5
"Pros:* Very large capacity - able to charge iPad 2 1.4 times.* High charge rate. Charged iPad 2 to 80% in &lt;3 hours.* Fairly compact (for the capacity) form factor - feels good in the hand, nice smooth finish, rounded corners make device feel a little smaller.Cons:* Big - device measures ~4x4x1. Seems larger than the given dimensions of 3x3x1.1.* Long recharge time - takes all night to fully recharge. Note - you'd need a 12A!! (read 50W) charger to charge this thing quickly so I understand why New Trent made the choice to go with a lower cost wall wart and longer charge time.* Proprietary connector - If you want to recharge the device on the road, you have to bring the wall-wart with you. This counts as a major negative (though to be honest it's hard to run out of battery life with this capacity). This is the most major negative factor of the unit in my view.Personal Opinions:* Would rather have cables connected to unit. Some competitive units have a built in, hard-wired cable that makes using the unit much more convenient. With this device you have to pack the cables separately.* Case feels solid, but along one of the flat side is not firmly fused to battery internally. It feels like there is some sticky tape inside that adheres to the internals when you squeeze the case. This makes the unit feel a little cheap (though there is no indication that it will cause any issues).* Device gets warm when charging an iPad at 2A. This does not seem to be the case when charging at lower rate (1A).* Would like more resolution on the gauge. Three LEDs don't really give you a good idea of how much charge is left. This is tempered by the fact it's hard to run out of charge with this capacity!* Included micro USB cable feels cheap. Some reviewers mentioned a retractable cable included. The cable included with my unit was a standard, short micro USB cable. It hasn't broken, but it just doesn't give me a nice warm fuzzy feeling.* Included case is useless to me (I just throw the unit in my bag, though I'm sure some people find it a nice to have).",4
"Ok so I've been using this battery daily for over a year. It hasn't missed a beat. It still works great, still holds a charge and I was concerned about this as I am with any battery. It keeps my phone charged for days off of one unit charge. I love it. GET IT!",5
"This unit is very functional, easy to carry and the usb out makes it very universal. The 1 Amp output makes it perfect for most phones and will charge most tablets at a slightly reduced rate. If you are looking for a 2.1 Amp the IMP70D is a great unit (I also own it) for tablets.In all if you are looking for a simple battery pack that holds a charge for weeks, is good for multiple charges and portable, this a great unit to choose.",5
"1.  Here's the bottomline in regards to this product:a.  Nicely made;  very solid and fairly compact.b.  It's pretty much a no brainer to use.  Plug it in to charge up the unit.  When you need to charge up another mobile device; just use the proper cables, turn on the unit and start charging the mobile device.c.  I can't say how long it lasts because I've never had occasion yet to drain all of it's power (I've been on a trip to HI with an ipad, galaxy tab 2, i pod touch, GPS unit).d.  Flexibility:  it's a huge advantage to have one of these, especially on trips, because there will be times when the power on some device goes out and you may be on the road... and be lost... and the gps just died--> plug this little unit in and you're back in business.2.  Highly recommended.",5
"It's not that small... it may be bigger than your phone. However, I did charge my iPad, Note 3 twice and my Note 10.1Mobile devices charge normal. Charging the iCarrier takes a while though.No complaints. I'm happy with my purchase.",5
"Excellent product. Charges device (iPhone 4s, ipad 4, ipad mini, Samsung galaxy s2 etc) several times before needing to be recharged. Very durable. will recommend this to anyone that needs a reliable back up charger.",5
"If you have ever found your phone or portable device about to run out of power with no time to sit and plug it in, then this is the device for you. Even though I am at work and there are plugs around, I am not usually in one place long enough to charge my phone. The iCarrier was a great solution. Although a little thicker than I would have liked, the iCarrier is still small enough to fit in my pocket and charge my phone via short USB cable. This way, I can charge my phone even if I am jumping from meeting to meeting. I also have a car charger for my phone, but the plug is not in a convenient location. so, here again is where the iCarrier is extremely useful. The one other issue I have besides the thickness is the weight. I completely understand that something this powerful is going to have its drawbacks and that is okay with me. The iCarrier has 2 USB ports for dual charging, but one of them is a 2A output. The result is rapid charger that will charge my phone from 5% to 100% in about an hour. The iCarrier lasts 5-6 charges with my Galaxy S4 which comes with a stock 2600mAh battery and takes about 7-8 hours to fully charge the unit.The unit is basically a square battery with a smooth black shell. It's a plastic shell, but feels sturdy and firm. Overall, I am very happy with this product and am glad that I am no longer a slave to outlets.",4
5 Stars for a lifesaving product. It gets me through power outages and serves as a backup when I use my devices too long. It recharges quickly and I make sure it's always ready to go. I like that I can keep it in my pocket and simply run a usb cable to my device when I'm out and about. Hide it from your family members. They become presents very quickly. Get two! Save yourself.,5
"There are many brands of external portable chargers for devices out there these days. A long while ago I bought aZagg ZAGGSPARQ ZAGGsparq Portable BatteryZagg Sparq 2.0. I thought it was the greatest thing ever. I had never really searched for external batteries and it was quite an impulse buy. It was a really awful product I soon realized and it failed pretty quickly. I was interested in getting another but after my experience with that I really did not want another Zagg battery. I did some looking around and I discovered New Trent. I am really glad that I have discovered this great company and have since bought four batteries from them because they are so great.This battery is no exception. The iCarrier is another well built battery by them. With iPhones being the way they are today, chances are you will not be able to keep your iPhone alive all day. The iCarrier will help with that! No longer are you getting nervous looking at the battery percent realizing it will be another 5 hours before you will be able to plug it in again to charge, you just plug your phone into iCarrier! (very very convenient at amusement parks when you are in a group there all day long.)Pros: Holds loads! (12,000mAh!)Solid built, does not cheap or fragile. Quite durable.Two output ports which charge my iPhone 4S extremely fast.One small 'quiet' light letting you know it is charging, but not really bright and obnoxious.Power button you must hold for a few seconds to start the charging (making it quite difficult to accidentally start or stop the charging)Very useful as well for (you will see how great this is when you try it yourself) laying in bed or being in a comfortable chair that is not near a power outlet and keeping your device from dying. I know it may sound like being lazy but trust me, it is really great to not have to make your gaming area right next to a power outlet.Cons: Really I would just say that I think they should have a universal power adapter so you can have multiple batteries and only bring one charging cord (to charge the batteries). I have 4 and keeping all the charging cords straight can be a nuisance.If I could I would give this a 4.5/5 star rating. Certainly a fantastic must have product and I think you will love it. New Trent did a fantastic job with this product. I highly recommend it!Enjoy!",4
I have this product since November 2011 and it keeps on going! Size and weight are perfect for travel plus it will power my iPhone and iPad withy same charge.  Have dropped it a couple times and besides a small scratch mark everything still works. Highly recommended.,5
"Overall I am blown away by this product. The amount of battery power in the package has come in very handy. I've been able to charge my iPad (3rd gen), HTC Droid DNA, Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, Samsung Galaxy Nexus and an iPhone 5 with no issues. The device recharges in a reasonable amount of time considering how large a capacity it holds.  Also, it seems to charge devices a little faster than plugging into the wall. I only have 2 negatives for this device. First is size. I understand with 12000 mAh the package is probably as small as it can be, but maybe a slightly different shape to make it easier to fit into a front or back pocket. The other thing would be the possible addition of more USB ports. Two is definitely fine, but I think three or four would be amazing. Overall I would give the device 4.5 out of 5 stars and I know that I will be getting a ton of use out of the device in the future. One last point to add. I've actually found myself using this device even when I have an outlet available to me.",5
I have many business trip in nationwide USA sometime in Asia.. My iPad and iPhone are never been died before during business trips.,5
"I have had this unit for a little over 45 days now and it appears to work very well.  It will fully recharge an iPad 1st gen. from near zero to 100% with juice left over to recharge it another 20% or so.  It recharges the iPad at a rate very comparable to that of using the wall charger and the unit itself recharges reasonably quickly as well.The unit is solid and heavy but very compact.  No, it's not as light as an iPhone or other similar electronic device - it is smaller, however, than all but a few of the smallest portable external hard drives.  I bought it for an upcoming trip and don't anticipate that traveling with it will be any problem at all, anymore than traveling with my tiny lightweight camera and all the clutter of gear, extra batteries, memory cards, etc., it requires to keep going.When plugged into the iPad using the USB end of the iPad's charging/synchronization cable the unit will begin recharging the iPad when you push down on the unit's one and only button for about a full second - this can be stopped by pressing the button down again for a full second, though of course unplugging the unit would be equally effective.The only other function of the button is to show the amount of charge in the battery.  When not hooked up to a device, depressing the button will light the indicator leds to show the level of power in the battery, but it's rather a crude and inexact measure at best.  Once you go down to two leds, moreover, the discharge of the battery comes pretty quickly.Some reviewers, incidentally, have complained that no iPhone adapter is included - Nonsense!  You use your iPhone charging/synchronization cable, plugging the USB end into the battery.  No iPhone adapter is needed.Overall, this is a great little unit.  If you don't have a live outlet from which to recharge your iPad or phone, this works equally well, far from the wall socket, far from home.",5
"This is a sweet battery pack. It is about 4 inches square and 1 inch deep. It weighs about a pound or a little more. It could fit in a pocket of cargo pants or a coat.This pack powers a lot of juice. From a full charge I recharged my iPhone 4 eight times before the battery pack ran out of juice (not a dead phone but less than 30% before plugging it in.)The battery pack is smart enough to stop charging when the delta drops ( ie your device is full and the battery pack stops sending a charge)It has two USB ports so multiple devices could charge at once. The instructions state that one port is a 1 amp output, the other port is a 2 amp output (for tablets or iPads)I paired this item with a small 10 watt solar panel to charge the battery pack when away from the power grid.The indicator lights show an approximate charge (by quarters) of the battery pack.This is a great item if you need extra juice for devices that utilize a USB power cable. I would recommend this product.",5
"This battery's capacity is soooooo huge! 12,000mAh! Thats a lot of juice. I charge this baby up and it is ready to save my phones life when it is dying when I am nowhere near an outlet. It has enough juice to charge my iPhone about eight times and my Galaxy Note 3 four times! I like the compact design of the pack and the matte finish to reduce fingerprints. I hate glossy finishes on battery packs. I highly recommend this product product highly! Just charge your phone and leave the battery where it is convenient. You wont have to charge the pack for awhile haha. btw you can charge TWO things at once! BONUS POINTS",5
This charger has worked great for me. I have used it a lot on long trips and it has kept all of my devices charged up when on the go. The 2 usb ports are wonderful when traveling with others. I had 3 or 4 friends alternating using it in addition to me to keep there phones charged on a trip and it worked great. Great product for back great price! Highly recommended.,5
"Although it is bigger than my old New Trent IMP, it supposedly holds more charge; even thought it seemed to not last as long as my old one. That being said I used it ALL the time on multiple devices during SXSW and it was the only way to keep my phone and everyone's around me charged. Must have if you have a smart phone and like to not be plugged into the wall some where.",4
"Most people who own mobile devices like smartphones and tablets know how essential an external battery pack is. A number of manufacturers are making external battery packs, and the field is becoming more crowded every year. New Trent has been making these products longer than most manufacturers, and the company's experience shows in their latest product, the IMP120D iCarrier battery charger. With a rated capacity of 12,000 mAh, a fully charged IMP120D is capable of recharging several mobile devices or giving several recharges to a single device. I tested the IMP120D by charging two of my devices simultaneously, using both of the unit's USB output ports. The results were as follows:* Samsung Stratosphere smartphone. The phone had a 65% charge when I connected the IMP120D. In about 90 minutes, the phone was at 100%.* Amazon Kindle Fire HD tablet. The tablet had a 69% charge when I connected the IMP120D. In about 80 minutes, the tablet was at 100%.The recharging times for both devices were roughly comparable to recharging with an AC wall charger. After recharging the two devices, the IMP120D was still showing three LED lights. I'm not certain, but with most rechargers, this indicates 75%-100% remaining capacity. To recharge a depleted IMP120D, the user guide indicates that approximately ten hours are required with the included 5V~2A AC wall charger. For most users, an overnight charging would be sufficient.Cosmetically, the IMP120D is an attractive all-metal case with matte black finish and blue trim and smoothly rounded edges. As external battery chargers go, it's fairly heavy (10 ounces) and big (3.9'x3.7'x1.1'). That's the tradeoff for the 12,000 mAh capacity. The recharger comes with a soft fabric drawstring pouch for carrying it in.The recharging kit includes the AC wall charger, a Micro USB charging cable, and a charging cable for the Samsung Galaxy Tab. It does not include an Apple charging cable, although the charger is compatible with iOS devices.Overall, I'm very impressed with the New Trent IMP120D iCarrier battery charger. It has a solid build quality, it's reasonably compact for carrying, and most importantly, it has a monster capacity for recharging smartphones and tablets.Note: The manufacturer sent me one of their IMP120D iCarrier units to review.",5
"Let me begin by saying I love my gadgets and use them all day long.  That usually means they are always needing recharging by the middle to end of a work day.  I do a fair amount of traveling with some to foreign countries, so I picked up this battery for when I couldn't plug in someplace long enough to charge my devices.  I was able to recharge a mostly drained IPad 3 and Android phone to 100% on the same battery charge with this battery.  I really liked that!  The only thing I see that could be improved is that the battery doesn't tell you which output is for the tablet, I had to find the documentation and figure out it was output 2.  If you like functionality over 'pretty' you'll be well pleased with this heavy duty battery.",4
"This product does exactly what it says it can do.  It can charge two devices at once including a high draw item such as an iPad.  It charges from a wall adapter that provides faster charging than a mini USB input.  The device automatically powers off when your device is done charging.It's the size you'd expect for an item with this much charging capacity.  It's not exactly pocket friendly but it's lightweight for carrying in a bag or backpack.The only cons I can come up with are that it turns off when your device is charged so you can't continuously power your device after it's done charging and that the charging indicator only indicates a few increments rather than a more detailed of charge status.For the money, a great product.  Highly recommended.",4
"The New Trent IMP1000 is the first New Trent battery pack I have owned.  It is the only one that I have seen that will also work with an iPad.  I have a Griffin TuneJuice battery charger. It uses 4AAA batteries.  It works for the iPhone, but has a very limited capacity.  It can give you an extra 1.5 hours of internet time on your iPhone.  I also have the Mobile Power Station.  It also is very limited. It will give you a couple of hours of additional time. But, I have an Otter Box case and it will not plug into the iPhone while it is in the case.  It is of limited value. Finally I have the Duracell Rechargeable instant usb charger.  It will give you up to 3 hours of time.Comparing all of these chargers, the New Trent IMP1000 is significantly better.  It gives you over 50 hours of time for your iPhone or about an additional 17 hours on your iPad.  It is versatile because it will charge iPhones, iPods, and iPads.  Plus, you can take it on your travels and not need an AC outlet.  On a long flight, this will keep the iPhone or iPad working while on WiFi without running out of juice.  When you get off the plane, your device is charged and has the power longevity that you need.I considered gettin a Morphie Air Pack. It has a battery with a case. You put your iPhone into it. It is a decent battery option for the iPhone. But, it makes the iPhone much bigger and heavier. Plus, I don't want to give up my Otter Box protection. It ahs saved my iPhone from damage from falls and from water.External packs are the the way to go. They are versatile and convenient. It is important to get one that you can use with your cable so that you don't need to remove the case around the phone.  Before I had an external battery pack, my iPhone would lose its charge at the most inoppotune times.  Since iPhones do not have instantly replaceable batteries, like other phones, the only option is an external battery pack.I highly recommend the New Trent IMP1000.  It is worth the money!!Pros:-- Capacity - it will last for a week!-- Ease to use-- Size -  it is fairly compact.  About the size of a thin Egg McMuffinCons:-- Weight - It weights over a half a pound.  But, I expected a higher capacity battery to weigh more.  Since it is Lithium Ion, it actually is light for its size.  NiCads are much heaver.-- Only 1 USB port - you would not want to charge both an iPad and iPhone at the same time. It would seem that the drain would be too great.  But, you may want to charge an iPhone and iPod at the same time. Two USB ports would be nice. But, it is a preference and not an absolute necessity.",5
"Works as advertised, excellent product used it on a couple cross state trips, holds its charge and is perfect for any USB device that needs a good chargin'.",5
"I have been wanting to own a charger that I can use for my Iphone 4s which is very known for its low battery life. I have already purchased those built-in case batteries but beside from being bulky, they can only last to one charge usually. I am a heavy FB and Instagram user, plus I use my IPAD4 to oversee my current orders for my online store. So I was really in dire search for a great, long-lasting portable charger.We are planning to go to Hawaii and I NEEDED a portable charger! It would be a hassle and too inconvenient for me to find a public wall outlet that I can plug my devices. Plus, I am absolutely bringing my IPAD4 which is a must! And to walk from the beach back and forth would be such a waste of energy and time! Ugh, I should be swimming and surfing instead of charging my phone and my Ipad.So I went to Amazon, and I found some top-rated chargers. I find the New Trent iCarrier with 12000 mh the most appealing because of the product design and matte finish (but I wish it comes with more colors, or glow in the dark colors?) and best of all, it has two USB ports! That's perfect for what I needed.The product arrived right in time a few weeks before the Hawaii trip. I figured it is enough time to test it while under warranty. For daily use in the office, it lasted the whole day without any problems. I charge it everynight, and sometimes I also would forget, but surprisingly, it still would last the next day. It is also sufficient for the Ipad which has more battery life so I just needed it later in the afternoon. I am happy with my new found friend - the New Trent!My Hawaii Experience -- my phone lasted the Bart train travel time which is an hour, the checking in and boarding plus the whole 5 hours on the plane from California. I watched a full movie and played a lot of offline games. While we were on the beach, a lot of my friends, used up their phone battery life and charged with me and well enough, it lasted each day with no problems. It's a great feeling knowing my phone is always charged and available :) When resting, I turn on my Ipad and check on everything else online while listening to Music and connected to a Bose speaker using blutooth which consumes a lot of battery power. Another thing, weather in Hawaii in general was mostly hot and humid and it didn't affect the charger's full capabilities. But there was a time when we hiked and it rained! I was able to put it inside a ziplock plastic in time and it still is functioning good as it ever did. The charger's design is compact and I believe it helps keep sand and moisture away.I hope the performance lasts a long time because I love, love, love this product! And I have been strongly recommending it to my friends. This is THE ONE!",5
"I have been traveling with this battery pack since November, and have mostly favorable impressions of it.  Here are my general feelings about it.PROS1. The battery lasts a long time.  I mostly use it to charge my cell, my tablet and my iPod.  I do not need this everyday, and I usually get a one to two weeks before I need to recharge.2. Even when not used regularly, it retains an almost full charge.  I was home over the holidays, and did not use the pack for nearly four weeks.  I forgot about charging it before I went on the road, but when I still got more than a week from it before it needed charging.3. I like the size (and I know that is a CON for many other people) because it makes it easy to find in my laptop bag, even on a dark plane.4. It provides two USB outlets, so on the rare occasion when I need to charge multiple items, I can.CONS1. Weight.  Yes, I know it has a huge capacity, and capacity comes at a cost, but when you travel, every ounce matters, and this thing matters a lot.2. The other downside you often see with a large capacity is charge time, and this battery pack does take a while to get to 100%.  that means if it is drained, you better remember to charge it the night before your flight, because plugging it in while you shower isn't going to cut it.3. Shiny black surfaces for electronics is just plain dumb.  I hate fingerprints on my laptop, and I hate them on the battery pack, too.  It just makes it look messy, and mars the otherwise clean look of the pack.All in all, it provides exactly what you need; power when you don't have alternatives.  With even the planes I fly having electric outlets these days, I wondered if I would really need or use an external battery pack.  three months of usage has shown me that, despite the weight penalty, this is something I could not live without.",5
"I purchased this item because I have a number of electronic devices, and am away from electrical power sources most of the day, yet must have those devices available.  This battery pack is very powerful, and is able to charge several devices simultaneously and quickly.  I highly recommend it.  It is invaluable to have when you need your devices powered up at all times.",5
"The previous models are just as good, and lighter in weight, but their charge isn't as high as this one is. at 11,000 mAh, you literally can have it charge your iPhone, your friend's, your sister's, your parents' phones, your iPod, your iPad and maybe even your laptop if you had an adapter for it. I use it to charge my phone and iDevices when I'm on the go or just out period. It comes with a bunch of adapter heads to charge multiple devices, though you can only charge something one at a time. It's easy to use, just push and hold the power button to turn on or off.On one single overnight charge, it was able to live for about 3 days before I had to charge it again, and during those 3 days, I charged my android twice (which I have theSeidio Innocell 3000mAh Extended Life Battery for Samsung Vibrant, so that's 6000mAh used, my iPod Touch multiple times, and my nieces' phones a couple times each before having to recharge the Trent again.Do note that the manual does state that it takes a couple complete uses and charge cycles before you can get maximum use out of the Trent, so don't freak out if the first couple uses drains it quick and you have to charge it again. The Manual is there for a reason. :)",5
"I went to a conference and knew I needed a backup battery for my iPad, since I take notes and tweet all the time at these conferences. This battery pack did not let me down. When my iPad dropped below 20% charge, I hooked it up and as soon as the iPad had an 80% charge, I unplugged it (I had read online to charge the last 20% of a battery takes more power, so I always disconnect from external batteries when my device reaches 80%).This battery pack survived daily use at a week-long conference with no issues.",4
"This product provides sufficient power to use my iPad on long trips. Highly, recommend. New Trent is awesome. I use it for bith my iPhone and iPad. If you need a lot of power, get this product.",5
This device works just as described.  I have used it with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 and a Samsung Focus.  It comes with an adapter cable for use with Samsung devices and I did need it for the Focus but not the Galaxy Tab.  This was a very good purchase and I would make it again!  When at the airport and all the outlets were taken...I still was able to charge my devices...both at the same time!  Thank you New Trent!,5
"hello,i just returned from a cross country trip to miami, florida.  it was a 5 hour plane ride.  our ipods were the best thing to make the flight enjoyable.  what actually is enjoyable about being cramped in a noisy airplane for 5 hours?  the ipods started to go down in battery life. after three hours of massive ipod play.  our google nexus s phones were also going down in battery charge from use. videos, photos, games, music, etc.  the charge level went down to the low yellow with the standard warning sign that pops up.  i hooked up my new trent using the tiny adapter for the nexus s and within one hour, the google nexux s was at 3/4 charge level.  within the next hour, it was fully charged !  that was outstanding, a fully charged phone ready for use at the arrival gate.  next, i hooked up my ipod using the standard apple charge cord.  it was also down to less than a quarter charge.  within an hour on the plane, the ipod was almost fully charged.  by the next 30 minutes, it was fully charged.  this new trent seems large, but it handles anything ready for a charge using the adapters that come with the unit.  i was at a restaurant and had the charger in my jacket pocket charging the other ipod for the car ride home.  this is the best thing that has been developed for the ipods and smartphones.  when i got home, i used the new trent to charge the first ipod to full capacity while unpacking and the unit charged to full and shut off by itself.  the new trent still has lots of charging power left...  checking the three useful blue lights to see how much i have left...  before i hook it up to the wall plug.  would i buy another new trent item?  you bet.  it is the best on the market and we will not go anywhere without it.  by the way, the car 12v charging jack unit that comes with the phones does not compare to using the new trent battery pack for power and charging times.  leave that car plug unit at home.  the new trent was delivered in record time... kudos to new trent and amazon.update: 12/29/11 since the last time i used this product, i have charged my android nexus s 4 times and an iphone 3gs once, and an ipod touch 5 times from the low battery red indicator to full charge from the New Trent iCruiser IMP1000.  the cruiser finally ran out of juice after 10 full charges on three different electronic devices.  this New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 tells you that it cannot charge anymore with one blinking blue light.  when it has lots of juice left, there are three blinking lights.  plugging it into the wall charger did not take too long to go back to full charge.  this battery charger is the best on the market and i am going to purchase several more for gifts.  this New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 is very portable as it fits in a jacket pocket. it is also very stylish to even leave on the desk.an outstanding product !",5
This is a pretty good charger. It's a bit heavy to carry around so I leave in in my car in case of emergency or just in case the kids need to charge a device and we are out of outlets in the car.  I would recommend to a friend for sure.,4
"IMP120D is a must have on those family trips where there is no convenient ways to charge portable devices.  It holds 12000A which is enough juice to power up several devices.  In duration of 2 days, I was able to charge Samsung Note 2, 1st gen Kindle Fire, BlackBerry Curve, and iPhone4 without charging it again.  However, due to its capacity, IMP120D took literally about 10hrs to fully charge from nearly empty state.  If you must have fully charged IMP120D, be sure to give yourself enough time.  IMP120D has 2 outputs (5V/1A & 5V/2.1A).  Most of devices don't exactly use 1A or 2.1A input, so you have to choose one that fits best.  I did not have any issue charging any of my devices listed above, however, I'm also wondering if there could be any long term effect to the devices for not using exact input as its OEM AC wall charger; example, using 2.1A for 1Gen Kindle Fire that uses 1.8A AC.  I'd think impact is pretty minor given that difference isn't too big if at all.  Regardless if I'm using only 1 output or both, IMP120D maintained its charging efficiency. In my experience, IMP120D was able to charge devices faster than using OEM AC in many cases.  I do not like LED battery level indicator that is too bright, but indicators for IMP120D could be little more brighter since I had hard time reading the level with little bit of surrounding lights.  Label 'Output 1' & 'Output 2' can be confusing, but you can consider 1 for 1A and 2 for 2.1A.  IMP120D is reasonably sized and weighted to carry around in a bag (or wife's purse).",4
"I broke my old Tekkeon portable charger and was on the market for a replacement. Honestly, I wanted something similar where I could use any 2 or 4 AA batteries as a power source but there didn't seem to be anything good out there. Instead, I found this New Trent charger and it's awesome! It charges my iPhone quickly (through a 1A USB) and has enough capacity for about 4-5 charges (although I haven't really pushed it beyond a couple iPhone recharges). Another plus is that it has a 2A outlet for recharging my iPad as well so I can carry this on any trip as my lone power source. I go on a lot of extended camping trips so to have a high capacity portable charger is great. Although it is a little bulky, the capacity makes it worth carrying around.Pros:-Huge capacity that can charge numerous iPhones from dead to full (and probably a couple iPads too).-Substantial construction (doesn't feel cheap)-Comes with a carrying pouch-Recharges quickly with 1A USB for iPhones (and smartphones) and 2A for iPads (and tablets)Cons:-A little bulky (but understandable given the capacity)-It should label the USB ports by amperage instead of 'Output 1 and Output 2'-Built in batterytldr; bulky but  good construction with huge capacity for both iphone and ipad",5
"I uses my wifi only iPad tethered to my Palm Pixi plus cell phone for internet access when I am on the road.  Since the Palm has a very small battery, I need to have an external battery to power the tethering for a whole day.  After searching the Amazon and reading all the reviews, I purchased the IMP120D iCarrier.I have been using the IMP120D for about three months now. It performed very well without a glitch.  The capacity of this 12000 mAh battery pack is outstanding.  It keeps charging the Palm for the whole day and still have plenty of charges left. I also use it to charge my ipad 3.  The charging speed is pretty similar to that using the Apple wall charger when the iPad is in use. It charges 15% in 1 hour when iPad is not in use.The building quality is good, with a ten-month warranty.  The product also came with a nice carrying pouch as a surprise.There are two minor things that I would like to see improvements in future products:(1) There are only three charge level indicators on the device, high, medium and low. I would like to see a little bit more details than the full, 2/3 and 1/3 charge level. A five level indicator should be sufficient.(2) The blue LED lights are bright in the dark, a minor annoyance. But since charging the IMP120D doesn't generate much heat, I just put it in the pouch when charging it at night.I am satisfied with the purchase. A highly recommended product for anyone who need a backup battery to charge the electronics vis USB.",5
"The IMP120D is fairly compact given that it is a 12000 mAh charger.  It fits easily into your back pocket, a coat pocket or a purse.  It is very convenient to charge two devices at once as I am constantly using both my phone and a tablet.  The charger turns off automatically when device(s) are removed.  It has a recessed power button that helps to keep the device from accidentally being turned on.  A convenient cloth pouch is included which allows you to carry the charger and its charging cable.  The cable included has a USB A which connects to the charger and a micro USB which works for many different phones but it does not come with a cable for Apple devices.  It would be difficult for me to go without a charger such as this as I spend time outdoors away from power outlets but would like to be able to continue to use my phone or tablet.  Also, it is storm season now and when the power goes out I can continue to use my phone or table to keep tabs on the weather or just to be able to continue to read until the power comes back on.  This unit has a lot of power to take on the go in a compact size!Pros:Being able to charge two devices at once is a big plus.  I was able to charge my Kindle and my Razr at the same time.  On one charge of the device I was able to charge my Kindle once and my Razr three times.  On a recent camping trip where I only had the IMP120D to charge my cellphone I was able to charge my Razr five times and it still had power left for at least a partial charge.Cons:The labels on the two USB charging ports are difficult to read, maybe they could just have the amps posted in a larger font instead of having the words 'tablet' and 'smartphone' printed on it in very small letters.Improvements:Replace the USB port labels with something like 2.1A and 1.0A and/or an ICON of a Tablet and Smartphone making it easier to recognize which port is which. It would also be nice if the charger had at least one side covered with something more tactile than an all plastic cover (unlike some of the other New Trent devices that have a rubberized coating that prevents it from sliding around).  The charger is a little slippery and this would help to keep from accidentally dropping it.",5
"We've all been there - where you need to make an important call, but your battery is dead.  Or, you're traveling with kids and their game system, or their tablet has just died.  Work, travel, or play... our devices seem to die at the most inconvenient times.  TheNew Trent: iCarrier IMP120Dis packed full of power but won't weigh you down, and can help avert personal disasters such as those.  At 12,000mAh capacity, this power bank can recharge your tablet and phone multiple times from its power reserves, keeping you going long beyond your device's battery power.This power bank is feature rich with 2 clearly labeled USB charging ports (one capable of 2A, the other capable of 1A Capacity), an easy on/off switch and recharges with a Micro-USB cable.  Since this unit recharges with a common Micro-USB cable, you can conveniently take the power bank anywhere, recharging it in a hotel, or on the go, as needed.  Great for Android and Apple devices alike; I found no issue with using this power bank with my Nexus 7, and Android phone, and my iPhone and iPad.  This power bank is capable of charging my Nexus 7 from dead approximately 2 + charges or my Android phone from dead about 5 + times on a single charge.  This is perfect for a business traveler or gadget obsessed.  Easy to read `high', `med', and `low' LED lights near the power button indicated the current power supply left for charging.In the package:+ The iCarrier IMP120D 12,000mAh Power Bank+ One (1) Micro USB Cable+ One (1) Small Soft Carrying BagTheNew Trent: iCarrier IMP120Dfinds a great balance between tremendous capacity and light weight.  The power bank is great for tossing in a day bag or taking on a trip cross country.  For those with power hungry portable devices, the New Trent IMP120D is a `must have' product.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review. A review in exchange for the review sample was not promised. The views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.",5
I previously bought one of these ICarriers 12000mAh External Battery. The only difference is that the older one is a wall plug in charger and the new one is able to USB plug into the computer. A great product to use with my HTC One and my children's IPhone 4 and IPhone5S. I have also used the charger to also charge my Laptop,4
What a product!  I was in the mountains for 4 days and nights. My iPhone was drained each night.  I was able to plug it in at night and re-charge.  I loved the way it shut itself off after charging.  When I got back into town it still had some power.  Great product !,5
I have tried lots of different portable chargers and this one is definitely better than the rest. It allows you to charge two devices at one time so for people like me with an iPad and a phone that is a plus. The charge lasts for 10 hours which is at least twice as long as other chargers.,5
"I wanted to love this but after two charges it failed to turn on again.  It was a dud.  I bought this same brand again but I purchased the ruggedized unit.  I wanted this for traveling when the airports are usually short on places to charge up.  If this would have worked more than two days I would give it 5 stars.  It's good looking, and charged my phone twice very quickly.  If it could do this every time, I would have loved it.",1
"I was doing a lot of traveling cross country, and my iPhone 5S was not quite lasting the whole trip.  I ordered this to keep things charge, and boy am I glad that I did.Pros-Quickly charges devices (as fast or faster than a car outlet)-Charges 2 devices at once-Shuts off if attached device is fully charged (only tested with iPhone and iPad)-Able to charge my devices fully multiple times on one charge-Fairly compact size and weightCons-Takes a while to charge.  I purchased an AC to micro USB adapter, and that doesn't seem to charge the unit even after being plugged in all day.  That could have been the AC unit that I bought too though.  Computer charges this device in about 2 hours.This is a great unit for the money to keep your devices charged while traveling.  Highly recommended.",5
"Bought the New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 back on Sep 20th and have used it to charge 2 iPad's, a Blackberry Bold and a Samsung Galaxy phone.  The device holds enough charge for multiple smart phone charges, and charged my iPad from 30% to 100% battery with probably a smartphone amount of charge left over in the device.  It is simple, easy to use and the 3 blue LED indicators for how much power is left are ideal and easy to read.This device does what it says and you can literally double the amount of live usage time you have on your iPad 2 without need for an A/C or car adapter, you can charge your smart phone 4+ times over on a single battery charge.  This is the perfect device if you take long car rides or plane trips where you have limited access to outlets to charge devices.  A roadwarriors dream for sure.  Other reviews mention it's weight and size, but truth is it is about as heavy as a camcorder battery but flatter, it fits in any laptop or ipad case with pocket or jacket and I don't think it weighs that much or is that big considering how much power the unit holds in a single charge.It also charges pretty quickly and can be used to power a device that you use while it charges, or just leave in power save mode and it charged an iPad to full power in about 1 1/2 hours which is really fast for a non A/C adapter device.I have no problem recommending this product to anyone, I do wish however that they would have added a 2nd USB port so that 2 devices can charge simultaneously.",4
"Size and weight is decent, a little too big to be comfortable, for me, in a standard pants pocket, but not bad at all in a jacket pocket or cargo pocket (with a longer cable than the one provided).I was surprised, at first, that it came with its own charger, and didn't charge via a micro usb slot, like most of the other batteries that I've used or come across. It charges back up, from empty, reasonably fast, so I don't really have a problem with it. None of the other batteries I've owned or seen came with their own charger, so it's kind of a nice feature, though some might see it as less convenient to carry another charger, if they're going to be away long enough to need to charge the battery.I'm a heavy user of my phone, while commuting, so I usually leave my phone plugged into the battery during the whole commute (1-2 hrs). It performs well in this regard, keeping the phone fully charged for several commutes where I have almost 100% screen-on time and heavy GPS and data usage.",5
I have been using the Trent 120D for a few months now.  I travel constantly and don't always have time or the ability to access a charging station for my iPhone.  The IMP120 allows me to charge the phone while on the plane or waiting at the airport.  It will easily charge an IPhone 5S from 15% to 100% 8 times.  I also use it to extend the battery life on my IPad and it will recharge it about 3 times. The performance has not degraded any in the time that I have had it.  The construction is good and very user-friendly with a simple power button and 3 light charge status display.,5
"I had an issue with the power button not working, but they promptly resolved the issue with a replacement. It is so important for a company to stand behind their product and New Trent did a great job standing behind theirs. It is always useful to have a battery backup when traveling. It is an essential item for everything like an all day trip into the city or a weekend of camping or whenever you need to stay charged and a power outlet just isn't a convenient option. I even used it during a blackout to keep my cell phones charged and ready to go, This New Trent battery was the perfect size. Small enough to carry in my duffel bag, but a large enough capacity to keep things charged.",5
"The New Trent iCarrier (IMP120D) has performed perfectly and just as advertised. I received one as a gift to use with my iPhone 5S. I also purchased another for a gift because of the exceptional performance.Likes: Holds approximately 6 full charges, charges up quickly and stores the charge for a long time, manageable size, charges 2 devices at onceDislikes: Heavy (although understandable for a battery with this capacity), bright blue light will light up a roomI would recommend this for anyone that uses their smartphone enough some days for it to die before you get home to charge it.",5
"Great product and I highly recommend it.  Makes charging on the go much easier.  I never have to worry if my phone is on low battery when I leave the house.  Product arrived on time and in great condition.  The low, middle, high battery status is very helpful to know when I need to recharge my carrier.",5
Finally a item where I dont have to charge my phone all the time and go with out charging it.  This device goes with me where ever I do.  I started using this item two or 3 days ago and havent had to charge the device yet it still is holding a original out of the box charge.  It shows you how much life it has left and turns itself off when not in use.  Brillant idea.  The one and only thing about this product is the weight it is a little heavy but doesnt take away from the 5 stars and great product that this is.  Highly recommended for any one who is on the go and needs a portable system to take with them.,5
"I have owned NewTrent chargers for a while!  They were the first available, that I was aware.  As they evolve, I buy the new models.  THIS model is definitely the best yet!  The capacity is incredible.  ANYTHING that can get power from a USB jack has worked in my tests.  I have charged:1.) My iPhone's2.) My three iPad's3.) My iPad keyboard4.) Another NewTrent battery pack!5.) Bluetooth earpiece6.) My kids Nintendo DS'sIt's awesome and the capacity of the battery allows for NUMEROUS charges!  It IS the heaviest yet but still a device you can totally carry in your pocket!  I forgot my cigarette lighter car charger yesterday and used this to charge a dead iPhone on my drive home.....saved the day!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",5
"The IMP120D, also now called the iCarrier, is a hefty little block of charging goodness. A friend loaned me one and it charged my Samsung S4 and my wife's iPhone 4S twice each before we were able to drain it. We are planning a trip that will be quite long on a plane so this seems like a very good idea.The construction is solid and the heft of it means it won't slide easily. There are 3 charge indicator LEDs arranged in a crescent to indicate state of charge, 3 for full, 2 for 2/3 and 1 for 1/3. There's also another LED that indicates that the unit is on at the bottom. You press the button once to turn it on. Turning it off is pushing the same power button and holding it for a few seconds.When charging a device is completed, it is supposed to automatically turn off. I haven't tested this but leaving it charging a phone does appear to kick off when the phone is fully charged.The only downside is the charging of the IMP120D does take a while. I just let it charge when I go to sleep and it is done in the morning. So, about 8 hours, maybe less.In closing, huge battery with lots of capacity, enough to run a phone for several days between charges. I would recommend this to a friend.",5
"I purchased this product because my cell phone battery (Samsung Galaxy S2) is terrible. Rather than buy a bunch of batteries and worry about which one is charged or having them become useless with a new phone, I picked up this thinking it will last me longer. I keep the IMP120D in my bag and plug my phone during meetings, on airplanes, and sometimes in the car if I've forgotten my car adapter. The size and weight of the device is still reasonable even though this is the biggest model. On a recent hiking trip I was able to keep this in my camera case and recharge my phone, allowing us to use the phone for music and pictures throughout the day.As for the specifics of the device, I get multiple charges from it before having to recharge the IMP120D. I can't really say exactly how many phone charges I'm getting per device because I'm not usually doing a 0-100% type charge. The IMP120D charged up in a few hours from zero and the three indicator lights give you an idea of how much charge is left. It's a fairly solid piece and feels well built. I dropped it once from about waist height onto carpet and there was no problem. I have not noticed the device getting significantly warmer when in use. The pack is about as big as my fist (in circumference, the pack is about an inch thick) and weighs a little more than a grapefruit (I just checked it, I know that's subjective).One disappointment I had was that I was hoping it would charge my ASUS Transformer TF300T tablet. The ASUS has a bigger power adapter that comes with it (I'm not an electrician, but I'm assuming it needs more amps or volts or whatever). Anyway, the IMP120D will charge it, but very slowly and the charge icon doesn't appear in the tablet. If I have a phone plugged in, then the charging light on the IMP120D comes on letting me know it's fueling my phone. Tablet only = no indicator light. I was hoping since the description notes that it charges iPads that it would charge my tablet quickly, but that was more my assumption, I guess. If it would charge my tablet at a faster rate, this would be a 5 star review. To be fair, maybe that's more an ASUS problem than a New Trent problem, but just FYI.As for price value, for me, it was about being able to go a long time without having to recharge the pack and getting plenty of use out of it. I'd rather pay a little more and get the added juice. This allows me to charge my phone and my wife's, and if needed my tablet (albeit, slowly). If you're a solo user with one device, you might give one of the smaller models a look because it might achieve what you need for less cost and less size/weight.",4
I went on a 5 day trip and used it with my Galaxy S3 (which loves to use up it's battery) multiple times and a Nexus 7 which needed 1 charge thewhole trip.  I never got a chance to plug in the IMP120D to recharge it and it still kept charging my devices.The only con I can think of is that it only has 2 USB ports.,4
"I purchased this power pack back in December 2012. I was always carrying around my smartphone and tablet around with me on photo shoots, so i was always on the go and always mobile for several days at the time. I didn't have the luxury to leave my phone or tablet connected to the wall for an hour or so, either because i forget about charging my devices or i was terrified they would be stolen. That's when i happened to run into this little backup power supply. with a 12000mAh power supply, i can go several days without having to recharge my devices. I can keep all devices in my bag without having the fear of lost. Where this device really shines is at the airports. No need to search for plugs. No need to fight with others for charging time. Just sit back and relax with your power outlet in your bag. simple as that.In my typical week, i can usually recharge my android smartphone (2100mAh) 2-3x and tablet 1x. One of things that i really didn't care for was the included USB cable. The cable that was included with mine couldn't be used to transfer data between your computer and phone. i had to go out and find another small cable that could charge my phone and transfer data. Overall, the New Trent IMP120D is a must have if you're a frequent commuter and always on the move. Highly recommended.For those who have small purse or small carrying compartments and concerned about weight, i highly recommend New Trenth iTorch IMP52D instead as my wife will attest. It's one of her must have items in her purse.Things I love about the New Trent iCarrier IMP120D:- Portable (fits in your hand)- Sturdy Construction- 2 USB Ports- Easy On-off switch- Simple Battery Indicator- Small pouch to carry charger and cablesThings that can be improved:- Flimsy USB cables (can't be used to transfer data).- Power cord doesn't fit in the bag (left it at home anyways)- Charging speed reduced while charging more than two devices together (expected)",5
"As one who is in meetings frequently, I have been looking for a power solution that could carry my iPhone and iPad. NewTrent has hit a homerun with this one, as it charged both at least twice before I had to recharge the battery. Additionally, the size of this product lends itself to being easily carried in a briefcase or backpack.After using this product for several weeks, I could not recommend it more highly for anyone who deals with all-day meetings.",5
"As long as you charge it for about 12 hours, this thing is amazing. It will charge your iPhone AT LEAST 6 times.",5
I bought this because my new phone (droid 4) doesn't have a battery that you can take out.  I used to have extra batteries for my Droid X that I would keep charged to exchange when one when dead.  But this thing works great.  You can charge two things at once. I have charged two cell phones at once and it works great.  I don't know how it works with other things like tablets.,5
"The IMP120D is a study little powerhouse of a charger. I was tired of my iPhone running out of juice too early in the evening (yes I play a few games). I looked at many chargers and read many reviews - and I chose this model. It may not be the tiniest, but it is small enough to fit in a pocket of my purse so I can carry it with me. It has TWO USB PORTS - so my husband and I can both re-charge our phones at the same time when we are out and about. It holds a much longer charge than many of the other chargers on the market. I like to keep my iPhone and iPod charger cords plugged in at home so I want additional cords to take with the IMP120D. My suggestion for improvement is to offer the various charger cords (iPhone, iPad, etc.) as optional add-ons with the sale of the product. That would be very handy.",5
"Testing and reviewing batteries with a battery analyzer has sort of become my hobby lately.  Testing portable chargers like this was a learning experience, but this is the third one I tested.  I used a CBA-III battery analyzer to check the actual capacity of the charger, and there is some good news and some bad news.Good news is that the charger does supply about 44.4Wh * 90% efficiency - at 1A.  It should theoretically give 39.96Wh from the USB port, and my 1 Amp test showed 39.56Wh for 98.9% capacity.  This shows the internal battery is the advertised size, and the converter efficiency is around 89% (best I've seen so far is 90%).  The discharge curve for the 1A test is as expected: a long line around 5.15V, then a perpendicular cliff as the device shuts down and output suddenly goes to 0V.  As a note, the unloaded output voltage is 5.35, and the loaded is 5.15.  The loaded is within USB spec, but unloaded is outside of the 5% tolerance.The bad news starts with some neutral or good news: the test results at 2.1A showed 36.76Wh output, or about 91.9% of expected.  This is 7% less than the 1A discharge - and that's to be expected.  I'm not sure how much less I should expect at 2A instead of 1A, but it seems reasonable to me to lose 7%.The bad news is that the output quality at 2.1A starts out good but after a few minutes, the voltage drops to 4.5V (10% deviation) and stays there.  It gets worse as the battery is about to die, and the voltage sags to about 3.9V before shutting down.  Powering a device like a tablet or a Note 2 at 4.5V when it expects 4.75-5.25V means that the device's internal converter will have to work harder to charge the same as if it received 5V.  This decreases efficiency, and causes more heat to be generated in your tablet/phablet/etc.How much extra depends on the device, and I can't say with certainty what the effect will be ie: 'will it significantly reduce the lifespan or the device or not?'  For the price, I'd expect better power regulation at 2.1A.I felt the charger during the 2.1A test and it didn't feel like there were any hot spots.  I have included in my first comment a link to the chart from the battery analyzer generated by testing this charger.",3
Slightly bulky but this battery is very reliable and provides a lot of extra juice. I took it with me while traveling in Europe and it was great to boost a couple phones throughout the day. Charge it overnight and good to go the next day.,5
I wish we had bought this sooner. Great to be able to charge our phones on the go. We no longer need to worry about running out of juice while we're away from home or the office and we no longer have to scavenge for an outlet and sit by it to charge. Great for charging our iPads as well. Battery lasted through 4 full charges for our smart phones (HTC Thunderbolts - 2 charges apiece). Take a few hours to fully charge up. Only thing I wish it had was a built in cable to charge devices. Carrying bag is a nice touch and helps store the cable so not a huge deal.,5
"This battery pack is the AWESOME!!!!!Being a Teck Junkie I have many rechargeable gadgets, and it gets hard / confusing remembering when was the last time I charged my, Galaxy Note 10.1,Ipad,Asus tablet, Galaxy Note 8.0 etc. With this battery pack all of that is in the passed! I mean, I can charge the IMP120D once, and depending on the usage I can have access to charging my gadgets anywhere at anytime for an entire week!!!  The IMP120D has 12,000mah,  is a BEAST!!!!! and the best thing about it is the size. This charger is so small that I have carried it in my pants pockets without any problems. This charger is so cool, that it has turned into one of the MUST HAVE items with me before I leave the house. If you are a tech junkie or not. Or you just want to have access to charging any of your devices at anytime any place this is a MUST HAVE!!!!!",5
"This has definitely came into handy and been put to good use by myself and others! haha.  Just what I needed, does the job.  It's a little heavier than expected but it's not too bad.  Charges my phone at a good rate.  My friend wants one so I'll be placing an order for another.  Thank you! =)",5
After looking at a few different portable battery chargers I went with the IMD120D and have loved everything about it. It is a nice size easy for traveling. Once charged I am able to charge both my ipad and iphone at the same time. I also like that it gives me a few chargers and I don't have to recharge it everyday. I would recommend to my friends.,5
"My husband was looking for a portable charger for his cell phones. He came across this and I ordered 2 of them.  The Trent is a must have in case your battery device is almost dead. This charges our phones like a charm and haven't had any problems with it at all. It seems to charge pretty fast too, so I highly recommend the New Trent. :)  Shipping was prompt as we received it pretty fast - Thank you!!",5
"I had problems using my device as the manual is not really clear on how many times and for how long you need to press the power button in order to start charging.I was able to charge the device fully, but when I plugged in my Iphone to charge nothing would happen. After a few tries I was able to power on and mastered the device, you dont need to press the button for 3 seconds to turn it on, just a simple push will do.Besides that I love the little bag that comes with it so I can keep the charger secure inside my purse. It is also very compact and looks like an external hard drive, but much lighter. Im very pleased with my purchase.",5
I think it's a great product.  I'm anxious to use it when I travel and won't have to find an outlet on the go to charge up my phone and tablet.  My experience in airports is that everyone else is using the outlet and I have to wait until they are done and by then I don't have enough time to charge up my devices.Right now I'm using it around the house and I'm impressed how many times I can charge up my iphone before ever recharging the external battery.,5
"Initial charge took 6-8 hours ... I did not time it. Then charged iPhone 5 from 15 - 100%. Took about 1 hour. Have subsequently charged it from 50-100% in ~ 1/2 hour, and the charger still has full charge (3 led's lit). It is lighter than I expected too. So far, a great device.",5
"I had purchased a Mophie for my iPhone (4,4s) and they stopped working. So, I started researching for a portable battery charger that had the power to charge two gadgets at the same time. Because of my busy schedule, I'm always in need of a way to charge my gadgets. After all my research, I decided to try the &#34;New Trent IMP 120D&#34; which has been a great addition to my gadgets. I won't leave or travel away from home without this battery charger.Pros- fully charged my iPad and iPhone at the same time ( because of the dual charging outputs)- comes with a convenient carrying pouch- has a USB charging cable for my sons' Android- battery check which shows how much power is left (low,med and high)-also charges iPod Nano, iPhone 5, portable Braven speaker and my digital camera- charging unit holds a full charge for a week- small enough to fit in my bag without adding a lot of weightCons- doesn't come with USB charging cable for iPhone but it is compatible with the Apple cable* I would recommend this product to anyone that's looking for a reliable and powerful external battery backup for their potable gadgets. I have no complaints!",5
I like this battery a lot.  I upgraded from my 5200mAh iTrent battery and can now charge my iPhone 5 five times without needing to charge the battery itself.  There are many times where it's not convenient to be near an AC outlet and this will be a very helpful product for me.,5
"I purchased this to charge a lot of my gadgets on the go, from the iphone to the ipad. I was elated to find it charges a lot more with the adapters it has. Android tablets & phones also! I was also pleasantly surprised to find it powers some devices that allow USB power, and with a Type M barrel/ USB cable it will power devices that normally need to be plugged in to an outlet! I'd say any device that can run with 5volts will work best and have the longer ability to run with a full charge of the IMP1000 battery pack. I was able to power my Wifi Pineapple Mark IV from the New Trent IMP1000 for about 1.5 hours. It doesn't take to long to fully charge the IMP1000 back up to full power and then it's ready to go again. Great portable charging or powering solution on the go. Quickly becoming one of my favorite most used devices. I would highly recommend this for anyone on the go a lot with a lot of gadgets or devices. I'm sure there other combinations of cables and adapters you could use to power or charge camera's, USB Wifi, Portable Storage devices, etc.If I had any cons for the device and it would be a stretch, It could be less bulky or heavy. Not that is super heavy or large, but smaller and lighter is always better when traveling!",5
"The New Trent IMP 120D is a large-capacity but still compact power bank with a nominal 12,000 mAh rating.  This gives it enough power to recharge cell phones and other small devices many times over and it will even fully recharge a large iPad with a battery at 25-30% capacity remaining, calculated using a conservative 70% efficiency ratio.There are two clearly-labeled ports, 2.1 A and 1.0 A.  Both can be used at the same time.  The 2.1 A port is generally used for Apple products and some other larger devices such as tablets.I really like the sleek, sporty design with the blue stripe and the blue LEDs to indicate remaining capacity&mdash;it's as handsome as a power bank can be.  The quality of manufacturing is as good as the design.  The on-off button is easy to press and the dedicated wall charger and charging port allow for fast recharging although I find that it's most convenient to leave it plugged in overnight, anyway.Dimensions are under 4' x 4' x 1' and weight is under 10 oz. so it's very portable and easily fits in a bag.  It comes with a wall charger, cables, and a storage pouch.  It's generally best to use the cables that came with a phone as sometimes generic ones don't work.  If there is any doubt about whether it will work with a particular device, I would suggest contacting New Trent customer service before ordering as sometimes all that's needed is a particular cable.A power bank with this capacity is ideal for people who not only forget to charge their phone but who also forget to charge their power bank!A sample was provided for unbiased review.",5
"I've had good and bad experiences with external batteries for my iDevices and I'm happy to report that the iCarrier 120D is my favorite. With two ports it can charge two devices at the same time. That's a big plus but also a bit of a minus if you're charging an iPad. An iPad tends to draw more current than most USB devices so you need to remember that only the #2 port can accommodate a high current device.Last year after Sandy hit I was stuck without power for about ten days. With only portable radios and my iPhone (fortunately loaded with books (both text and audio) as my only form of entertainment. I had two 120Ds that kept my iPhone charged for a good amount of the time. I was also fortunate enough to have friends with access to power that were able to charge them a couple times each. I now have six of the batteries.The first two that I owned were the early models that used an external charger. The other four are the newer models that will charge from any USB port. The newer ones are more convenient but unfortunately don't come with a charger. This really isn't a problem because I suspect most of us are drowning in USB chargers. If you don't have one, NewTrent has a nice, high power, dual port one here on Amazon for under $10.One great thing about the 12oD is the price. Under $40 for a 12000 mAh battery is quite a bargain! That's one reason I don't mind stocking up. The overall shape and weight make them easy to carry so you can always have one around in case of emergency. These are excellent batteries and not only do I highly recommend them, I actually doubt your sanity if you don't grab a couple at this price.",5
"I had to RMA the first unit and it upset me. I needed it for travel . Once I got back, it was RMA'd without trouble. Went on travel again and made my phone last on that 16 hours of game play without a sweat.Product is great. The manufacturer has great customer service!",5
"Once again, for the road warrior this is a great back up when you are in a work environment or trade show and don't have access to a wall charger",5
"I have used the New Trent iCarrier 12000 external battery pack for a few weeks and already find it indispensable. I use it for my Galaxy S3, my iTouch and my iPad 2 to recharge them, on the road and at home. It is very convenient to be able to charge two of them at once from my desk or couch without having to get down on the floor and plug in the charger. My S3 phone has developed a habit of running out of juice before the end of the day and this device will recharge it in less than an hour and still have plenty of juice left for more. I only have to recharge the iCarrier about once a week. I agree with all of the positive reviews on this site. I find this device to be very simple to use once you remember to hold down the on button for 3-5 seconds to turn it on. My only suggestion would be to have a place on it to connect a strap that could be used to secure it to a post or armrest so it does not slip off the table. I consider it a great way to get extra battery life without adding a bulky battery to my phone/iDevice.",5
"This powers up my and my husband's Droid phones very quickly.  It has two USB ports to charge both phones simultaneously.  The battery itself can charge my phone at least three times without having to recharge the external battery.  Only downsides are that it needs to charge for several hours (5+) for a full charge, it's slightly bulky but not bad for all the power it holds and I wish it had a regular plug for charging other items that don't have a USB adapter (DVD player or laptop).  Other than those little picky things, it is a great battery for the Smart Phones that die by noon after being fully charged first thing in the morning.",4
If you live where the power goes out and if you travel and need your phone and ipad charged this is the one to get.  Holds enough power to fully charge my iPad.  I make certain I keep it with me and charged because I can't bear to be in a creative mood and not have my toys charged.,5
"I bought the New Trent iCarrier 12000 after researching all the options for a single solution external backup power supply for my iPad 3 and Samsung Droid Charge. I knew up front that a heavy duty, high output charger would be a little heavy so I looked for a nice form factor with 2 charging ports (one that supported the new iPad). This unit looked good in the pictures and with the price on Amazon this model met my specifications at an affordable price. So far it has more than fulfilled my expectations. I will come back and add to this review as I use this over time.",5
"This is possibly the battery pack to end all battery packs. An extra 8 hours on the new iPad is a very impressive feat and I have to say I am almost completely satisfied with decision to go big and get the iCarrier. It charged 3 separate phones 2 times each from 5%. The only downside is that it takes 10 hours to charge to full. I wish it would charge a bit faster, but for the capacity there really is nothing better right now. Pack this in your bag when you leave for extended trips and never worry about running out of power on your mobile devices.",5
"This item has a good size to it, was able to charge my cell phone AND my iPod touch at the same time fairly quickly. I even tested it with my eGo passthrough (which requires 5v @ 2A) and it kept right up @ 4.7 volts solid. Can't say much for recharge time, as when I drained the battery, I plugged it in overnight, and woke up to it fully charged. Since the overall size of the unit (and this thing is large, about the size of 2 decks of playing cards) doesn't matter to me, I'm not putting that in either pro or con. Nice overall weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. I would consider moving the lights that indicate the charge of the unit away from the plug, perhaps on the side, or have its own meter.Pros: Dual USB charging ports, both being 1A or over. Nice 12,000 mAh size. Somewhat bright and easy-to-read indication lights. Holds charge with no leakage according to multimeter. Comes with standard USB to microUSB charger.Cons: Build quality - It felt a little cheap. I think that the underside of the housing sticks to something internally, because I can feel it peel away when I squeeze it. Takes actual wall plug to recharge, as opposed to charging via USB.",4
We use this for recharging our iPhone at craft fairs.  We use the phone to run our credit cards and this device is simple to use and very effective.  charged the phone fast and still showed almost a full charge on the back up.  I don't know how many charges you can get from this device but it will be several I'm sure.,5
"The IMP120D works well. It charges my iPad 3 to 60-65% from dead. I have found that a Bluetooth keyboard staying on a really drains the iPad battery quickly, this is the perfect solution to give me all day and night juice. The unit itself is heavier than I thought it would be, about twice the weight of an iPhone. It charges to full power overnight from fully drained. I use my droid cellphone charger (micro USB port). It is plastic, and feels plastic, but it is sturdy and doesn't feel cheap. I do not like the bright blue lights that stay on while charging. I also wish It would have came with a short USB lightning cable, but the one from AmazonBasics works great. Overall I like it a lot and it give me the extra life that I need on my iPod. A few changes could make it better namely less light while charging and a built in lightning cable. It is a good quality product that is very reasonably price for the juice that it provides.",5
Small enough and light enough to fit in a purse and carry around with you. A little heavy for a pocket but you can fit it there too if you need to. It has an enourmous capacity to charge your phone (i also use it for bluetooth headphones)and any rechargeable that one logs around (I also have a portable wi-fi transmitter which can also be charged with this) Plug it at night (once a week is enough for me) and take it with you.,5
"I really like external battery chargers. They're so great for on the go and I have yet to be disappointed by any I've gotten from New Trent. The iCarrier is no exception to that and it's a beast of a battery coming in with 12,000 mAh it just keeps charging and charging and being that I love gaming I love to kill a battery and this let me keep at it while barely putting a dent in the battery.I love the design of this one as it's something a little different than just an all black battery with a nice blue trim around the edge to give it a little something extra in my opinion. It also comes with your standard USB cord for charging your device or the battery unit itself as well as coming with a very nice felt carrying bag to keep everything together.The light setup on this battery is slightly different than others I've used but it comes with a high, medium and low (so about 4,000 mAh per light) and of course the power light. When on you can quickly check the amount of power left in the battery by simply tapping the power button and it will show you how much is left.As with most of the larger capacity batteries I've dealt with this one also comes with the standard 1A port for smartphones and the 2.1A port for tablets. Turning the device on and off is easier than some I've dealt with and the way the button sits it won't be turned off easily on accident though so no worries about not charging when you think you are. Plus a nice feature I haven't noticed on many chargers I've tried is that it turns off immediately when you unplug your charging device whereas most take a few seconds or sometimes much longer which uses that precious battery power.This is light enough you can actually carry it in a pocket which I have (although you may need a longer USB cord) especially a cargo pocket while my phone sits in my top pocket or while I just hold it and use it while it charges. I even sometimes hook it up and play some games which is one of my biggest battery killers most days so having an extra 12,000 mAh is pleasant because even after a few days of using the battery as my only charger when I'm not home (and I just leave my device on the charger at night while I sleep) I have only managed to kill about half of the battery on this monster of a charger.So to say I'm pleased is an understatement in this case. Having smaller batteries can be okay but this may be the one to remain in my carryall daily bag along with my gaming controller and other random daily bits because even though this thing does take some time to recharge (and I just put it on a spare charger I have to recharge it overnight) it lasts me days and that's something I like. So if that seems like something you need I'd definitely look into this haus...you won't be disappointed.",5
"is by far the best battery backup that I've used to date. I've owned IMP500 and just purchased NT6000 a few months ago  but the icarrier charges my iphone multiple times  & my ipad fully. It charges quickly, in half the time of regular chargers. My only dislike is that it doesn't have the plug to directly charge it to the wall. But I LOVE IT. If you have multiple gadgets as I do, you will need this battery  Now I can share charging with others and still charge my phone sufficiently.",5
"We purchased the iCarrier right before we left for our Disney vacation as it came recommended from one of the Disney bulletin boards. We got it in and didn't really have time to test it, just to charge it. So we took it our first full day in Disney and it was great, our phones starting running low because of all the Disney apps we were running but with the iCarrier we never once had to turn either my wife's or my phone off. The charger gave us enough power for the full day and then some. We even found ourselves using it to charge our ipads and ipods when we didn't have enough outlets in the hotel room.Highly recommend this to anyone who needs a little extra juice to keep their devices charged.",5
"I have used this portable charge for a couple months now.  It works great.  It charges my Nexus 5 and Nexus 10 with no issues what so ever.  If you are having issues with slow charge, try a different cable as I found some cable charge slower than others.",5
"I'm a power warrior when it comes to my iPhone and iPad. I can blow through a battery a couple times a day. This has lead me to be an expert when it's come to spare power options and devices. I've been a fan of New Trent fo some time now, having tried many other popular brands before trying them. Once again, I have not been disappointed. This is another war horse. It's reliable and powerful. I rely on it and it hasn't let me down. Not once... Consistent with their other batteries, it's a great looking unit and it fits easily in my pocket pant or blazer pocket. A winning piece of equipment.",5
"This battery will charge my iPhone 5 from dead to full 3 times on one charge. It will charge my iPad 1.5 times. I own two, and have friends who bight it on my recommendation. All love it. Must have item.",5
"Everything about this backup battery is great. Build quality, weight, size and charge time.I would prefer that it came in a slimmer profile. Other than that there is nothing of better value than this product.",4
"The iCarrier IMP120D is the best portable power supply I have owned for charging USB powered devices.  I have used this while sitting in a deer stand charging 2 iPhones.  I have used this on vacation, keeping 3 iPads and 2 iPhones charged while jumping airports and planes, and while traversing the smartphone hungry Walt Disney World.  It has performed flawlessly.  I did try to use a cheap knock off charging cable and I noticed a huge difference, but it was not the charger's fault, I switched cables and instantly you could see the difference in how fast it charged.+'s -- huge battery to handle multiple charges, I have not put a dent in it yet.- charge 2 devices at once (try to do that with your lipstick sized charger)- though the size is bigger than the smaller chargers, i went overboard with the 12,000mAh one so the size was expected.- the on/off button is in a good spot, i haven't accidently turned it on like other similar ones I've used.-'s-when charging an iPad and an iPhone, a noticeable difference is seen in the charging rate, but it is to be expected with the huge battery on the iPad.I'm extremely happy with the charger and would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a large capacity charger.",4
"It's been a couple of years since I got an external battery for my portable electronics. That seemed ample with 2000 mAh. Times have changed. The latest iPad (4) has a battery that holds over 10,000 mAh of power and requires a serious backup battery to recharge it. Enter the New Trent iCarrier. It recharges an almost empty iPad. My battery indicator indicated 7% when I started charging. I still used the iPad for almost an hour while it was charging, yet the iCarrier managed to totally charge the iPad. Excellent. The charging seemed to take about as long as it would have had I plugged it into my MacBook Pro.The iCarrier took about 4 hours after that to recharge itself when plugged into myBelkin 2-Port Swivel Charger for iPad/iPhone/iPod (F8J003tt04).Fit and finish for the iCarrier are good. Everything is assembled tightly and the looks are pleasing to me. It's not Apple slick, but few things are. It's certainly much nicer looking than my old external battery. The iCarrier has a blue LED that indicates that it's either charging or powering something. When it's charging there are three blinking lights that indicate how much charge it has. When it's charging something else, there are two LEDs that show that everything is working. Unlike some LEDs these are subtle. You have to look closely to see if the iCarrier is charging something in daylight. At night the LEDs won't light up a hotel room, unlike some gadgets I own. I appreciate the subtle approach that New Trent uses here.Problems? Not really, just a couple of small things I'd like to be different. The iCarrier doesn't come with it's own wall charger, though I own several that came with my phone, iPad and Kindle Touch. Also, I can charge the iCarrier from the USB port on my computer, so the lack of one more charger is trivial. The other point is the form factor. The iCarrier is square and just over an inch thick. If might fit more easily in myScottevest Men's Multi-Pocket Travel Vestwere the battery a bit thinner and longer. However, the iCarrier is a bit heavy for most pockets. That's not a complaint, just a side effect of the large capacity the iCarrier has.All in all, I'm quite happy with the product. Disclaimer. I'm reviewing an iCarrier supplied by New Trent for review purposes.",5
After a few months of use my first unit stopped charging.  I contacted New Trent and they promptly sent me a replacement.  I have now had the unit for a couple of months and it is working great!,4
This is an awesome portable recharging battery that does not weigh a lot. It takes a while to recharge but once ready it lasts a real long time. It's a good value. I have 2 of these now.,5
"I travel a lot and i often find myself cuddled to a outlet at the airport trying to power up my devices.  This charger charges the two things that i constantly use, my ipad 2 and my iphone 5.  The device charges my devices multiple times with one charge.  The are two complaints/recommendation is that they should change the finish of product and the should have a built-in wall plug.  The plastic smooth finish increases the chance of it slipping out of your hands.  A build wall charger would eliminate carrying the addition wall adapter to charge the device.  Other than that, i would definitely recommend the device.",4
"I purchased this along with the Powerpak Twelve.  I leave this in my backpack when I play with my band on the weekends.  The clubs we play are super gross so I like to be able to charge my stuff without taking it out of my bag.We screw around on our phones the whole way to the show so they're usually at like 50% when we get there.  I can charge all 3 of our iphones (obviously not at the same time) and then plug it into my iPad if we're watching a movie on the way back.  This thing appears to have a ton of juice but I haven't pushed it very hard.  I'll update this post when I do.Just like the Powerpak twelve, it's a little too bulky to keep in your pocket but not as big as the picture makes it seem.  It's really made to be in your bag.  This one is a little shorter and fatter than the Powerpak but it looks cooler.I would recommend this but so far couldn't tell you much of a difference between this and the powerpak.  This one comes with an AC charger and the Powerpak does not.",5
"Short story: Recommended. Works well. It's small and easy to carry.I bought a newSamsung Galaxy Nexus 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)and I knew that I would need an extra battery to make it through the day while traveling. I didn't want the extended battery like theSamsung Galaxy Nexus (i515) Extended Battery with Battery Cover. It's only 250mAh which is nothing. I also needed something portable since I fly quite a bit. This device fits the bill.Since it's LiON, it doesn't have memory like other batteries. You can start using it right away. It ships with a retractable USB to microUSB connector which is handy. Like all retractable cables, it feels a bit delicate, so be careful not to over extend the cable. The LEDs, as others have mentioned are ridiculously bright and can serve as a make-shift night light. It really is that bright. When I travel, I just bury it under a book or towel. I could do without the bright LED's though. Just a style thing. The wall wart is typical size.In use this works as you would expect. I get perhaps 4-5 charges before I need to charge it back up which takes 5-7 hours. On a recent trip, I took my phone down to 10% battery before I even got on the plane. Once airborne, I plugged the phone in to the iCruiser and watched a two hour video and played some games while the phone charged to full. About 3 hours total, perhaps? I never would have made it through my morning, let alone a day, without an extra battery. The next day, I purposely drained the phone and recharged several times during the day to exercise the battery and see how it would perform. Worked great. The power cord on the wall wart is long enough that you can use a floor strip common at trade shows and keep the battery on the table.Another big plus is that the batter pack is small. I can fit it into a shirt pocket (typical button down shirt size) charge my phone. Sure, it's looks goofy and I have to be careful of the power cable, but it works. The micro-USB connector seems a bit delicate (they all do), so I simply had to be careful. There is enough cable that I could keep the battery in my pocket and use the phone.One thing to note. When I first got the iCruiser, I used an existing USB cable from my OG Droid. It didn't work. The Galaxy Nexus never charged and in fact, drained while I was using it. I almost returned the iCruiser because I thought it was defective. I read the pamphlet that came with it and thought I'd try once more with the supplied USB cable. Sure enough, my phone charged like a champ even while in use. The point? The Motorola USB cable is either defective and never noticed since I use it with a wall wart OR Motorola did something special to the cable. If you aren't getting good charge times, try a different USB cable.I nicked one star for the simple reason that the iCruiser doesn't have an auto shut-off and I expected one. I left the phone to charge overnight with the iCruiser not plugged into the wall. I woke up with a charged phone and a dead battery. I honestly don't know if having a auto shut-off when full feature is even possible, so if someone can clarify that it is not, I will likely add the star back in (can't nick a star due to my expectations if the product works as it should).",4
"Great product that does the job. I like New Trent products better than other chargers I have tried. The downside of the IMP120 and IMP99 is that they use a proprietary charger opposed to a standard usb charger. If I was to buy again, I would only get the Newtrent models that uses usb. I think that is how the newer once come. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just becuase of the special charger. I do recommended newtrent to friends and family. Kids love them. Although they play too much on their devices.For Newtrent Products I own IMP70D, IMP99D, IMP120D and looking to get a couple more.I have tried this with:HTC One, Droid Max, Ipad, Ipod, Iphone, Nokia 929, Nexus 7,",4

Bought the item in preparation for a trip to Greece. I used it a bit before the trip. It charged up rather quickly and held the charge well. I used it to charge up my Galaxy Tab 2. I recommend this product for anyone looking for an extra battery pack for a tablet. Only thing I wish it would have came with was a wall outlet.,5
I've never seen so much power squeezed into such a small package.  I liked this product so much I bought two of them!  People seem to complain about it's size without realizing this is actually very small for the amount of power it holds.,5
"I've had this product for about two weeks now and I absolutely love it!  It's simple to use and quite powerful.  I've charged my iPhone twice now and and the iCarrier is still fully charged.  I was very impressed by that.  The unit is small enough to fit in my backpack and stays cool to the touch.  It even comes in a little cloth bag to protect it.  In other reviews people talk about the blue LED lights.  I don't have a problem with them and they're not distracting at all.  Overall, I give this product an A.  It's a great device, especially at a time when we are so dependent  on our smartphones and tablets to stay powered!",5
"The older version has been solid for me and I've enjoyed using it.  Wanted to get this one to have another now that my kids have tablets and ipods, so we can use more for longer trips.  This unit is larger than my older one but with two plugs it'll double it's usefulness.  Looking forward to trying it for longer trips, etc, but in limited use so far (one day trip to disneyland) it worked like a charm.",5
"Coming from a similar sized 'no name' charger I was a little concerned that the IMP120D had the capacity it claimed. Boy was I wrong.PROS: small form factor, charging ports for 2 devices, very long lasting chargeCONS: No microUSB recharging (has own power cord), LEDs don't give full picture of current charge stateBottom line: it fits in the palm in your hand and gives you power for days.",5
"but a nerd who has a fully charged phone. BEE-YOTCH. lets see if amazon flags this comment. solid. durable . looks ugly. YEP, I look like a nerd",4
"I gave my first IMP1000 to give as a gift. It works great, and I've used it on business travel myself. My mother-in-law travels quite a bit and I figured this would be perfect to help keep her iPhone and e-reader charged on a trans-Atlantic flight. She's delighted with it, and I expect it to be as useful and reliable as the previous purchase.",5
"The directions for this unit are sadly lacking - a leaflet with scant information is included. However, it really is almost idiot proof (the evidence being my ability to figure it out!).  I charged it overnight and then fully charged my iPad 3rd generation to 100% from 42%.  The New Trent battery then indicated it had minimal power.  Based on this I know it will easily recharge my iPhone multiple times.  If you're an apple user you need to use your own apple cords.  New Trent cheaped out on the tacky fake velveteen drawstring carry/storage bag it comes with and really need to consider an upgrade there.  I'd certainly recommend it for anyone who travels.  I waited for the price to come down before purchasing, but even without the reduction Amazon's price is as low, if not lower than other sites I checked out including the New Trent site.  Five stars because it does exactly what I bought it for - extends the useage time of both my iPad and iPhone while travelling.",5
"What a great device! I've had this product for about 2 weeks and it's apowerful little bugger. I've already had a chance to use the iCarrierwhile at a developers' conference and it kept my iPad and iPhone fullyjuiced! I hate traveling because I'm always either trying to conservebattery life (who wants to do that) or looking an outlet I can charge onfor a few minutes. Travelling just became easier and less stressful!The capacity is outstanding, 12000mAh is awesome and I find it funny whenpeople complain about the weight. The design and material of the case iselegant and well thought out. There is only a small tweak I would add.When I traveled on an airplane with this device I did some charging whilein flight so my devices would be fresh when I hit the ground. Since planescan experience some minor bumps from time to time it would be great ifthere were some small rubber pads to help it grip. It slides around on theairline tray too easily. But this is a minor detail in all reality.Since I have both an iPhone and iPad it's great to be able to charge bothdevices at the same time and be charging them at max charging rate sinceone USB port is 2.1A (iPad) and the other is 1A (iPhone). Both ports arelabeled nicely so you can quickly distinguish between the two. Also, thereare nice blue led indicators on the iCarrier which help you quickly see howmuch juice you have left to provide to your other hungry devices.*Overall Pros:* Capacity, sturdy feel and build, aesthetically pleasing,",5
"12,000 mAh was the largest size I found and I'm glad I stuck to this one. Charges my phones and ipads well. I'm VERY happy with this.",5
"I bought this for my girlfriend because we both loved the New Trent charger I already had and I was tired of sharing. This thing is a beast when it comes to capacity. It'll charge most smart phones at least 5 times on one charge, all in a fairly small package. The dual USB ports allow charging of two devices simultaneously. This is a must have for those that are on the go or have modern power sucking phones.",5
Simply put an amazing product. It is a fantastic on the go charger for my iPad has plenty of power to recharge it multiple times just as if you were using the wall charger. It will also charge another usb device at the same time. Great value and a must when traveling.  Highly recommended.,5
"I received the Icarrier and was thrilled to see that it was halfway charged. I brought it to a complete charge so that I could fully test out the charged on the iPad 3. The Icarrier did a great job charging my iPad. Of course it takes a long time to charge, but not because of the Icarrier, just something with Apple and how they made this system. My iPad was 45 percent charged. It took 6 hours to bring it to full charge.The iPad 2 was at 68 percent capacity. It took 2 hours and 45 minutes to charge back up to 100 percent. I was checking email and streaming at the same time.My iphone 4 was at 56 percent charge. It took the Icarrier 75 minutes to charge it back to 100 percent. Overall I love this charger. I only wish it would beep or make a sound when it's fully charged.",4
"It was bought for a long trip to keep devices charged, it worked extremely well. I loved having two usb ports on it and being able to charge an iPad and mobile phone at the same time. It's been very easy to use, well built, and a good investment overall . That being said, it does seem to be noticeably weaker that it was initially, it has a difficult time charging 2A devices any more and does not charge them as much before needing recharge. A 4.5 of 5 would be my rating, great device, okay lifespan",5
"I've had this product for over 7 months now and have never been let down. Out of the box you get the New Trent iCarrier, a microUSB charging cable and the carrying case for the battery pack. As with most new external battery packs, it's recommended to charge it before using, to make sure it's fully charged, but straight out of the box, this one holds a decent charge already. I was able to charge my HTC One S from 16% to 98% and the battery lights still indicated 2 bars, so that's outstanding. Since my purchase, I've used this on many occasions to recharge my new phone, Nexus 5, for my iPod touch (sometimes at the same time) and a good amount of times my iPad 3rd gen. All devices start charging instantly and are well on their way when I check back on them. It's easy to use, just plug in the USB to the appropriate port 1amp for phones, 2amps for tablets(iPads, Kindles, etc.) press the power button and VOILA, you're golden. To turn off the charger you hold down the power button for about 3 seconds, the lights turn off and you put it away in the carrying bag. To charge the pack itself I use my PowerGen dual wall outlet charger and just leave it in while I'm charging my phone from the same outlet. It's perfect! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that finds their phone running low on battery a lot when they're away from chargers and don't mind a little extra weight for an enormous amount of power.",5
"Love this portable charger, keeps my phone charged while I'm at practice so I can call my parents after! Love this thing it was so worth the money!",5
"This is a big capacity power pack charger that is a good match for the power hungry new iPads or any other tablets. It can charge smartphonesfor days and days in one full charge.It comes with an wall AC adapter that works from 100v to 240v. You can bring it with you in a different country where voltage is 220v and you won't need a transformer. It includes a micro USB cable and Galaxy Tab cable. A nice black pouch is also included.The design is very simple and attractive, it is mainly black with a blue accent. The power button incorporates the LED battery indicator showing Low, Mid or High.Cons:- the only thing I can add to this is that they should label the outputs as 1A and 2.1A instead of just Output 1 and Output 2. That way you know right away which is which.Sample item was provided by the distributor for an evaluation review.",5
It is small in size fitting easily into my gadget bag.  I have done through 6 charges and drains so far.  It will not of course fully charge my iPad 3 but i knew that going it.  It will however take it up to the high end of the charge spectrum.  I use mine mostly when out and finding a plug in is hard.  It is sleek in appearance and easy to use.  The little bag that comes with it will hold both the small adapter and extension and my iPad usb charger.,5
"A nice looking, fully-functional 12000mAh external battery pack. It has several nice features including being able to charge itself while charging an attached device, a 'smart' on-off switch that turns itself off when the attached device is disconnected, and higher-powered input/output than other units, including the 2.1A outlet indicated for tablets, and a 2A input for charging.The square shape is compact, but with a nice heft.  Interestingly it doesn't seem to weigh much more than my other much lower-capacity units.  The matte black plastic finish does pick up smudges, but is nice-looking with its blue trim and power button.  Blue LEDs indicate power level and charging activity, but can be hard to see at an angle-- with units like this, it would be nice to have more markers for charge level than 'Low Medium High'. It comes with a carry-pouch large enough to hold the unit and a couple of short USB cables.With the IMP120D fully charged, I am able to charge my Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone twice and still have the unit show 2/3 charge. This is the battery pack that goes to work with me.This kind of handy device fills the 'in transit' gap, when I'm traveling and haven't gotten to the rental car or hotel yet, but really need my quickly-draining smartphone battery to be working-- charge it up without having to stop.  It could be just as useful during commutes, especially on mass-transit where a power outlet isn't as readily available as in a car.  And after my experience with 2012's 'Derecho' storm that left vast areas of my home-state of Maryland without power for days, I also appreciate having additional ways to keep my portable devices charged, when I'm most depending on them.  I also use this unit while on the job, since having to move around a campus makes being tethered to an AC wall outlet difficult.[ I was given this product to review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product. ]I have several rechargeable battery packs, and this New Trent IMP120D is the most capable and most useful of those units.  Highly recommended.",5
"This is my first New Trent product that I owned and I must say this it is pretty impressive. Since I am meetings most of the day, I wanted an external battery for my IPhone 5. I am sure that moat of you have heard about the battery issues with the new IOS and mine was no different, therefore, I need a backup portable battery source. I have a Zagg Sparq external battery but it really does not hold its own to the New Trent IMP 120D  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:1) Similar in physical design to the Sparq. However, love the on/off switch button. In my opinion a better design feature2) Charging capacity is REALLY good. Had it the IMP 120D plugged onto my IPhone while he was playing is Basketball game (back to back) and it lasted way longer than expected3) Also liked the added pouch to store the unit as wellCons:1) The extra charging cable that I now have to carry. Wish they can somehow incorporate that into the body2) Documentation on which output to plug in when charging my IPhone. However, New Trent has the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE in my opinion. I called to ask what output to plug my IPhone into for charging.I was amazed that I actually got a person and not a recording. Within two minutes, not only did I get a answer but why I should be using Output 1 versus Output 2.Overall - the product is impressive for charging and size. I am going to try it with my other devices i.e. IPAD etc...",5
Recently took the iCarrier for a convention in NYC. We utilized square and ipad to run payment for our customers paying with a credit card. The iCarrier kept our ipad running all day. Having an electrical outlet was not an option at the convention so the iCarrier allowed us to keep our iPad on for 9 hours while running payments. Great product that impressed a lot of people at the convention!,5
"This thing is great, it's like your own little electrical mini center hassle free mobile saver, it charged my T-Mobile g2x (P999DW) fast, and fully charged of course. This product arrived within two days of when I ordered it, and its packaged good and small enough, so it fits in a mail box (people need to post about if it could fit in a mail box). I just received it, it arrived half way charged and so far I have been charging a bunch of random gadgets with it including my phone. I recommend draining it by charging stuff at first and then charging the unit (not sure if you need to do that but I rather play it safe). It should charge any high powered smart phone or any phone for that matter at least 5 to 10 times, maybe more, will see with the g2x... I'll update more... Oh the size of the charger is about the same size as a quarter pounder with cheese : p lol (I know odd comparison). One thing I wish it came with is a cable so you can charge it from a computers usb slot; or any usb slot for that matter... I'll have to see if Trent has the cable for it to buy separately",5
"I use the iCarrier to charge my iPad and my Samsung Galaxy S3. I recently went on a roadtrip and instead of buying a car charger (I was using a rental car and never really drive), I opted to get this bad boy. It charges both my devices simultaneously and is super fast.Pros:- Good look with the matte black and bright blue edges- Sturdy design- Nice little velvet pouch to hold all the cables and accessories- BIG pack, so lasts very long and charges devices for days without needing a rechargeCons:- Quite hefty. I'm in NYC and it's a walking city so I don't want to carry something so heavy around every day to charge my phone. For roadtrips or traveling, it's perfect. If you're going to be using your battery pack to charge a dying phone at the end of every day, I would suggest something smaller that can fit in your  jeans pocket. You will definitely need a jacket with big pockets or a bag in order to carry this bad boy around.- Wish the output cables were attached internally and tucked in the device (like the IMP71T). The fact that all the cables that came with it are loose and short makes me scared I'll lose them. Obviously, I'll just leave the ones I need attached and in the included pouch to prevent that.Overall, great device for anyone who is always on the go and carries around multiple gadgets that are battery drainers.",5
"I've had the IMP1000 unit for a couple of years now and thought I would review it for longevity standpoint. This unit has held its charge and dissipates at a slow rate. I usually charge it up to full and throw it in a drawer for when I need it camping, traveling, or heading out of the house for extended periods of time. It has never failed me. The only criticism I would have is that the charging level indicator (1,2,3 lights) is a little weak. Hard to tell what level it's at, but usually I don't use up the full 10,000mah because my Galaxy S4 only uses around a 2k mah battery. That's easily 4 full charges. New Trent is a great company and makes very high quality products. No cheap plastic or import feeling.",5
ive used this on a camping trip for 5 days upstate new york where there were no outlets to power up my iphone and ipad. I came through for me. i charged my ipad 3 times and my iphone5 4 times. Life saver,5
"This is my third backup battery. I travel around with an iPhone, Blackberry Bold, iPad, wireless hotspot, electronic cigarettes, and sometimes a camera.  Without this device I could not get through a whole day without one or two items going dead.  This is no longer the case. The iCarrier has more then enough reserve to charge several of these devices and keep me going the whole day.  The twin USB ports allow me to charge two devices simultaneously. The unit is very solidly built and rugged. It's also smaller then I expected. Very impressive.  I showed the unit to two friends and they ordered them the next day. Be careful if you decide to purchase other cheaper backup batteries. I did a great amount of research before purchasing this unit. After reading stories of units dead out of the box, failing in days, or even exploding and catching fire. I am happy to report that this unit meets or exceeds my expectations.  Also I received the order within 3 days using the free shipping option.  Highly recommended.",5
"I was looking for a birthday present for my father when I stumbled on the iCarrier.  He recently returned from a trip and is planning to go on another within a few weeks and I thought this would be perfect for him to use while away.  He has an iPhone and iPad2.  I played around with the iCarrier a bit to get a feel for it.Pros:Dual USB ports 2a/1a - charge tablets and smartphones simultaneously12000mAh is pretty beefy and should charge just about any device to fullEase of use - one single button - on/offAuto-shut off - Once device is full, unit shuts off to conserve batteryCons:Plastic body constuction - flexes when squeezed - will probably crack if droppedExternal charger - need to carry it with you - will not fit in carry pouch - would be better if a foldable plug was built inOnly three battery indicator lights - Low/Med/High - would be nice if it had more like the iTorch which has fiveAll in all, this is a solid portable charger that will keep your devices powered up while away from any outlets for an extended period of time.  With a few tweaks, this product would be five stars.",4
"I've had this little charger for a couple weeks and have been trying to keep track of how many times it will charge different devices, but other family members keep grabbing it to charge their own cell phones and iTouches and Kindles and they forget to record the amount of time or battery level on their devices when they started. This external battery stores more power than we have devices! So needless to say, this external battery is getting a lot of use around here.  I do know that I can charge my Kindle HD 8.9 at least twice plus my iPhone 4S three times on a charge. Plus whatever charging of iPhones and iTouches that my family members do. This external battery is nice because you can charge two different devices at the same time.The size is nice for this high capacity battery and it's molded in color finish seems to be very durable so far. It's easy to carry in a pocket, throw into a briefcase or purse and I don't feel like it's going to scratch because of the finish. It has a little blue LED light that tells you when you've turned it on and has little dot lights that give an idea of how much of a charge is left.What I end up doing often, and one reason I really like this thing, is that I don't always pay attention to charging my Kindle until I'm getting warning messages that there's only 5% of the charge left. So now, I just plug this into the Kindle and it charges while I'm reading or searching the web and I don't have to sit next to an outlet or drape wires around the room. It's a great sense of freedom for people like me who don't always remember to charge their devices when they should.A week ago I was at a trade show where we spent about 8 hours a day in a booth, with no spare electrical outlets nearby. Using the phone throughout the day ran my iPhone batteries down before the day was over. But with this Trent iCarrier External Battery, I was able to charge my phone (and those of a couple of others in my company) back up to a full charge in a short time. It's so handy to have when you travel.",5
"This thing works really well. It keeps power for a long time, and seems to actually have the amount of battery that it advertises. I'm a fan.It's a bit heavy. If that's a problem, get a smaller one. If you need the extra power, then put this in a purse or coat pocket or backpack or something. You can charge a modern smartphone (Nexus 4) about 5-6 times I found.One thing to note - the 2A socket on this thing is necessary for pretty much any phone. I found the 1A socket charged any of our smart phones too slowly. It's possible that I'm just impatient, though.",5
"I wanted a compact external battery to charge my Blackberry Torch phone as well as my Playbook tablet. This guy does the job and will power to spare. I can charge my tablet from 50% to 100% in about three hours, and still have plenty of capacity to spare. I only wish it would put out more current so my tablet would charge faster. This is a fantastic product. New Trent ROCKS!",5
"The New Trent IMP120D is an excellent value for the money.  It has a long battery life even when multiple devices are hooked up to it.  It is small enough to carry in a purse or backpack, but large enough to hold a sizeable charge.  We have carried it with us on multiple trips around the country and never had a problem. Even after sitting for several months, it remains charged for the next trip.  We have used it on several trips to Disney and it charges our phones for us while we are in the parks without it having to be recharged every day.  If you are looking for an external battery with a large charging capacity and ease of use, this New Trent is for you!",5
"Delivery timeThe product arrived at my door within two days with Amazon Prime shipping. The product came bundle with another item I purchased in your typical brown Amazon box packaged with air bag protection.PackagingThe NEWTRENT iCarrier IMP120D 12,000mAh capacity box was wrapped in a plastic covering taped with a warranty label, warning the product holder to sign up the product for the warranty. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you see the package. It is sleek and informative. If you have a problem as soon as the product arrives, you don&#8217;t even have to open the box as the website, telephone number, and support link are under the box. The box also lists product specs, and items inside.Inside the box were the user manual, micro-USB cable, soft pouch, which felt kind of rough, and of course, the iCarrier, which where all nice snugged in its plastic mold.Look and feelThe iCarrier itself does look modern and sleek. Although the unit looks bulky, it has no weight to it, which is nice. Hard plastic feels like the kind that you&#8217;ll see in lower-end car dashboards.I set out to test the matte black finish of the iCarrier. With hands that were just washed with soap (read: oil free), the iCarrier does every so often retain fingerprint/residue. However, you can be confident that matte black doesn&#8217;t age quickly.Manual & first chargeThe manual folds out to a few pages from left to right and is a bit small, simple and to the point. What you don&#8217;t see very often are the office hours on a manual which NEWTRENT has on the first page. The second page lists the product specs and box contents. NEWTRENT does not label the micro-USB cable as the iCarrier&#8217;s charger, but refers to it as a &#8220;charging cable for Android smartphones.&#8221; The next couple of pages illustrate the products different ports, button, and indicator lights. A page illustrates charging the iCarrier using a wall charger (not included) or via a PC. The How To Use page has a sentence describing how to initiated the charging process and another sentence and pictures stating compatibility with devices. The last page illustrates and describes safety and maintenance.The wall charger I&#8217;m about to use to charge the iCarrier states an output of 5V and 1 Amp. The charging port states that it can flow as much as 1.5 Amp. Neither the manual nor the box mentions anything about the iCarrier being pre-charged, however, as soon as I plugged my wall charger to the iCarrier, it started showing a ring of three blue led lights, and the proceeded down to one lit blue led. Most, if not all rechargeable electronics have an auto-stop charge mechanism which I&#8217;m hoping the iCarrier does too because I&#8217;m about to leave it plugged for about 4 hours. A few hours into charging, I checked for temperature and the battery is not hot or warm at all. I wake up to a full ring of three led lights that are steady and not blinking.TestingI start out simultaneously charging two of my devices: a Samsung Galaxy S4 and my HP Touchpad (yes, I still use it!). When the 2.1 USB port was free, I charged my current phone, the Galaxy S4. Now, the HP Touchpad require more output then other tablets and smartphones out there, that&#8217;s what the Touchpad came with its own A/C wall charger that outputs 5.3v. Later on the day, I used up some juice on my primary phone and charged it again. I also found a 2nd battery of the camera so I charged that as well.Charging performance is reasonable for the 1A port and fast on the 2.1A port. The manual advises charging bigger devices like tablets with the 2.1A port. The S4 had 50% battery charge when I started charging it with the iCarrier&#8217;s 2.1A port &#8211; finished charging after about 50 minutes. The HP Touchpad 4G had no battery charge when I plugged it into the 2.1A port &#8211; finished charging in about 2hrs. The Zune HD started out with about half its battery charge and was plugged in the 2.1A port. After about 30 minutes it was charged.  The camera&#8217;s 600mAh battery charged in about 1.5 hours on the 1A port. Even after all these devices charging, the iCarrier is showed two blue LED meaning 1/3 of the battery was used.A few observations: while using both ports to charge, no significant heat can be felt. Likewise, while charging the iCarrier, no significant heat is generated. The iCarrier turns itself off as soon as a device is fully charged. NOTE: The unit was charged using USB A/C wall charger of 5.3v that came with my HP Touchpad.I did test the unit charging it via USB 2.0. After 8hrs, it was not completely charged. Tough, my computer was in sleep mode, so that could result in the slow charging.Final thoughtsThe IMP120D is a great all-day-out companion and has enough juice to charge a small family of devices, and some. Reason for purchase was to take it with me to San Diego as I went on 5-day crazy adventure known as Comic-Con. Although portable, this does not fit in your pocket. But, perfect for backpack or travel bags. The package came as advertised and performed great. I wish I had enough time to find out how many devices I can charge until it runs out of juice and so I can find out how long the iCarrier&#8217;s charge time would be from empty.Charging test devices:Samsung Galaxy S4 16GBHP Touchpad 16GBNikon Coolpix P310Zune HD 32GB",5
"I recently purchased the New Trent IMP120D to help me keep my devices powered while traveling across the country for work. After traveling on 10 hour flights, I was tired of having my iPhone and iPad's batteries drained by the time I reached my destination. There is nothing worse than landing in a new city and having no battery life to help you navigate the unfamiliar territory.With my new battery pack I can not only have the amount of battery life I need to make it through a heavy use day, but the amount of space in my small carry on isn't wasted with a big and bulky item.The battery pack comes with two USB outputs, one at 1A and the other at 2.1A. I needed a battery pack that would allow me to plug in multiple USB devices at a time, as well as utilize different USB cords that I have. I have been able to charge my iPhone, iPad, Gameboy, and Bluetooth headset all well still being able to use the devices as they charge.Another nice feature is the light weight this product has. After a morning of heavy use while taking pictures and surfing the web, my iPhone's battery was nearly dead. Not wanting to leave my phone in the hotel room while I went to dinner, I simply put the battery pack in my cargo shorts pocket and it never bothered me toting around with it in my pocket.Something I found really impressive was the battery pack's logic to shut off power to charging my devices once they reached a full charge. Rather than continually charging my phone, it simply switched off when my phone reached 100%.The only complaint I have after 2 weeks of use was the little bag that comes with the device. The drawstring came out shortly after arriving making the bag worthless, but that didn't bother me too much since I had another bag that I was able to store the pack as well as all my USB cords.I have only had the battery pack for two weeks of use, but it has really helped me out. Traveling a lot on airplanes and airports where finding outlets can be difficult this has been a lifesaver. It'll always travel with me from now on.",5
For some reason the battery pack did not work at first. Now it seems to be working fine I charged it fullyat first However it didn't work. Now it is fine,4
"First off, I trust New Trent. Second, this is my 3rd New Trent battery pack. Not because of problems, but because of the multiple needs. Between me and my family members we have 3 iPhones, 1 iPod Touch, a Garmin, and 2 tablets. I was pleasantly surprised when I chose this IMP1000 battery pack, and then saw an offer to purchase it's smaller brother, the one with 6000 mAh. So, I went ahead and purchased both. After all was said and done, I paid $90 for 2 battery packs. The local electronic store, (no names given for 'Worst Buy'), would have cost me $79 plus tax for another so-called battery pack which is so-called good, but doesn't have the right mJuice I need. Anyway, back to the review here.First off, 2 usb ports is an awesome thing. Second, 12000 mAh means you can charge an iPhone 4 almost 10 times over before running out of power on this. Or, it means you can charge 2 iPhones at the same time, around 5 times over. Even though it's not very thin, considering how much power this holds, it's no surprise. I used to have the IMP880, and really liked it, except that its AC wall charger's cable went bad and it required me to wrap electric tape around it. Hopefully the wall charger for this one will last me a bit longer.What I find very cool is that even if you are blind, (like me), you don't need to rely on the lights to tell you if it's doing it's job. You simply connect your iPhone to it, press the power button for a few seconds, and voile, when your iPhone plays the alert tone that it's charging, you know it's on. Of course the experience may be different if your iPhone is totally dead. Also, when you are done using it, all you need to do is disconnect it, and it turns off all on its own. Some reviewers have made comments about how bright the lights are when charging your device. I'm happy to say that it presents no problems in my case. :-)Over all, I highly recommend this battery pack.",5
"then this is your unit.  Having more than 3x to 5x the charge of most phones or tablets. this nice little unit will run your device long after the stated battery life.  And yet it is compact and not too heavy.  Comes with adapter for different charging USB plug sizes and a round charging plug that fits my tablet.  Makes those 20+ hour plane rides with kids a breeze (movies, games on the tablet and phone).",5
"Wow!  This really did work the way they said it would.  Was on a 6 hour fight to Kaua'i, watched two full movies on my ipad as this was hooked up.  It completely recharged the ipad.  I highly recommend this product.",5
"I have had my IMP120D iCarrier for a few weeks and I have found it to be a excellent replacement for my IMP99D iGeek battery pack. My wife has gotten my iGeek and I hope she likes it as much as I did. With the iCarrier I can power my iPad, Samsung Galaxy S3, and my Amazon Kindle HD through an entire dialysis session without a worry of losing power. Before I had to choose which one I would let run out of power if I had forgotten to charge my electronic goodies before going to dialysis. But with the 12000mAh of stored power, I no longer have to choose. I can even offer to charge other peoples devices.It is light and simple to use. Honestly the hardest part about using it is remembering to plug it in so it gets a chance to charge before you need it. And lots of time there is enough charge to get me thru an session without charging it. I have bad vision in my right eye and none in my left. I find the indicators to be large enough for me to use.After you start using these battery pack, you are going to find yourself unable to do without them. Unlike a lot of products on the market today it does what is meant to do and does it well...",5
"The New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 is a quality product.  It works very well and as described.  I hesitated spending so much money for what is esssentailly a portable external battery, but this device is worth it.  I looked at (and even bought a couple) of those cheap chargers and they are OK with iPods, but most do not charge an iPad2 battery and some of them take forever to load up.The New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 does it all.  I have charged up both my iPad2 and my iPod Touch with this thing and have been satisfied with how it works and the quality of the build.  It is somewhat larger than the 'cheapies', but not so big it can't be easily packed in my luggage or carried in my travel vest.It comes with neat velvet case and a number of adapters for various devices.  However, there is no iPod/iPad cable included.  The standard iPod/iPad cable works just fine and I have a number of those lying around.  There is a charger included.When I leave for Europe on one of my trips with my iPad2 I have the New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 along too.  A ten hour transatlantic flight requires some extra juice for my iPad2 and the IMP1000 is just the ticket.  Using the thing is like extending the iPad2 battery life dramatically.I can recommend the New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 without hesitation.",5
A few old timers like myself are constantly looking for something that works out of the box when  one understand very little about computers. My previous attempt to use a backup was a waste of time and money.The product might have been great but I didn't understand how to use it.The New Trent connects and you follow the instruction on the screen.I have three computers backed up.If ease of use is important I would recommend this highly.,5
I purchased the NEWTRENT external battery pack for use while at my son's all-day robotic competition.  I was able to charge I-Phone while at the event and the battery pack still had plenty of charge according to the LED indicator.  I recommend this item for anyone whom needs to charge any mobile device while away on businees and on vacation.,5
"After debating on buying an extended battery for my device, I opted for the IMP1000, as it allows me to power more devices. I had no problem powering my iPad 2 with it. Not sure why someone else said they having a problem. This item works flawlessly, and would highly recommend it. I had used mine recently on a cross country trip, and believe me, I was smiling ear to ear when I saw other people at the airport fighting to get a wall outlet for a delayed flight. I was sitting peacefully in my corner watching movies while charging my device, and had no issues with over-heating or anything else.One thing to note: when I got my iCruiser, I was real worried about the packaging. My packaging was all torn up, and what made my heart sink, was when I opened the box, it looked like someone had used it before me. There were finger prints that were on the device, and I had a missing cable. Not a big deal for me, as I usually have extra cables, but definitely not something I want to see when buying a &79 device.I hope this battery lasts a long time, as I really like it. Size is good, its not massive, more like a deck of cards.If you need something to keep your hungry electronics powered this is the best bet. The money you would put down for one extended battery for one device could be better used on this type of external battery, in which you can power more devices with only one battery.",5
"Needed to run Kodak Zi8 cameras across a full day of field research, and the New Trent Extreme battery did the trick, providing 13 hours or so of operation where the Zi8 internal battery only provides about 90-100 minutes.  Tried some of the ~5000 mAh devices, and these did not provide enough run time for our research, though they did extend recording time way past the built-in battery.Size is reasonable for the extreme amount of portable power you are getting.  I am sure I could recharge my cell phone for a week on this device before needing to hit an AC tap.I like the build quality, gloss finish, and simple operation as well.Two wish-fors*Charge the device via USB-in instead of proprietary charger*Higher amperage output, for devices that require it.  The Extreme puts out 1A, twice the USB 1/2 standard, but still not enough for some power hungry portable devices.For every day use, I really like the ~5000 mAh SatechiSatechi iCel 4800 mAh (2 amp) Battery Extender Pack and Charger for iPhone 4, 3G & 3Gs, iPod Touch 4G, BlackBerry, HTC EVO, DROID, Samsung Galaxy S, Kindle DX, Flip & Vado HD Camcorders, as it is MUCH smaller, AND supports 2A output.  This will recharge my Storm 2 2-3 times before needing recharge itself.But if you really need a lot of power in a small package, more than the 5000 mAh devices can provide, the Extreme is a great choice.",5
"This battery is smaller then some others.  But It recharges my I phone 5 , about 3 - 4 times . . . . .",5
"The New Trent iCarrier 12,000 mAh Dual USB External Battery is a great device to have along on long trips. It claims to be good for about 500 charge cycles (I am nowhere near that) and I can believe it as so far it has worked flawlessly. As an airline pilot I travel a lot and there are times when I need the ability to charge a USB device without access to AC power. Not only can this gem charge one, it can charge two USB devices at once to include phones and tablets (and most other devices using a 5V USB input.)The unit is compact, just a bit bigger than a pack of cards making it easy to stow in even the smallest luggage, although it's modestly heavy as it is after all essentially a quite dense Lithium polymer battery. Despite the added weight in my bag, I generally take this with me on trips and like the flexibility it gives me. There are a bunch of statistics about what it can do on the box (e.g. &#34;up to an additional 50 hours of video playtime,&#34; etc.) and I have no doubt that they are accurate, but the real point is that I have never come close to completely depleting the charge in mine. It does come with a USB charging cable and a carrying pouch, though not an AC wall adapter.I use mine for a mix of devices, but probably most for my iPhone 5. New Trent recommends that you use it only with original Apple cables. I don't know how critical that is, but I have done so with no problems. The unit has worked flawlessly for me and is intuitive to use (it does have an incredibly brief instructional manual included, but you probably won't need it.) If you don't mind a bit of added weight in your bag (remember not to put it in checked luggage on a plane) I think the utility of this battery more than makes up for the inconvenience of carrying yet another electronic device.",5
"this product seems like a god send from first impressions - well built, good travel size, and dual ports - one for iphone and one with more juice, for say an ipad. however, I would be careful and not switch ports between devices either intentionally or inadvertently. I plugged my ipad into the (lower) voltage slot by mistake last week and now it has trouble charging - using its own 30 pin power cord. can't be certain if this battery pack was the cause, but would nevertheless proceed with caution!",3
"I received the new updated model (with the micro USB input for charging).  No longer do you need to carry 2 separate cords, and the charging cord is readily available should you lose/forget it.When I first got it, I checked the user manual for the input amperage restrictions. I didn't see any specific restrictions so I connected it to my 2.1A port on my charger at night and left it overnight. When I woke up in the morning it was fully charged.I let my smartphone run nearly dead that night.  I then connected it to the New Trent IMP120D.  It charged in the usual time.  Then I connected my tablet at the same time.  Amazing to see a portable battery device that can charge both devices without skipping a beat. Unfortunately I rarely get my tablet get too low, so I was mostly doing 'top offs' with this battery and my tablet.The ports are nice and solid and feel like they will last a long time.The case or shell has a spot that does not feel so solid, but I guess I will be careful not to ever press on that spot too hard.I like the use of the mini LED lights for power on indication and charge level, but I do not like how they bleed through the edges.  This makes it difficult to tell at night what level the battery is at.  Sometimes in the light it is difficult to tell as well.While I know they don't advertise it for keeping in your pocket, I do keep mine in my pocket.  It's barely noticeable, at least to me anyways.  This means I always have portable power on hand for my device or my family and friends' devices.All in all, I love this device.",5
"I rate the IMP1000 External Battery Pack at 5 stars.  I live in the North East and just went through a lengthy power outage at my home from Hurricane Irene. We were so frightened from the strong winds and I was terrified of losing communication.  Thanks to my IMP1000 I was able to recharge my Droid smart phone and itouch's over a period of several days and it still had a charge left.  It enabled me and my family to keep in touch with the power company and local news. I did not realize how important this item was going to be.  Originally, I only thought of it as a convenience. We used it to charge up my Droid smartphone, two other cell phones and 4 ipod touch's. It is amazingly easy to use. It's compact and came with a variety of adapters so it fit all of my electronic items.",5
"My new samsung galaxy s4 uses 2amp charging which goes with this battery back up perfectly. Its a power hungry device but when charging off this can charge to full in less than an hour and a half, sometimes faster depending on phone usage while its charging.Pros: Huge capacity, small spacecons: My model charges by AC adapter but apparently the newer models charge by micro USB which is even better, Im extremely tempted to get another!",4
"Everything about the battery is exactly as advertised and it works great. My only problem is that it is too much of a good thing. It is just a little too heavy to carry in a jacket pocket, especially when you add a phone to the same pocket. I've also tried the New Trent 7000mAh battery is for me it strikes a much better balance of weight and capacity. Both will charge a phone more than once and both will give an iPad a big boost, but the 7000 and a phone can be combined in a pocket without looking lopsided while the 12000 is just a little too much. That said if you are looking at an international flight without in seat power, or all day at a trade show where you are more or less tethered to one location without power then portability is less of an issue and capacity wins out.",4
"I have bought this product for my own use, and I have given the IMP120D as a gift at least four times in the past. They are easy to use and reliable. The capacity for the given size is great, and I wouldn't want to be without one any time I leave the house for any extended period. The IMP120D is a 5 out of 5.",5
"As an owner of other New Trent products, I knew what to expect when I ordered the IMP120D, and I wasn't dissapointed. It's a strong, sturdy product with nice design and performs as advertised. 12000mAh is an amazing capacity to fit into a portable charger this size - you can charge your gadgets multiple times before needing to recharge this thing.I have an iPhone and an iPad, so the dual ports are perfect for simultaneously charging both. The 12000mAH is huge, especially compared to other portable chargers. I've had several chargers and this is easily the most powerful one i've owned. It can COMPLETELY charge my iPad 2, which is asking a lot from a portable charger. I have a charger that's 7000mAh - it's strong but it will only charge my iPad 2 to about 70% from dead. Not only will this one charge it fully, it has enough power remaining to charge my iPhone.The design is very modern - soft curved edges and very sleek. The power button is in a location that seems difficult to accidentally press. New Trent made this button slightly recessed in its location, but its still easy to locate. I haven't had any issues with the button being pressed on accident and i've shoved this thing in bookbags and tossed it around haphazardly. The charge status is easy to read as well - low, medium and high tells you how much remaining power on the device. Simple enough. It lights up when its in use, so its easy to glance at it and verify its doing its job.It was surprised by how heavy it is, especially for a device that looks so small. It's significantly heavier than other chargers, but that is to be expected with 12000maH. Its a size that can fit a lot of pockets and sleeves if you're on the go. It would fit in your pants pocket, but probably wouldn't be comfortable. It's still smaller than George Costanza's wallet.I'm very happy with the IMP120D. For now, I have it plugged next to my bed and use it to charge my devices at night. But its also good to know that I can throw it in my bookbag when i'm traveling and not have to worry about charging it for a long time.",5
"I've only had it a few weeks, but I gave it to my fianc&eacute; to test as she sometimes forgets to charge her Galaxy S3 overnight - She was very happy with it and has claimed it as her own, however she would rather have my NT120T as it's a little more compact & lighter...",5
"This product works perfectly for the purpose advertised.  I have charged my droid razr maxx, ipod nano 5th gen, and iphone 4 with no issues at all.  It's simple to use.  Basically, you charge the battery pack and forget about charging it for a long time. Then you can carry the portable pack with you anywhere you would need to charge your portable devices.  It has dual usb ports making the battery capable of charging two devices at one time.  As an example, I have used it at a camping trip and on a long plane ride where i had to charge my ipod on the plane.  Highly recommend.",5
"I have no complaints about this gadget. It does what it's supposed to do. A+ since it carries a charge for a long time, and we were able to charge two iPhones for about two days without recharging the device.",5
"tem of excellent quality and I think it's GalletDespite its high price is a wonderful device, and the best devices that buy it and it's still working IThank you Amazon wish diversification in goods displayedThank you",5
"Pros:  small and lightweight; charges devices very quickly -- faster than the AC chargers.Cons:  LEDs are small and not easy to see.Recommendations:This is a great charger!  It charges devices very quickly -- much faster that the OEM supplied AC charger.  A few minor disadvantages are: (1) it is not possible to know when the device is fully charged.  The LED light flashes, but never comes on steady.  (2) When charging a device, the user must push the power button to see how much charge remains on the battery.  Those are minor issues that do not affect the overall performance.  Highly recommend this charger!",5
"I live in southern New Jersey and ended up dead center in a freak storm that left me without power for five days.  After that, I became determined not to lose power to my cellphone again.  I have only used the charger once to test it and it worked well and fairly quickly.  I just leave it plugged in all of the time. Ready to go in an emergency.  Now that I've added an iPad to my electronics, I'm sure I'll be using the charger.  I would have given it 4.5 stars but that's not an option.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I find it a bit heavy to carry around in my handbag.",4
"I have been using the IMP120D for the past year. It has performed exceptionally well to power my iPhone and iPad during travel, power outages, or when a power outlet is not convenient. The battery life is excellent, and has not deteriorated after being recharged many times. The size and weight make the device easy to pack for travel. I rate this device a 5 without hesitation, and do not dislike anything about it.",5
"I have used this item for a weekend trip and I still wasn't able to use the entire battery up!  We have 4 iPhones in our family (all 4s) and we were able to keep charging our phones for a 3 day weekend and I still had maybe 20% left.  When we charged our phones, the battery was roughly 30% before charging.  I didn't try to charge my iPad (actually forgot to bring my lightning cable) so I cannot attest to that, but I am sure that it would have worked perfectly for it to.  Here are my pros / cons:Pros:Massive amounts of battery!Relatively small size (but could be smaller as compare to some other batteries listed on amazon)Dual USB portsIncluded AC AdapterCons:The iGeek model as 4 separate battery status lights...why can't you do that for this model?Bulky (see above)Would have been nice to have a micro USB input (for charging) so that I could use my Apple AC 12W Adapter (I hate to carry multiple AC adapters with me)",4
"I previously wasted money on 2 lipstick chargers that were advertised as being useful for charging smartphones, if they provided any functionality I could not tell. I used this to charge my own phone and my Brother in Law's phone at the same time and he has told me he will be buying one very soon. I never go anywhere without mine.",5
Does everything advertised. Has plenty of power to charge my iphone 5 and ipad multiple times. This is nice so you dont have to recharge the battery after every use,5
"This iCarrier is an easy 5 stars. It's high ratings are well justified.Pros: Plenty of them, I'll list a few obvious ones.- Extremely easy to use (One-button operation, this is how devices should be made!)- Dual Ports (Trent does this best!)- Sleek matte finish, Professional appearance (This is a big reason why I keep buying New Trent stuff)- Durable (While it looks great, it is also very sturdy.)- Very accurate & consistent charging (Charging is spot-on as advertised, and in my opinion, even better than what they claimed.)Cons: Not very many. Truth is, it's the best portable charging device out there at this point.- Requires use of external wall charger. (I was spoiled by the New Trent iTorch only requiring a USB cable! I do understand that a wall charger is safer though and protects the device over the course of its life.)- More backpack friendly, than 'pocket friendly' (Be sure to wear a belt if you're walking around with it in your pants! :-)- Slippery (Would be nice if it had sponge pads or 'legs' on one side to give it some grip when on a table.)My Review:I bought the iCarrier for my iPad 3 a few weeks after picking up the iTorch for my iPhone 5. I realized I would need something with more power to charge my iPad 3, as well as my iPhone while traveling.Even when not traveling, I wanted something which could charge more devices at once,  and also serve as a 'surge' protector during storms/winter season. Rather than sit here next week when Hurricane Sandy comes by, I'll be ready to put my iCarrier to work! I can charge up an iPhone between 5-6 times before I sit there twiddling my thumbs in the dark not knowing what to do.That being said I've tested out the iCarrier with both my iPhone 5 and iPad 3.Test 1: iPhone 5On the iCarrier you will see 2 outputs. Output 1 is meant for the phones and iPods while the Output 2 is meant for the iPad. Being impatient, I decided to just do an 'off-label' experiment and use my iPhone 5 and plugged it into Output 2. Surely enough the iPhone 5 actually charged faster than a regular wall charger. It charged from 0% to 100% in 1.5 hours. The phone DID NOT heat up, and neither did my iCarrier.Test 2: iPad 3Now, although the iPad 3's battery is somewhere around 11,000 mAh, and the iCarrier is around 12,000 mAh - I knew that with any charging device there would be a slight bit of `wasting' of power. This was also indicated by Trent as they expected the iPad 3 to charge up to 80%. I would say this is accurate. Mine charged up to 77%...I believe the ~3% difference was because I had the device on (wasn't using it) and Wi-Fi was on the entire time. Considering this, I am very impressed with its charging capability. I did note that the end part which was plugged into the iCarrier of the Apple USB cable did warm up as did the iCarrier when charging my iPad 3. It was not extensive enough to cause worry but it was warmer than normal, in my opinion.Suggestions/Improvements:1. Decrease weight and possibly change shape to a more ergonomic design. - This is with all technology improvements. New Trent is way ahead of the game, and to stay ahead of the game I am sure they will improve on this as technology as a whole improves across the board. Once again, I was spoiled by the iTorch's ergonomic design, the iCarrier is more of a 'good looking charging brick'.2. Digital display for battery remaining, and during re-charging - It'd be nice to know how much battery is left with more accuracy. This might increase the cost, so maybe in a more 'premium' model.3. Foam/rubber pads for one side. To prevent it from slipping off a table, the velvet carrying bag isn't really necessary.4. Auto-Shut Off both when charging devices and when re-charging itself (This may already be there, I'm not sure...I will Update my review if I realize this feature is on it. I forgot to check this earlier.)5. Built-in Charging Prongs - For those dire moments when you need to get a charge-in but can't carry the wall charger on you.In summary: If you own a tablet, buy it. If you have multiple iPhones or Android phones at home, buy it. Expecting any Travel/Hurricans/Snow Storms/Power Outages...buy it. I will have mine fully charged up next week as Hurrican Sandy hits, and then once again when I head out to Vegas. This iCarrier will be getting some serious usage in the coming days!",5
"The iCarrier battery pack is great. I use it when I travel to Australia. It recharged and IPad, Iphone, Google Nexxus Tablet, and a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone during the trip and still had 50% capacity remaining. The charger fit easily into my carry-on bag and using it on the plane was a breeze. The unit is simple to operate, plug in cables and turn it on. The only thing that I found annoying was that the case of the battery charger was slippery, when left on the drop-down tray of the airplane seat, it would slide around too easily. I am going to put a thin piece of high density rubber in the carry bag so I can rest it on that while in the airplane seat. The LED capacity lights are helpful but would be nice if they were a bit larger.",4
"This thing is a beast of a battery that will charge your phone more times in a day than you could possibly use it, unless you play a game with your phone set at max brightness you're not going to sip all of the juice from this battery in a single day, with 12,000 mAh of battery it charges my S3 about 5 times and then some and that's more than enough to last a weekend in the wilderness (not that you'd bring your phone along..) or if you just have those long days where you need an extra charge - this will do the trick, and if you're coming from full charge you won't be needing to recharge it everynight if you need to use it consecutively for long days.Also, its pretty 'neat' that it has two USB ports, so you can charge two devices at once, this functions just fine while charging my Zune HD and my Phone as the same time.My only real discrepancy is that this thing isn't really pocketfriendly material, in that its wide - its something that looks like you'd throw in a bag or backpack for spare charging versus your pocket, its portable most definitely but not pocketable in every scenario.",4
"The New Trent line of external batteries and charging devices are great products.Reliable , and with a great diversity of gear, you can have all power recharging needs met to your exact needs.This model, the iCarrier, is lightweight with a smooth, pleasant finish to it. Low key yet easily  visible LEDs tell you how much of a charge you have left.The device is powered up over night and comes with its own plug in AC wall cord and 2 USB cables, for the standard Droid and the Samsung Galaxy phones. i just finished draining it completely, and i got about 36 mixed hours of Droid phone and Internet browsing off the first week.Great for a phone that wont be near a wall outlet for 2 or 3 days. The double USB charge option is handy if you got couple devices...Definitely worth it for a multi device family!",5
"I have many mobile devices and tested this NewTrent iCarrier 12000mAH charger on all of them. It charged the following: Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy S3, iPhone 4, iPhone 3G, original iPhone (2G), original iPad, and Motorola SD10-HD bluetooth headset. I charged my Galaxy S3, Note 2, and iPhone 4 multiple times on a single charge.Overview:The iCarrier comes with a wall charger, a soft pouch for storage, a 24.5' USB to microUSB cable, and a 7.5' 'Galaxy Tab Converter Cable/Samsung Galaxy Tab Charging cable'. One note about this 'Galaxy Tab Converter Cable': On the box it is described as a 'Galaxy Tab Converter Cable'. However, on the cable there is a sticker that describes it as a 'Samsung Galaxy Tab Charging cable'. I don't have a Galaxy Tab, so I was unable to test this cable.The iCarrier has two outputs labeled 'Output 1' and 'Output 2'. Output 1 is 5V/1A and Output 2 is 5V/2.1A (according to the manual). The Power On/Off button has blue LEDs used for various purposes, which I will describe later in this review. One thing I like about these LEDs is that they aren't too bright. I have some devices with blue LEDs that are annoyingly bright. Not so for the iCarrier.LEDs:When the iCarrier is connected to a power outlet, the three LEDs cycle from Low, Mid, to High, indicating the iCarrier is being charged.  When fully charged, all three LEDs stay lit while the power cable is connected.  Once the power cable is disconnected, the LEDs go off and the device is powered off.  If you power the device on, the LEDs will light up to indicate the current level of charge (Low, Mid, or High).  After 30 seconds the LEDs will go off and the iCarrier will power off, if you're not charging anything.  During charging, the power button LED remains on.  To view the battery level while charging, click the power button.  The battery level indicator LEDs will light up for 30 seconds.Operation:To charge other devices, first turn on the iCarrier by holding the power button down for about a second. The iCarrier has three blue LEDs lit: Low, Mid, and High, that will indicate the current battery level of the iCarrier. Connect your device(s) to Output 1 and/or Output 2. You can charge multiple devices at the same time.Field Test:I ran a special test with the iPad (1st generation), since it has the largest battery of all my mobile devices. First, I fully charged the iCarrier and I fully depleted the battery on my iPad, taking it down to 0%. Next, I disconnected the power supply from the iCarrier, turned it on, then connected the iPad to Output 1 (1 Amp). It took 6.5 hours to fully charge the iPad, I checked it every 30 minutes. The iPad gained 8% every 30 minutes, with no variation until it was 100% charged. At this point the iCarrier still showed it had a 'Mid' charge.I tested charging the iPad while connected to Output 2 (2 Amp). It charges even faster. I was able to fully charge my iPad in 4 hours 5 minutes.  The battery level on the iCarrier still indicated a 'Mid' charge remaining.Bottom Line:This is a great little portable battery that can recharge just about anything with a USB cable. It has a huge battery capacity with multiple charging ports, 2 Amp and 1 Amp. I would recommend this to anyone.",5
"I purchased this because my cell phone battery constantly goes down and I need portable access to charge it.  I take this New Trent External Battery EVERYWHERE.  I keep it in my purse so it's available whenever I need it, and believe me,  I have needed it several times.  It works wonders.  Once it's fully charged, I can then charge my IPhone and/or my tablet (or both at the same time).  I have charged my items several times without having to recharge the External Battery again.  It's really good for long trips where an electric socket isn't available.  I enjoyed mine so much that I ordered 4 additional ones and gave them out as gifts because my friends kept asking to borrow mine!  The New Trent ICarrier 12000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery is a life savor for me.  I highly recommend it.",5
Very good quality. The battery lasts pretty long. It's kinda big to put into pocket but overall its worth it if you use your phone a lot.,5
Took this with me on a 2 week camping trip and it charged my phone (which I kept off most of the time anyway) and iPod several times along with a freinds phone and iPod. It's been almost a year that I've had it and it's still got some charge! It's very small and light. Easy to take with you!,5
"I wasn't for sure if this battery pack would charge all my electronics, but I was very surprised when I put it to the test.  I use it to charge my kindle fire, HP Touchpad, HTC Incredible, and my mifi-WiFi device.  I never kept track of actually how long a full charge has lasted me, but I use it back to back over many days and it has held a charge and I was able to use it when I needed it, especially just charging my smartphone it could be a week or more.I loved it so much, I also purchased the IMP99D model that is 9900 mah.  I purchased this model due to the 2 USB ports and the fact I can just keep it in my handbag at all times, so I can charge my phone and mifi at the same time, or charge my kindle fire and juice up my mifi at the same time while on the go, since I keep these items in my handbag most times.*by the way, the IMP99D and the IMP1000 feels very close in weight, but the IMP99D is just a little smaller in sizeHaving both units provides me a piece of mind that I will always have a battery backup power pack ready to use while the other one may be recharging itself at home in the wall socket or via an inverter in a motor vehicle.  It's a must have in my case.I love these packs, and I found out more recently that New Trent has come out with a 12000 mah unit called the iCarrier with 2 USB ports.  Awesome!",5
"If you're familiar with New Trent's line of external batteries, then you know how this product works.  You simply plug in your device into one of two USB ports and turn it on.  Your device will start charging immediately.  What's really nice is that if you don't use it very often, you don't need to worry about it losing it's charge quickly.  About a month went by after I initially charged it up before I first used it, and it still indicated that it had a full charge.This particular model differs from the older New Trent external batteries...1. Very high capacity (12000mAh).  But you sacrifice size for that much capacity.  It's much thicker... over 1' thick.2. Mini-USB port for charging.  While this is nice since previous external batteries from New Trent used a proprietary connection, this means that you'll likely need to carry around an extra USB cable if your device uses micro USB (just about any not made by Apple).3. Higher amperage USB ports.  One port is 1A, while the other is 2.1A.  This is significant as this means that it should have no problem charging any mobile device.This comes with a mini-USB cable as well as a small pouch to carry both the battery and the cable.I haven't had this product very long (only a few months), so I cannot comment on the longevity of it or customer support (although from what I've read, they are very responsive to any issues).",5
I have been using this for about a week now. Here are my pros and cons thus far:Pros:Great battery lifeAbility to charge two devices at one timeSmall and compactEasy to re-chargeCons:A little heavier than what I expecting but understandable due to the great battery capacityiPad 3 charging time was not greatOverall for the price I paid it definitely is a step up compared to the Mophie Juice Pack.,4
"I purchased this product during the height of hurricaine Sandy in anticipation for future blackouts.  Thankfully I didn't need it this time but since blackouts seems to be frequent, I am prepared for the next.  I used it to charge my iPhone and it was quick, however when I used it for my iPad it was slower.  I was told by the company that output 2 would work better for the iPad, but unfortunately that output isn't working. However, I am in contact with customer service and they will be arranging a replacement.",4
"This is a great device for people who travel or are away from an outlet for long periods of time and you need to charge on the go or even for emergencies. I can name at least a dozen times in the past my phone has died because I forgot to let it charge the day before. That never will happen as long as I have this with me. Last, it's always nice to have a backup plan when you like going camping/hiking etc&#8230;Pros:1. This will fully charge any device on the go when you're not near an outlet2. Indicators that let you know the battery charge level3. Has 2 USB ports so you can charge 2 devices at once. I confirmed this by charging my IPAD and my Android phone without any problem.4. Great device to keep in your car in case of emergencies5. You can watch movies without the fear of your device dying.6. Fully charged my IPAD (from 40%) in 4 hours while using it.Cons:1. It comes with a cord to convert the Iphone/Samsun chargers, but I would like it better if it was possible to just have the converter on the device itself (like a USB slot meant for just this and then 2 normal USB slots). The less I have to carry with me the better.",4
"We travel abroad extensively and I have found that we are not always in places where a wall outlet is readily available.  I just purchased the iCarrier 12000mAh for this summers South East Asia and India trip hoping to be able to solve the issues of 26 hour train rides with no charging opportunities but great photographic opportunities. I have been testing the iCarrier at home by charging our ipads, iphones, itouches and even charging camera battery packs.  So far, the charge is faster than the wall charge for all the items.  The iCarrier is small, but a bit on the heavy side, it is very intuitive-just the on/off button with the low/med/high signal, the AC charging port and 2USB ports.  I am looking foward to the security of always having the availability to charge my devices.  I will complete the review after the trip.",5
"This is a great battery pack. It charges phones/tablets very quickly. Thedevice itself holds a charge for a long time so I can use it for multipledevices if I need to. The device itself also charges fast so I can grab itand go when I need it. The size isn't bad for a large battery pack likethis. I've had others similar to this and the sizes are very comparable.This is great for traveling or emergency situations when I need to power adevice before it dies.My only minor complaint is that you have to charge the battery pack via theincluded charger. It would be nice if this was a standard USB port that youcould charge it with. As someone who travels frequently I like to pack asfew chargers as possible. Being able to charge this via USB would allow meto carry a single wall USB charger and a few cables to charge all of mydevices, including the battery pack.Otherwise, this is a great back and I will continue to use it often. It iswell built and I can tell it will last me a long time.",4
"We purchased last year and were very pleased with a New Trent IMP50D which provided multiple charges for smart phones and a Kindle Fire. Purchased the iCarrier 1200 for its larger capacity and dual ports since we added a Nook HD to our list of devices that we travel with. We have been using the new one for the past few weeks and it is working well with good recharging speed and multiple item capability. I recommend this product to anyone who needs a portable charging device, particularly suited for travelers overseas.",5
"I have many back-up batteries, and this IMP 1000 is the best and biggest.  On a trip to Mexico this thing powered my wife's and my phones (Samsung droids), her iPad,my Kindle fire, and my digital camera on the plane, on the beach, at the pool, and then back home with no problems!  It is a bit heavy, but has the power to easily justify the weight.  Seems to last forever, or at least long enough to get you to a power outlet recharge.  Nice to not have to worry about battery life on a digital device as you know you can recharge anything that has a USB cord!",5
Excellent high quality .,5
"After reading numerous review I ordered this external battery for my iPhone 4S.  It took several hours to charge it.  And took a lot less time for it to charge my phone from 18% to 100%.  I'm very happy with this purchase and am glad that it is not phone specific.  Judging by my phone use and the specs for this battery, I think I'll have to charge it again next week.  In closing, I'm very happy with the product.",5
"I work for a company that requires me to travel and be outside a lot. I find it hard to be around a charger, so this has been a blessing for me! I use a smartphone, which would die usually halfway through the day. This allows me to go days without plugging into my home charger. I love you can power two devices at once, as well as the 3 second pause on the power button to help avoid accidental power ups! My only con to this, is I wish the carrying pouch for this was a bit bigger in order to hold both the battery pack and the charger at the same time. Other than that, this has far exceeded my expectations!",5
"Loved the concept.  Worked great and charged my ipad and iphone until the 3rd week i went to use it and it died after charging my iphone once. I fully charged it and it was zapped after one single iphone replenishment.  That's NOT how the specs read.  I figured i had just got a lemon.  However, i tried to return/replace but was told it had expired.  VERY disappointing after reading so many great reviews on it.",1
"1 I purchased  my two New Trent products from Amazon.com. They arrived within the correct time as I am a Prime member. They did a great job as did the company that shipped them.2  I just purchased both the NewTrent IMP120D and the NewTrend iDual 5200mAh.3 I would rate both products a 4.5 on a 1 to 5 scale. Both for the same reason. The major improvement is the same for both. I would make them both have a micro USB slot for the Chargers. As Micro USB is now the standard on most devices, it would be much easier to carry the same charger that I use on my phones, Kindles and Tablets. My kids who are 9 and 10 have DS3d's and the last generation Itouch devices. I like the multi plug you included with the IDual 5200. I would include the same plug with the device it works with my kids DS 3D's.The charger on the IMP 120D is only good on that device. I would without question change the charger to a micro USB for that.The micro USB works with all our Kindle Fires and Kindle Touches. The  only device that we cant charge is my son's Dell Streak given to him by his grandmother, She did not know how to use it.  He loves it.  It has its own unique charger plug, I believe that's the reason why it did not do too well as it is a good device otherwise.My wife has a IPhone 4gs and I  understand why you can not include the charger for Apple. Since the USB plugs on both devices work with the apple chargers, I have no problem with your restrictions, they also work with my kids Itouch devices as well.4. My kids have the last generation of the Itouch line. I believe they are Itouch 4's with 16 gb drives.  My wife has two phones, the Apple I4Gs and an LG viper with Sprint. I have the Samsung Galaxy S3 also with Sprint. My kids have Kindle Touches and my wife and I have Kindle Fires. My son has a Dell Streak Tablet. Both kids also have DS3D's.5.  The IMP 120D charged my devices for a full week. I did not know it would last that long.6.  I use the IDual 5200 for my kids devices and keep it with me at all times.",5
"I currently own 3 of these chargers, because once I experienced the freedom from the wall socket these devices provide and true power-user, all-day battery, I never want to go back.Won't leave home without it:This has become a standard item as indispensable to me as my keys or wallet when I leave the house.  I carry one on me at all times, my wife has one she carries, and we keep one in the car, &#34;just in case&#34;. Our iPhone batteries just aren't up to the abuse we dish out and this charger makes it possible to actually keep using our phones all day. At 12,000 mAh, I can actually use this all week to charge my iPhone before I need to recharge the iCarrier. I tried to buy an Energizer version from the airport once on a trip and it didn't get me 15% charged before it died. This will charge my iPhone 5-6 times before running out. It's also great that we can both double up on one device if one of us forgets ours with both a 1A output for iPhones and 2.1A output for iPads.Rescued Memories:I spent a day in London recently on a layover and this battery literally saved the day. I was taking so many pictures and videos (about 2,500), using google maps and gps, that I actually ran my iPhone battery down FOUR times in a single day and my iCarrier just kept me up and running. As I stood with all the other fans in Craven Cottage watching my first live English soccer game, I wouldn't have been able to capture any of the memories without my iCarrier. I even got a video of a thrilling goal to tie the game in the final minutes that wouldn't have been possible without this device.I have carried it to Paris and shared the twinkling lights of the Eiffel tower with my wife over Facetime.  I have stood on the Old Bridge in Heidelberg and showed my Mom where she walked 50 years ago from 5k miles away. I showed my little girls a Tahitian sunset and white Fijian sands from across the Pacific. None of those moments would have been possible without this battery.I can't tell you how many times people have asked what I'm using to keep my battery going on a 15 hour flight, or while sitting in an airport in Africa. I tell them all the same thing - you'll never make a better travel purchase.Bulletproof:The device itself has taken a mountain of abuse, shoving into overhead bins, dropped who-knows how many times, and it keeps on trucking. I have carried it around the world onto four continents and 3 island chains without missing a beat. The on/off button is responsive, the finish of the case has held up great, and despite all the abuse, there are no chips or dings or scratches to speak of. The matte finish used for the casing was well-thought out. I especially like that the device automatically powers off after a brief period if nothing is connected. I've never had the frustration of going to get this battery and finding it ran down to zero all by itself (unlike my iPad!).Standing tall:The customer service for this device is phenomenal as well. I had one battery that developed an issue with the power cord and New Trent responded promptly and helpfully to resolve it, even sending out a new battery replacement after some very simple and quick troubleshooting. No back and forth or waiting for responses, they handled the issue like a champ and got me back in the saddle within days. Compare that to the vacuum I just had to wait almost 2 months to get replaced and it makes you appreciate a company that stands behind their products.",5
I bought this item when I saw it reviewed on Android Police. I needed a new battery pack to replace my old Sprint one from Years back that just didn't have the capacity to fully charge my Samsung S3. So I've purchased this based on AP's recommendation. It's been great. I've charge my phone and my tablet with it at least 3-4 times before I need to charge the pack again. It's also given me piece of mind as I sometimes 'on call' for work and having this in my bag allows me to charge in cases of emergencies. Overall a great buy for my needs.,5
"I bought this for my wife to keep her iphone 5 charged during a vacation, but it's so convenient she ended up taking it with her every where now.  I have used it to charge iphone5, nexus4, balckberry, psp, and DS lite without any problems.",5
"I have recently upgraded from an IMP50 to the more powerful IMP120D.  I spend many weekend camping, as well as being out in the field away from power.  I tend to use a lot of power - especially from the GPS.  From hiking to Geocaching - my iPhone and iPad take a lot of power.  With the IMP120D I can get through an entire weekend with no problem and not having to worry about being super conservative on power.  I recently spent several days scout camping on the river and had no problem taking pictures and tracking my position for several days with plenty of power to spare.I have also made or purchased cables to help charge anything from my kids Nintendo DS units, to USB flashlights.  I like the fact I have a stand way of charging nearly everything.  The power button on this unit is much improved over the IMP50 in that it can not be accidentally turned on and drain the battery.  I took away a star for two reasons, although minor - there is a 1A and a 2A output, but they are not labeled.  The second reason is minor (and maybe a good thing for others) - when the device is fully charged the IMP turns off to save power.  I actually like it to continually power my iDevice so it is always at 100% so I wish I could override this feature.Would I purchase again?  Absolutely and would not hesitate to recommend to others.",4
"Simply put...  Wouldn't you rather be sitting at your gate relaxing while waiting for your flight than Beijing one of those people that are stuck next to an outlet charging their devices?This thing is great. I keep it in my work bag.  Never see low battery again.  While in. A meeting my phone is in the bag charging.  Charge while you're in the air, so when you get off you're ready to go.",4
"Got this 11ah battery pack for a backup power for my iphone and ipad. I does a good job at powering both these devices. The quality of this unit is lacking, and a little hard to operate and use this battery pack.  You never know when its 'on' or 'off'. You never sure when you turns the power 'on' or just a 'push to test'. My overall opinion is that the battery pack is low quality, BUT, gets the job done.  To be honest, you really can't expect more when paying $52 for 11ah battery pack - so i won't complain too much.  This is one of those, 'you pay for what you get', and I assumed so before the purchase.  So I would have given it 2-3 stars, but gave it 4 stars because it is what it is - ok for the price, but low quality.  I just got it so, long term durability remains the big question.",4
"I got this last October (2012) because my previous 5 year old external battery for USB power was getting a little old and I keep getting devices that are increasingly power hungry. I have an ipad2, vzw razr maxx and various other lower power usb rechargeable devices that I travel with frequently.Its most frequent usage is to provide all day power for my Droid Razr Maxx while traveling and using the Droid as a hotspot for hours at a time. I got the razr max because of its double capacity battery. The down side is that the battery is not removable so when it runs down, you need to plug in to keep working. An external battery which can top it off is the answer. However with a double capacity internal battery, I needed an extra large capacity external battery as well.Although my ipad2 does not usually require charging during a day's use, I have used the IMP120D to charge the ipad2 as well when I forgot to charge it after the previous days use.The IMP120D is small enough that I can use a short 6&#34; cable to connect to my phone, rubber band them together and hold both together in my hand to talk if necessary. I have also used it both in this manner in a rental car's cup holder while using the Droid as a GPS (which really sucks power).Having 2 usb outputs is really useful so I can charge my BT headset and phone at the same time. I have also charged my droid and my wife's iphone simultaneously using both USB ports.I have a USB volt/amp meter so I can test how well devices are charging. I have confirmed that my razr charges faster with the IMP120D (&#62; 1Amp measured) than it does with most wall outlet 2amp/10watt USB power supplies.The rounded edges are nice because I can carry it in my pants pocket without jabbing my leg against an edge.When traveling and not in use, the battery holds its charge with no noticeable loss of capacity. It also turns itself off when the device stops drawing power so it does not run down if you forget about it.Highly recommended if you need a higher capacity external battery that wont break the bank.",5
"I got this as a gift for my wife, who didn't even know she needed it. Since we have all the gadgets, having a huge battery (in mAh, not physical size) that is portable has a lot of benefits. She and the kids find a new reason it's essential pretty much every day.",5
"This charger works great.  It is very powerful and charges my android phone and ipad quickly.  It is a bit bulky, but given the power that may be required.  The fact that it has two USB ports allows me to charge two devices at once which is very nice when i am out of the office for extended periods and need to charge both my phone and tablet.  It charges both very quickly and has enough power to handle both.  I would recommend this product highly.",5
"This unit is outstanding. Small, light weight, simple to use and packs a big punch. It has held a full charge for several weeks and was able to charge my iPhone 5 from 20% to full 3 times and my ipad2 from dead to full all on a single charge of the external battery. I will be buying a few of the smaller versions to keep in my lunch box and for the wife's purse as a 'just incase'",5
This Item works as designed and has been working very well since purchased. It is great for traveling and allows me to charge my phone quickly and confidently on the go!,5
"Let's think about this for a minute, why do I buy a portable charger? The simple answer is my battery is dead. Well if you need to make sure that the charger you buy will work when needed then this is the item for you. Why waste money on a cheaper product that may not work when you desperately need it? If you want quality and dependability then go no further.",5
"Just got the IMP1000 last week, surprisingly it worked right out of the box.  I drained my iPhone4s and iPad 2 to less than 5%.  So far, I have done two complete iPhone 4s charges and one full iPad2 charge,  The power level on the IMP1000 only went down one level and is now on Medium.  The total time it took to fully charge the iPhone 4s was about 1 hr and not sure about the iPad since it was charged overnight but it is fully charged at 100%.  I have some trips coming up with some long flights so this will come in very handy.  I am very happy with this purchase so far.  I have purchased and tried other cheaper chargers including solar ones and so far nothing compares to this IMP1000, I wish I made this purchase from the start.update 6/6/12 - it is now 3 months since I purchased the IMP1000 and thought this update might be useful to some. A few night ago I connected iPad2 to IMP 1000 the battery level on ipad was at 50%, the power level on IMP 1000 was at medium (2 blue lights). The IMP1000 was last charged about 2 weeks ago. Next morning, battery on the ipad 2 was only at 53% (only went up 3%???)  Anyway I left the ipad plugged into the IMP1000 for the entire day and it eventually shut off.  Ipad battery only go to 60%.  HMMMM.  Decided to try charging IMP1000 overnight, plugged into ipad next morning and in no time it fully charged.  I guess it is safe to say that the the IMP needs a full charge to be effective, like any other electronic product the battery will lose it's charge over time and dont always trust the blue light level.  Anyway works fine now.Update 11/1/13 (20 months later) My family has been using the IMP1000 daily since March 2012 it has traveled across the continental US, to London, and soon to Japan.  I am not sure how many times we charged it ( i don't think we hit the 500 mark) but it is in constant everyday use (iPhones, iPads) and there have been absolutely no problems at all.  If you think yours is crapping out just give it a full overnight charge.  I originally paid $79.99 in March 2012.  Price check on Amazon today is $39.95, since my kids refuse to let me use it anymore, it's a no brainer,  I just ordered another one.  I am really surprised that it lasted this long, will keep posting updates until it dies.",5
"I read all the ratings for iPad battery chargers from each of the products offered on Amazon for this purpose and the one that consistently got the right balance of features and praise was the New Trent IMP120.  I noted that it was the only product on Amazon that had a large number of reviews which is is currently over 750 and they are all bunched into the 4 and 5 star category with just a small percentage being lower than that. This is not true for similar chargers over 10000mAh which all  had a larger number of bad reviews except for one product that is no longer available.  So I purchased the New Trent IMP120 and used it as if the power had gone out and I was stuck without electricity. This model performed true to its description and gave me the power to survive a blackout. Other units must charge from a USB port and some charge from wall plugs but don't include an A/C adapter however the New Trent powers from a wall plug and includes an A/C adapter. I was so pleased with the first one I bought another and I keep both units plugged in at all times (it cannot overcharge) just in case of an electrical outage should occur. Hopefully I won't have to use them but if I do need them in an emergency  afterwards I plug them back into the wall to keep up a continuous charge until they are needed again.Since my needs are for emergency use I can keep it constantly charging. If I didn't keep up he charge and unplugged them when fully charged I would have to recharge them regularly because no battery holds a full charge forever, thus it is best for me to keep the plugged into the wall. If I did not keep them plugged in to an electrical outlet and instead recharged them periodically, it would shorten the life of the unit because the number of cycles it can take before its useful life is diminished depends on how often it is charged (this is just the nature of lithium ion batteries which have a relationship between the life of the product and the number of cycles.)I scoured the web and read everything about external battery packs for iPads and other USB charged devices and found that when all was considered the New Trent IMP120 is the one to buy. I contacted the company and they had no plans to increase the mAh so this is not going to be outdated any time soon.  The real factor that gave me confidence to buy one was the real world experience shown in the ratings among similar products which show people are much more confident and pleased with this unit than other similar ones.",5
"At first, I was shocked by the size of the portable charger, but it has not proved to be inconvenient yet. It was charged within a few hours and has been able to charge anything I throw at it. I've charged the following devices: Sony PSP, Sony PlayStation Vita, HTV Vivid Smart Phone, HTC One X Smart Phone, Apple iPod Touch 5th Generation, Samsung Galaxy S2, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet. I had an easy time charging both the battery and my other devices thanks to the ability to use one cord to do everything. Something I found very useful was that I didn't have to use an adapter to charge devices that draw more power such as my PlayStation Vita and my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. Other portable chargers that I've used have required an adapter that I usually end up forgetting at home when I leave. I found that I was able to charge my phone about 5 times fully. I didn't believe that it would really be able to do that but sure enough, it did. I love this charger, and take it with me when I stay at a friend's overnight or when I want to make sure my tablet has backup power. Although this is an amazing device, I did have a few problems. I'm not sure if this was supposed to happen, but when the battery was close to dying, it made a high-pitched ringing noise when I turned it on and then turned off. Also, I can't charge my phone through the 'smartphone port' unless I have something else charging in the 'tablet port'. I thought that was strange, but I easily got around that by plugging my phone into the 'tablet port'. I may have just received a defective unit, but it seems to be working fine now. I would still recommend this portable charger. It is a bit on the heavy side though,  so it may not be ideal for small purses/bags. And since this battery has a higher capacity, I wouldn't leave it in the car or anywhere else that it may cause it to become excessively hot.",5
"Thing is a beast.Amazing how quickly it charges my Note 2 and other devices.Comes with a small micro usb cable, not a cable that you change tips with.It is a bit bulky, and the plastic has some play in it but the performance you get is second to none.Love it.",4
Got this in advance of trip to London involving two ten hour flights.  It recharged my Samsung Galaxy 5 times from the first charge - very useful accessory.,5
"I bought this right before I was going on a Cruise, so I could sit in the sun all day and read and use my Ipad till my hearts content.  My IMP880 did not have the power keep a Ipad on much less charge it.  But this one does both.  It can charge my Ipad 3 to roughly 70% from 0% charge, and that Is a lot considering how big the Ipad battery is.  I recently replaced this with the New trent Ultra Powerpack 14000mAh.  But Both this one and IMP880 are still going strong after several years of use.  I literally will not buy any other charging products except from New Trent.  I really wish they would get into the Laptop market, as I would like a charger for My Laptop especially from a company I have trusted with all my Iproducts.",5
"I travel quite a lot for work and frequently find myself at the end of my phone's charge after being out all day without access to a wall plug.  I spent quite a lot of time researching options and watching prices, and also reading reviews.  This was one of the best options in terms of the combination of having plenty of power, good reviews, price, and features.  I like that it has two USB ports, and I like the design and aesthetics of this one better than lots of other models on the market as well.  It's solid feeling and seems to be nicely constructed.  It's simple to use, charges at the same pace as a wall-charger, and holds enough juice for multiple full charges before needing to be plugged back in and re-charged.  The fact that it's 12000mAh means this is not some wimpy power block.  Although it adds a bit of additional bulk and weight to my carry-on bag for flying, I would much rather have it than not have it.",5
I use my android phone a lot and this charger has the highest mah value for the size.I often carry this in wicket pocket just to charge my phone midday. Normally my phone can more it through the day on one charge no problem but for occasions such as waiting in line for 2 hours for a movie I was able to stream an entire movie and still have 100% battery life because of this toy.If I did not have the charger with me the phone would have died under heavy use. The movie was an evening showing and normally I would only have had 1/2 battery life that time of the day.,5
"Bought the product in November of 2012 for $76.95, and compared to today (6/12/13), the price is now $59.95.  Even at $76.95, the portable charger is well worth it.  My mom absolutely loves her gift.  She travels across the country plenty, and this is such a smartphone battery saver!  Highly recommended!",5
"This is the best backup battery i've had! Hands down the best i've owned, i've had mophie's and other off brand recharger cases.  This battery is pretty compact and does not weigh that much.  It charged my Iphone5 7 TIMES from 0% to 100%.  It also charged my iPad 4th gen 150%.  the charger has an on off switch, also has 2 different usb ports with ipad or iphone voltages.  Perfect I'm a new trent customrer for a while!",5
"I can definitely recommend this battery pack! I've had it for about a month now and like it very much. The form factor is great (rounded, so it fits in your bag easily), looks good, and feels quite small for the high capacity. It is very powerful (I did not scientifically measure the mAh, but find that it holds a lot of power), and it also charges quite fast. For example, you can charge your iPhone in no time with this battery pack. The weight is good too considering it holds 12000mAh. I like the on/off button, it is convenient to switch USB devices on or off without unplugging. The charger lights are very small and built into the button - I like this so I don't have distracting flashing lights go off (e.g. at night).",5
This unit was used while on a two month mission trips in the jungles of Papua New Guinea and it never failed.  We charged it with the Instapark 10 Watt Solar Panel Portable Solar Charger.  It worked flawlessly for our needs and is still going strong.,5
Good quality charger that does it job and then some.  Chargers my iphones and ipad several full chargers before having to be recharged itself.  They have a smaller sized product now that wasn't available when I bought this but so far this is working great for our use.,5
"Aesthetics and Ergonomics:The size (fits comfortably in your hand) and shape and contrasting colors are very appealing.  The micro USB input charge port is conveniently located and easy to find due to the light blue contrast color on the edge of the unit.  The same applies to the dual USB ports for charging devices.  Carry pouch is a nice addition to keep the unit clean and dust-free in transit. Only negative is that the case seems to make a clicking noise if you gently squeeze the sides.  Probably needs a little reinforcement inside the case, but does not harm anything, since the case of the unit is basically pretty solidly built.Functionality:Wow!  Works perfectly.  Arrived 2/3 charged as indicated by the perfectly placed blue LED indicator lights on the on/off switch.  Charged my iPhone4s twice and the power reserve on the unit still registered full.  I feel very comfortable being out and about knowing my phone can be recharged again and again.  Charged my iPad3 and iPhone4s simultaneously without a problem.Extras:The pouch is a nice extra, but could be improved my making it large enough to hold the New Trent, 10W 5V/2A Dual Port high-speed USB AC wall charger (NT90C/IMP90C) which came free when I purchased the unit due to a special promotion on Amazon.  Sweet deal!  The USB cord to connect the device to the Ac wall charger fits in the pouch but gives it a bulky look.Highly recommend this to anyone who can put its 12000 mAh to the test.  I plan to.",5
"The skinny:4 complete charges of smartphones (from 10% to 100%);1 initial charge of the iCruiser three (3) weeks ago;iCruiser energy indicator light at medium; andquick and responsive customer service.This product is a 'must have' for heavy or moderate smartphone and tablet users.Three weeks ago, I purchased the iCruiser because I travel a lot for work and frequently work in areas where electrical outlets are difficult to locate.  Upon receiving the item through Amazon, I immediately plugged in the iCruiser to fully charge the battery.  Given the immense amount of capacity, the initial charge took roughly 6-7 hours.  Two weeks later, I used the iCruiser to charge up my iPhone as well as a friend's Blackberry curve while at work; both phones were tethering around 10% prior to charging.  After quickly and fully charging both phones, the iCruiser energy indicator light was still on high.  The following week, I used the iCruiser for the second time to charge my phone and another friend's smartphone.  The iCruiser quickly charged both phones; afterwards, the iCruiser's energy indicator light was at medium.Last week, I emailed customer service about their other products after visiting their website.  They quickly responded within 45 minutes and answered my questions.  As a result of their responsiveness and the quality of the iCruiser, I purchased another model of their external battery.",5
"I bought the iCarrier about a month ago as I have a pretty hectic travel schedule and as anyone who travels knows, smart phone and tablet batteries have a tendency to die out pretty quickly when you're on the go. The iCarrier delivered! It can charge two things at the same time, and amazingly quick!Unlike some other products, it will charge both up quickly....with another couple charges to spare!I no longer have to scout airports and offices looking for a power outlet with this in my backpack.",5
"I travel a lot for work and this is the best purchase I've made in a long time.  This is SO easy to use.  I use it to charge my Droid Charge  and my Kindle Fire.  Honestly, with this, they never lose a charge.  It's amazing.  I tried another brand that a friend had and it was useless.  Almost didn't buy the Trent because I assumed they were all like this.  This one is amazing though.  I bought three as gifts for Christmas and everyone is satisfied with them.  For the one star reviewers, I think you just had a faulty model.  I can't imagine not being satisfied with this product.",5
"I recently bought the IMP120D charger for use on extended trips away from a power source to keep my iPhone and iPad charged.  Performance of the protable charger is impressive.  I have not had to charge a device fully yet, but have topped off my iPad and iPhone several times with no noticeable drop in power levels to my charger.  It came fully charged and I have not had to recharge yet.  It comes with a very nice carrying pouch and fits well in my laptop briefcase so it is always handy when needed.  Good job NewTrent!",5
"Huge capacity, charges iPad phone at same time. Quick recharge time. 500 recharge cycles. High quality, well made. Great instructions. Can't say enough about this power..... worth every penny",5
"I ABSOLUTLY LOVE my external battery charger. I have an Ipad3 and it seems like everything I buy for it doesn't work. This works wonderfully. I would rate it a 5 for that reason alone. But I get the added value ofbeing able to charge 2 devices at the same time. So if there were such a thing as 5+, this product would get it.",5
"I purchased this product last year and it has been a life saver too many times to count!  As a person who travels for meetings alot as well as a big hunter, I need the most life out of my iPad and iPhone.  This device has been the best solution!",5
"This is an excellent charger for any on-the-go person with multiple power-hungry devices, that may not have easy access to chargers/plugins. 12000 mAh means several phone charges, or one full phone and tablet recharge throughout the day. It is a bit bulky to fit in a pants or even jacket pocket, so if that's you, you may want to instead consider something smaller like the IMP52B from New Trent, albeit sacrificing battery capacity. It is fine in a bag/briefcase, and comes with a USB-micro USB cord, and has 2 USB ports compatible with all brands charging cords. I like that it has its own charger and port, as you know it's getting properly charged, however that can add more bulk and cords to remember when travelling. Overall an excellent product. Highly recommend to anyone.",5
"This is a very poor product. It is not good at all. I tried to place it at VIRGIN MEGA store since they are professionals in this issue and the guy told me that this will not last for long because it is very poor. The guy was correct and this is what happened, every week I had to go to place a new one because it gets tiered very easily.",2
These are really good screen protectors they come with 6 front screen protectors and 6 back screen protectors.. They came very fast and they are anti glare and you don't see the finger print marks left behind that much and they don't get oily,5
I like the fact it was shipped fast and came single packaging I took off my tempered glass screen protector to use this for now until I'm ready to put it back on and I like the way it looks and feel as if there is nothing on my phone. I would buy again I only needed the backs.,5
Horrible quality. Direction stickers were marked on the wrong sides. Holes were punched but not detached. Better to spend the money  somewhere else.,1
easy to put on and look good with no bubbles and came with a ton of them so ill never run out,5
"This screen protector is anti-glare and does it's job once applied. also minimizes the fingerprints left behind on your phone. Easy to wipe clean, but takes a steady hand to apply. Having a back protector is a plus. Must have for any phone out of the case.",5
Perfect fit! not too small or too large like some. Fits brilliantly on both iPhone 4 and 4S. I love the look it gives and the smooth non-tacky feel!,5
"i use it every day but its not for anti glare. its more for protection. if needed, in the future would purchase as a protector.",1
sometimes i order screen protectors and they dont even fit! But this time that wasnt the case. These fit perfect on my iPhone 4s and I love that they dont really show finger prints when you touch the screen. great buy!!!,5
"I purchased the screen protectors for my new Iphone, it's always cheaper on Amazon then in stores, however not all protectors are good. However, when I received this one I was happy! I ordered a set pf protectors before this one, but it was not anti-glare so it didn't look good. Then I ordered these and they were perfect. Easy to put on and anti-glare, just what I needed!",5
"These screen protectors are definitley worth more than what I paid. I'd forget to switch them out because they held up so long. Only down side is they get really greasy fast, but given what I paid not a big deal to have to wipe them off. Also received before expected date.",4
I have an iPhone 4s. I was hoping this would have the hole for the front camera and it did.  The screen was very easy to put on and there are no bubbles.  The screen is not glossy which may not appeal to some but the upside is that this protector is not a finger print magnet and you will not have issues with glare.  These are a great value.,5
"So the back protectors are perfect! They've lasted me forever! However, the screen protectors are horrible!!! They apply really bad and don't even last. I suggest you invest in tech armor ones! Cheap yet so amazing!!!",1
"I have had this phone for 2-3 months now.  and there are a lot of things i like about it, the screen is absolutely beautiful, crisp color and bright.  the keypad keys are a little far apart but that is no big deal, its very useful and easy to use.  it is a fast phone and i only need to restart every so often (i have had phones i needed to restart at least once a day or more).  Call quality is good, GPS is a little off but its close enough to not bother me, and the battery life is tons better then i thought.  i can comfortably stream Pandora for 6 hours and still have battery life, not much but enough.my problem with this phone and why i would NOT recommend it to others is Samsung's ability to update their product.  There is a major update currently for this phone and it has been reported that it will not happen for several reasons.  Mostly $$$$, Samsung wanting $$$$ and carriers not willing to pay.All other major carriers of Android devices that have the ability to update have done so.I will avoid Samsung products from here on out.",2
"I have owned a Samsung Epic that I did not purchase on Amazon for 6 months now. The design of the product is great. I love the phone in theory. However there are several problems that one will have to address to make this phone workable.The battery is underpowered. The 1500 mA battery does not last a full day if you truly use this phone's fuctionality. You will HAVE to buy an extended battery and that will make it wider. Also with every extended battery, expect the cover to eventually start to fall off all the time. It is VERY irritating.The Sprint bloatware on your phone, the apps that you cannot uninstall such as Qik video, Sprint Nascar, Sprint TV, Samsung Media hub, Facebook, are on YOUR phone for good. You cannot uninstall these. They will ask you to update them constantly and ask for new permissions to track your life. If you dont update them they will constantly ask for update. This alone is annoying enough to make me want to leave Sprint. These apps that you may not want run in the background, use up system memory and CPU power and drain your battery.Do not expect your Epic to connect to your Windows 7 computer. I have tried and tried, changed cables and installed drivers, it connects maybe once for every 10 attempts. It is rediculous.Expect Sprint 'updates' to your phone to be rammed down your throat. Updates such as Sprint data optimizer which will connect your phone automatically to any Wifi you have remembered in your phone. The update installed itself and started doing this WITHOUT my permission. Welcome to Sprints corporate control over your phone.All in all I believe this phone would have been great if Sprint was not involved in it. They have no business writing software for Samsung's hardware when they don't even keep their website updated to allow smartphones to access it. Sprint's network is great. How they treat the average customer in regards to the customer's hardware sucks very bad (one star).",3
"The Epic is a capable slider phone on the Sprint network. More recent phones have surpassed it in speed, however, so it's of no interest unless you absolutely need the hardware keyboard.I've had an Epic for about a year. I've used a variety competing Android models and Apple's line of iPhones up to the iPhone 4.SOFTWARE:As shipped, the Epic comes with Android 2.3 and Samsung's TouchWiz interface.  Android recently jumped from 2.3 to 4.0, though many new phones not from Google are still shipped with 2.3. Each upgrade brings speed and stability improvements. Samsung's upgrade cycle is much, much longer than HTC and others; the Epic will never be updated to 4.0.TouchWiz is a Samsung 'skin' that adds graphical and usability tweaks to the Android interface. It slows the interface down a bit and makes it look more like an iPhone. You can download an alternate launcher if you don't like it.The major advantage of an Android phone is Google integration. Coming from a Palm Centro, I exported my contacts to my Google account in vCard format. Within a short time, they automatically downloaded to the Epic. Linking my Facebook account had the same effect. Calendar and GMail operate seamlessly, as do the former's reminder notifications. The effect of all this is to minimize downtime in the event of a broken handset. Switching activations with Sprint and syncing a new Epic took me all of five minutes.In contrast to the iPhone, the Epic (and any Android phone) is also capable of using a variety of software keyboards. It ships with Swype. Swype lets you trace out the letters of a word instead of tapping them. In use, it's faster than the Epic's hardware keyboard. You can download other keyboards that dynamically change the size of letters, or that provide a pop-up list of words as you type.Most of the time, you won't bother with the hardware keyboard. It's most useful when you're not typing dictionary words (e.g., passwords), when you want maximum screen area (answering emails, remote desktop, games with key input), and when you want to type something precisely that wouldn't conform to normal grammatical rules (terminal consoles).BUILD:Durability is encouraging. The front facade is all Gorilla Glass, which still looks new after a year. There's almost no friction. The rear has a soft-touch plastic cover that's impossible to scratch with a fingernail. The ground, yes. Fingernails, no. Beneath the cover is a 16 GB microSD card that augments 512 MB of user-accessible storage. Heavy video users may still miss the 8GB or 16GB of on-board memory that comes with other phones. 1280x720 video takes about 90 MB per minute.The keyboard slide mechanism has a strong spring action. The keyboard itself is excellent. The keys have adequate spacing between themselves and the base of the screen and a firm clicking action. The only misstep is the dedicated button for emoticons that should have been an '@' key. Coming from a Centro, I found it a bit large for thumbs. Blackberry users will feel the same; it's too big to lend itself to no-look input. The conventional layout is helpful for typing emails, though, and the direction pad is well-suited to console emulators.Of the three Epics I've used, one had a problem with the vibrate function. Something on the inside would rattle in a cheap and nasty way. There's also some variance in just how tight the gaps are between the screen and the slider base. One phone had essentially no gap, a second was large enough to be disconcerting, and a third was in the middle. With any phone, but doubly so with sliders, check to verify everything works right while you're still within the 30-day exchange window. If you decide it's unacceptable after that point, you'll receive a refurbished replacement instead of a new one.I've dropped my phone 5 or 6 times. The back pops off, the battery falls out, and the phone skitters along the ground. Damage is almost nonexistent. Other phones (e.g., the iPhone) will happily crack their screens from the same drop.SPEED:The Epic has a moderately fast CPU and a fast GPU. The Evo and the iPhone 4 have slower GPUs. Recent phones with dual-core CPUs will put it to shame, but as a practical matter, the Epic is fast enough. All games I've tried work fine. Trapster is the only app it won't dispatch with aplomb.Which is not to say the stock interface is as smooth as that on an iPhone. Android isn't quite as optimized, particularly when papered over with a manufacturer skin. Everything is a bit less immediate. Scrolling will hitch ever so slightly in the interface, and more with graphics-heavy webpages. That exceptional responsiveness characteristic of the iPhone 4 and the 3GS prior to iOS updates, Google and Samsung haven't quite mastered.SCREEN:A superlative, perhaps the Epic's best feature. It's an 800x480 pixel PenTile AMOLED. Let's break that down in comparison to the iPhone 4 and the Evo.800x480 - The iPhone is a 960x640. A handful of recent Android phones are 1280x720. The extra resolution is apparent with web pages zoomed out and console programs. Both are readable, but one will look smoother. The advantage disappears elsewhere. Search 'engadget iphone amoled' for a comparison with screenshots.AMOLED - LCDs use colored elements in front of a uniform, screen-sized backlight. AMOLED screens skip the backlight and use individual colored LEDs.PenTile - Because blue and red LEDs wear out faster than the green ones, the Epic's screen uses an RGBG subpixel arrangement instead of a standard RGB array. Samsung counts two subpixels for each pixel; everyone else counts three. That's a lot of gibberish to say that small details on the Epic's screen are slightly rougher than on the Evo screen, despite their identical resolutions.The use of AMOLED has a few implications. First, the good: the contrast ratio is spectacular. Black is a pure, deep black. Viewed head-on, you can't distinguish the screen from the black bezel. The black on an LCD is, by comparison, a dark slate. Color gamut is extremely high. Colors appear much stronger. They aren't necessarily accurate, but they do make every non-AMOLED phone look dull.Now, the bad: while AMOLED is supposedly capable of 24-bit color (smooth gradients), my Epic shows banding in gradients. It looks like 16-bit color. There is no dithering. The iPhone and others do better with color transitions.Unlike an LCD, power use is directly proportional to the brightness of the screen. Black images use very little power because the LEDs turn off. White screens use a lot: three times that of the iPhone in absolute wattage terms because thousands of LEDs are less efficient than a single backlight. If you're browsing a lot of light-colored websites, the battery will run down much more quickly than if you were just scrolling through a dark interface. This is not a problem that can be solved with software optimization. Full white for this screen pulls 1.1W. With a 3.7V 1500 mAh battery, that equates to just under 5 hours of use, allotting no power to the rest of the phone. The only way to bump the numbers is to lower the screen brightness. In practice, many apps have inverted color schemes that negate this difference.Maximum screen brightness is average. LCDs will be brighter, though it hardly matters because outdoor visibility is determined by minimizing reflections, not emitted light, and the Epic is plenty bright indoors. Outdoors, all three phones are bad, but usable.BATTERY LIFE:It isn't stellar. If you're in Airplane mode with the screen off, it'll last days. With network connectivity enabled and data sync with a Google account, it'll sit for maybe fifteen hours with no use at all, depending on how strong the cell signal is in your area. With heavy use, you'll see four hours. With graphical games, even less. 4G is rumored to take a heavy toll on the battery if you're moving.But there's a lot of room for improvement, particularly in standby time. Everything I'm about to say will void your warranty if Sprint gets wind of it. I've left my own Epic stock for that reason, but if you're willing to get your hands dirty, you can have something much better.ROOTING:All Android phones ship with a limited set of functions available to the user. Bypassing the restrictions on how you can interact with OS is called rooting. With `root' access, you can change everything, up to and including all of the Android system files. The Epic is, after all, just a handheld computer. Were there a version of Windows for ARM processors, you could conceivably install that on it.It's useful to think of Android as a collection of components. The Android version (e.g., 2.3) is a package released by Google with applications, system files, and a kernel that all match and work together. This package is distributed in a single file called a ROM. Because Google publishes the Android source code, the Android community can build their own ROM packages with customizations.The extent of the customization dictates what the modification will be called. If it simply replaces system graphics to give a new look, it's a theme. If it replaces the installed application set and the core system files, which may or may not include a modified kernel, then it's a ROM.For our purposes, the kernel is a useful focus because, on many Android phones, it governs the clock speed of the CPU. The remaining components of the ROM dictate the appearance and functionality of the Android OS version.To change these two pieces on a new Epic, the process is like so:* Restart the phone in Download mode.* Using ODIN, a simple flashing utility that runs on a Windows computer connected to the Epic with a USB cable, flash a pre-rooted Android 2.2 system image.* Drop a new ROM, which is a single large ZIP file, with your preferred alterations on the Epic's SD card.* Reboot the phone and enter ClockWorkMod, a new boot loader part of the pre-rooted image, and `Install' the ZIP file.The new ROM may have: new wallpapers, sounds, transparency effects, customized program launchers, transparent tethering, different applications, battery optimizations, and so on. Custom kernels may allow the CPU to be overclocked and underclocked more easily. These changes increase the battery life to in excess of 15 hours with moderate use. The user interface reaches iPhone 4 levels of responsiveness.I've intentionally left out explanatory detail in the steps above. You can find it all on XDA Developers and Android Central, as well as alternative methods for phones with data to be preserved. The entire process takes about ten minutes and absolutely transforms the Epic. Consider: the popular Android distribution called CM9 brings Android 4.0 to the Epic. It runs far better than any previous version, including those offered by Samsung.USEFUL APPLICATIONS:While not strictly about this phone, there are a few applications I've found unusually useful or well-executed:Juice Defender - Automatically disables radios not in use. Also sets a global refresh interval for all programs that use background data. Major improvements in idle battery life.Screen Filter - This tamps down the minimum screen brightness to improve your eyes and your battery life. It can be enabled as a one-touch widget.Wifi File Explorer - This lets you browse and change the phone contents over a wifi connection with a browser. See also: SwiFTP (better for bulk changes), Websharing (similar).Remote Web Desktop - Wifi browser-based desktop environment that lets you do most major phone functions on your computer. See also: LazyDroid.PrinterShare - Print to any printer over wifi.Opera Mobile - An excellent mobile browser for Android. UI responsiveness is best-in-class. Also features Opera's in-house page compression enabled.Torque - Coupled with a $20 OBD-II reader, it gives real-time stats of every output from an ECU.Andie-Graph - A free TI-82/83/85/86 emulator. Identical to the originals, though you'll have to Google the ROM images for each one you want to use.EPIC vs. EVO 4G vs. SHIFT:If you've settled on Sprint, you need to find a Sprint store to try these phones out. They have different strengths, and what you think you want, you may not. Note: this is a legacy comparison. As of early 2012, the Epic 4G Touch is probably the best Sprint phone.The Evo is thin, blocky, and has an enormous screen. The pocket lump doesn't protrude like an Epic, though you'll definitely see the squarish form factor in skinny jeans. Build quality is high; it feels like a solid object. It's roughly as fast as an Epic. Battery life is equally bad. Screen contrast and color isn't as nice, but text is a bit smoother. The Evo is also capable of HDMI-out, and HTC releases Android updates faster than Samsung.The Shift I tried was simply bad. The Epic screen has the ideal size; the Shift is too small. It's also molasses slow. The Sprint store demo phone was truly awful, taking literally twice as long as or more than the Epic at everything. Even simple things, like grabbing a GPS signal. Screen contrast is worse than the Evo, and color, slightly so. It looks washed out compared to the Epic. The keyboard has totally decent key response, but the top row is wedged too close to the screen bottom. The rest of the build appears cheap and chintzy. The Shift's lone advantages appear to be HTC's update cycle, a slightly more pocketable size, and better battery life.Put another way, Sprint's choices are much the same as they were six months ago: Evo or Epic. For my money, the Epic is the best of the lot, and when rooted, it's competitive with or superior to anything available today. Stock to stock, though, a patient buyer would benefit from holding out for three months until the dual-core phones arrive on Sprint.",4
"Can someone tell me why my current phone, a Nexus s 4G, which has the same specs as my last phone, epic 4g, yet benchmarks much higher even if rooted and all of sammy's apps are taken out? It just doesn't make sense that the same hardware running the same os could have such different results. Also the battery life is horrendous. I got 6 hours of standby tops without putting it in airplane mode.",2
"My eye sight is not that great, so a big but well contrast screen is important in my phone seletion. I dumped.the iphone for The EVO for its huge screen, a month later when the Epic showed up, I am so impressed with the AMOLED screen, I switched on the same day it was available, well actually the night before...The biggest selling point is, of course its screen. The color is crisp and clear, like constantly holding an HD TV in you hand, you can adjust the brightness to the lowest, yet the contrast is still there to make anything on it lively.The second impressive feature is the keyboard. For people who text a lot, you're in heaven. The keys are spaced so it is not easy to type two keys at the same time, good for clumsy fat fingers like mine.Number 3 reason? The speed. The cpu really flies while browsing or running apps.Belos are some complaints my friend and I have:Android 2.1 still have the battery life problem, but 2.2 should come soon, I hope, to fix it.WiFi seems not too stable so I get disconnected sometimes, but the 3G(no 4G yet in my area) is fast enough so it is hardly noticeable.Phone cannot be operated while charging using the AC adapter, meaning no fun while battery is low, because USB charging is slow.Finally, voice dialing not working with my bluetooth headset, while EVO works perfectly, not good if I need to call someone while driving, and Samsung never seems to be able to do thus right base on my experience with their phones.9/17/10 -I used to give it 5 stars, but am downgrading it to 3 star: too nany little problems. Samsung tends to rush product out so it can be no. 1 of something. The release it first, fix it or maybe not later attitude really spoiled a nice device like the Epic. The biggest stupid problem I have is the voice search/dialing. If the bluetooth headset is on, it will not work, now that is something I can't figure out for the life of me. Even the cheapest Sony phone can do voice whatever easily. If not for the screen and keyboard, I will switch back to EVO, at least EVO has no problem with it.On a side note, if you prefer touch screen keyboard and slimmer phone, EVO is still the NO. 1 choice. Now, if HTC is going for LED...9/21/10- Just updated to the new DI07 kernel; don't know if something else I did or what, battery life improves tremendously, I had it on and check emails from time to time, make calls at least 1.5 hours a day, from a 97% full charge (the blue led is not that accurate) 4 AM in the morning to 10 PM, I still have 70% battery juice left, quite impressive that deserves 1 star upgrade. If they fix the voice dialing problem, I will definitely give it back the 5 stars!!!",4
"I couldn't be more disappointed with this phone. I can't make it thru the day at a baseball tournamment or at work without a recharge. Had to order the double size battery from SEIDIO here on Amazon. Cases are horrible on this phone too. Otterbox is to slippery and the grips to the slider are weak plastic. Seidios cases are even worse, the thinner clips break so fast. Seidio's belt clip also broke, so I'm stuck carrying this bad boy around. I actually got this phone for the keyboard, but once I got it and learned to use swype, I never ever use it. The slide out keyboard is pretty good, one of the best around, and gives the phone some decent weight but honestly you won't use it, swype is amazing.Yes, I've cleaned out all my apps and management my downloads, but battery life on this phone is horrible. The phone has major issues. Screen gets stuck, dropped calls or can't send texts, in covered areas. I have to constantly reboot the phone and/or take out the battery to reset it or unlock the screen. Have had to have Spring reset it twice. Very very disappointed. I loved my blackberry curve in my otterbox. That thing was awesome, but no apps, and sloooooow internet killed the usefulnes of that one. I still use it for my daily alarm.Not a huge fan of Android OS either. On this phone, difficult to make a call, lots of steps required. Favorites aren't as easy at the blackberry numbers.  All I had to do was punch 22 + Call and I could call my wife, 14 was a buddy, etc. That system is so much easier and quicker than all the menu selections.  I don't like the integration with Facebook either. I don't need to call those people but they get in the way when you try to type in names, etc. Nice to have pictures from FB but annoying to scroll when trying to make a call.When this contract is up, I'll be switching to the iPhone. I'm going to wait on the 5.I've heard great things and promises about the Samsung Galaxy S3 coming out this summer, but now that Sprint has done away with their Premier Program I'm stuck with a phone for 2 years, instead of 12 months. So I'm not going to gamble on that phone. My wife and step son both have iPhones with minimal to zero issues (one is on AT&T; and the other on Sprint) so seems the iPhone is the phone to get.Sorry Samsung, I tried. But this phone was a huge let down.",1
"I have been playing around with both phones and because I belong to Sprint for the rest of my life's tenure, I shall let you know that these are the two best phones available in the market but let's compare which is better at what.Appearance -  The Evo 4G does not have a slide-out QWERTY keypad like the Epic. The Epic despite the keyboard is about an ounce lighter in weight and that says a lot about the AMOLED screen and the absolutely flawless design on this phone. The charging port is located on the TOP of the phone and also has a little slide you need to drag open before accessing the MICRO USB/Charger. The phone looks a terrific black (like the best looking iPhone, oh yeah we care, no sarcasm) when the screen is not on. UNLIKE THE EVO, the standby key is on the right hand side of the phone and does the same thing. On first appearance, the design of the Epic is mouth watering. I've always found Sidekick like phones cheesy and even that DROID from VERIZON looks very plastic to me but I shall diss no more, the Epic might just win on this account (but I know plenty of Evo users who would disagree but this is my opinion). Because of size, weight, 4-inch screen (Evo's 4.3), design of the slide out, the Epic wins this round.Call Reception / Loud Speaker -> While playing music, I noticed the Epic was a little louder than the Evo is but at full volume, it can be a tad too loud too which is obviously such a WELCOME FEATURE. The Evo has a loud speaker alright and also a dedicated home page where you can easily play your music but what matters is the sound because both phones offer excellent customization.Battery Life - This is one of the primary reasons the Epic is likely to do good. I fume when I hear people say the DROID X has a better battery life than the Evo. On Epic, the AMOLED screen ensures you don't need to charge this phone more than once a day. I managed to make this last for atleast a day but I did find the battery readings to be inaccurate from time to time. Maybe this happened because I was trying the phone on Airplane mode and then switching to CDMA so that could be it. There was a difference in the battery life, sometimes the bar would be short and sometimes substantially longer. Maybe it is just a software update that is required but at the end of the day, You can have all the features on a phone but what matters a lot is battery life and the Epic takes this round too. By getting the Evo you will need to buy an extra battery unless you like carrying your wires everywhere you go. If you're getting the Evo make sure you get an extra battery charger and oh save yourself some money and NEVER INVEST ON EXTENDED BATTERIES. You wouuld think Samsung and HTC are more clever than not to have come out with the extended battery in the first place. Feel free to discuss, throw things at me on the comments column.Screen Brightness - HTC Evo is about AS BRIGHT AS THE SUN, absolutely incredible brightness, it's like watching the most expensive HDTV sometimes. The phone even on low brightness is surprisingly bright and I always appreciate brightness. While the Epic is not dull, I'll be lying if I say the screen is as bright as the Evo or even comes close to taking this round. The Epic has a jaw dropping display but the brightness and screen quality while you're on a webpage makes Evo the winner here. The brightness may come at the price of battery life but when you drive a HUMMER, you worry not about the battery life but about the drive.Build Quality of Plastic on the BACK - The Evo certain feels a little more solid and smooth. The back on the EVO is better than the INCREDIBLE. Evo's kickstand is an added feature but the quality of the plastic on the Evo is 15% better than the Epic when you're holding the back though Epic is quite good as it is. **Caution** Do not remove Epic's back size by the SPEAKER, you may damage the phone cause you're such a strong individual, locate a small opening at the end and then LIFT UP the back plastic covering the battery. The back is obviously not RED like the HTC EVO.Bundled Accessories - Epic comes with a 16gb card, in ear earphones, a thicker BASIC manual I haven't opened and read yet. The Evo comes with an 8gb card and no earphones. They both come with a Micro USb Cord which coverts into a wall charger. I have tried and used almost all earphones bundled with phones and have never seen any Sprint phone with such good quality 'in-ear' earphones which provide NOISE CANCELLATION. An excellent extra for the fifty bucks you pay depending on where you're buying the phones from. 16gb is like having 2 x 8gb cards.Mobile Hotspot - DRAWTask Killer App - If you hold the home button down on the Epic, an excellent task killer pops up. It is so easy and fun to use that this alone was a big big big deal for me. I've used it on the Evo before but it's just so much hassle free and cleaner on the Samsung, it tells you the percentage of the CPU being used for variety of apps in REAL TIME! Deal-MAKER for me. EVO owners, please correct me if I'm wrong.CAMERA *BIG DEAL FOR ME* - Epic. Epic. Epic. Epic. The customization is Godly. Samsung is slowly becoming very clever. The camera quality is that of a digital camera, I dare say. Also if people are moving and pause for a second, the phone still takes an absolutely astounding photograph. The Evo makes things yellow and although it's 8megapixel, the camera doesn't quite seal the deal. The other thing is that the Evo doesn't have that many customizations for the camera. Samsung has pulled a magic trick with this one. Some envious Evo users tell me that because the screen looks better on the Epic, the images look better but if I were to upload these to my computer, there'd be a difference. This is my response to people who say something like that. How often will I be uploading these pictures? Maybe once in four days, I will be mostly viewing them on the phone so I don't care about that. Mind you, though I haven't uploaded anything yet, I shall upload them and send you a sample picture if you request one. PLEASE BARE IN MIND, while the SAMSUNG has more options, it will take a real techoholic to want to figure out each and every feature, I'm still getting WARMED up to it.Google Sync - The google sync on both phones immediately got all my contacts into the phone, there are a ton of applications so if you have a gmail account even with a blackberry, all your contacts are gonna be SYNCED with either the EVO or the EPIC. Google has a very funny deal-sealing way of having the google sync on the BLACKBERRY. If you're dumping your blackberry, make sure you do google sync and sync all your contacts before activating the EPIC. Ask a store rep to do it for you before buying it BLINDLY from them.BROWSING - Browsing on the Evo is the best browsing I have ever seen. It still wins over the Epic by just a single point. Epic still gets a 9/10 while Evo because of it's multi-touch gets a perfect 10. There is no lag while browsing or using the touchscreen at all. This is a dream come true for people who've ever had the Samsung Instinct from two years ago. These two phones make my Blackberry look so bad and that's one thing to love and admire about Androids, the fact that they have such capable awesomse fast, intelligent browsers. I have no complaints whatsoever. I have an iPod touch and its half as good at best and I'll tell you the iPod touch is amazing. EVO wins by a life because it's the best at it. Epic is still about two and a half times as good as my Sprint BOLD.On-Screen Typing : On screen typing on the Evo is way better because of HTC's on screen Qwerty. Swype comes built in with the EPIC. I've never used it, I don't believe in it, just looks too cheesy. Evo has a great typing mechanism but EPIC assumes that unless you're typing casually, you will use the physical keyboard to type. The Evo's typing is better than the iPhone's or the iPods. I haven't played with the iPhone 4 yet.SLIDE OUT / PHYSICAL KEYBOARD : I will go for the Epic over the Evo because it has a wonderful, non-cheesy, idiot proof keyboard slide out. This is the best addition possible besides the camera and the bundled accessries. I despise the Moment's keyboard in comparison though Moment isn't a bad phone. The EVO is supposed to be Sprint and Samsung's replacement for the SAMSUNG MOMENT.I've been away from my 2 day old Epic. I will discover more things and shall let you know. Any cons? The capacitive keys on the front could've been a touch more responsive. On the Evo they seem more responsive. I'm in no hurry for the Samsung Epic to get 2.2 and I'm sure they won't disappoint.Wallpapers look brighter, more alive, sleeker, sexier, more sophisticated on the Epic. When you're in your menu on the Evo you go from top to bottom while on the Epic, if you click Applications you go left right right right. So it's horizontal menu browsing on the Epic and vertical on the Evo.There is so much more for me to discover. I told someone earlier this year that no phone will ever match the iPhone but technology has an astounding way of shocking me. I'm an absolute geek and am glad that the Epic exists. It's like action sequences on the Lord of the Rings : Twin Towers while Evo is like the Matrix chase scenes from Reloaded. Both are feature packed phones but I love to type and the additional keyboard is fantastic for typing.Wi-Fi Browsing : If both phones were used on the Wifi, the Epic is blazingly fast and obviously an easy hands down winner. I didn't try browsing on both using the 3G signal in Manhattan though it loaded a youtube video and downloaded an mp3 rather fast.MISCELLANEOUS THINGS: Epic comes with a game, it also a Samsung HUB, it doesn't have an HDMI port but has something called DLNA which enables you to wireless connect the phone with compatible televisions and monitors. The AMOLED screen is Samsung's proprietary format I read somewhere, Samsung will invest $2 Billion in the next year or two for making screen for all touchscreens.I'm sorry about how random this review might seem but I really wanna go back to playing with the Epic so see you later. My conclusion is obvious from the subject.**UPDATES**Samsung Epic has four buttons when you slide out the keyboard. One is for the Home, one is the back key, one is the menu, one is the features Key. These behave just like the FOUR buttons on the front beneath the screen when viewed vertically.I'm falling in love with the wallpaper options. The HTC Evo has something called scenes and the profile customization is exciting, I wonder how ANDROID 2.2 will look on the EPIC.Please buy an invisible shield when you buy this phone, I'm looking for an Anti-Glare one for $10. Any suggestions?I saw a lady with the Samsung Epic today, she had a cheesy black plastic case on her EPIC. POOR CASES can make the Epic look like the Samsung MOMENT (Sorry, Moment owners, no offense, just honesty).  I am not going to use any case for this phone, what a waste of a gorgeous phone.I also thought I should add a note that I have never bothered investing in a SAMSUNG phone for myself but the EPIC really made it an easy decision. The Galaxy S series is remarkable. I live in New York and get no 4G but I do get unlimited data downloads, video calling and that's all. I don't mind the $10 extra fee but it may hurt the price conscious user but SPRINT is still a better deal than the other carriers so don't OVER THINK it.**11/01/2010 Update**4G has been launched in NEW YORK and I can download a 3mb song from gmail in 13 seconds.Shazam takes a second to tell you the name of the song that's playing.Does consume a lot of battery though.UPDATE 05/06/2011  - To people who are thinking about getting the Epic, there is soon going to be a new 4G phone so please RE-CONSIDER because there is the NEXUS S out. It doesn't have a keyboard mind you and yes it is based on Sprint's WIMAX 4G.",5
"Some background:I switched from iPhone 3GS (AT&T;) to Epic 4G (Sprint). Prior to the iPhone I had an AT&T; Tilt and Samsung Blackjack (AT&T;).I was reluctant to order this phone. I was quite happy with the iPhone but I was tired of the locked-down approach that Apple has.  So this was my 'first' Android phone and I definitely had very high expectations from it.Both Epic 4G and Sprint disappointed me to the extent that I am going back to AT&T; with an Atrix 4G.Pros:1. Crisp high resolution screen. It is comparable to iPhone 4.2. Great integration with Samsung TV/Blu-ray (if you have them).3. Haptic feedback on the screen is great. Makes it feel more interactive.4. Overall voice quality is good - except for the speakerphone (see below).5. I recorded some 720p videos and I was impressed with the result. The cameras on this phone are great.Cons:1. I cannot stress this enough: Battery! Battery! BATTERY! It lasts for less than 4 hours under normal use. By 'normal' I don't mean playing YouTube videos constantly. I mean just browsing the web, using Facebook, and setting email to check for every 15 minutes. Under heavy use (e.g. live video stream), the battery wouldn't last for more than an hour. You have to keep charging it whenever you can or you'll have nothing but a brick in your pocket once the battery is dead unless you have a spare one fully charged and ready.2. Battery recharges is very slow!!! I mean extremely slow!! You have to keep it plugged in all night to get it to fully charge. And no, I am not plugging it to a computer's USB port. I am using Samsung supplied wall adapter.3. 4g signal is spotty even if you live in the downtown area where Sprint advertises full 4g coverage. The 4g signal keeps going to sleep (showing Zzz). When it does go to sleep, it will NOT wake up even if you try to use the Internet. You have to actually disable and then enable 4G to wake it up. And then it will go back to sleep within minutes even while you're using data. Completely useless. Not sure if this is a device issue or something with Sprint 4G services. But it is not good.4. Speakerphone on this phone does not perform well in slightly noisy environments. It has to be completely dead silence for you to be able to use speaker phone or you'll be constantly repeating to the person on the other line. When the speaker phone is turned off, the call quality is good.",2
"I've been a Blackberry user (Curve and more recently, Tour) for a long time. Prior to that, a Palm user. With all the great new touch screen phones coming out, I was itching to switch. But I wasn't about to switch to AT&T; just to get the iPhone. I have also been with Sprint for years, and in my opinion, they have THE BEST coverage/service and plans (I never have dropped calls and they have the best 'Everything' plan). Also, I wasn't willing to get a phone that only had a touch screen for entering text. True, AT&T; has the new Blackberry Torch, but again, I would've had to switch to AT&T.;So I was so happy when Sprint came out with the new Samsung Epic (I'm glad I waited for this instead of getting the Evo). Simply put, this phone is AMAZING! It has everything I was looking for, among other things, the touch screen and pull-out keyboard. And while this phone is much larger than my previous Tour and really bigger than my husband's Palm Pre, it isn't any heavier. The build of the phone is solid. When you pull out the keyboard, you can do so with the confidence that it won't wobble or break.  The Amoled screen is unsurpassed and the live wallpapers are beautiful! The colors are so vivid and true, and with the size of the screen, watching videos is wonderful! The speed of the browser is super fast too (this is one reason I wanted to switch from my Blackberry, which I also loved). The browser on the Blackberry is so slow and the browsing experience is lacking since the screen is so small. The pull-out key board is great, but I actually find myself not using it that much because I have gotten used to entering text using the Swype function. It is so fast and intuitive. Once you get the hang of using it, I don't think you'll be entering text with the keyboard.There are still some things that are lacking, however, which caused me to give this a 4-star, instead of, a 5-star rating. First, the ability to sync with Microsoft Exchange is lacking. Currently, there is no way to sync your notes and tasks from Outlook. I use these a lot so I had to find work-arounds for this (I use Evernote for my notes and Remember the Milk for my tasks). Second, there is no spell check. I'm not sure why as this seems to be something that shouldn't be hard to include since gmail has it. Third, there doesn't appear to be a way to select the default calendar when entering new appointments (you have to always select which calendar you want the appointment in). Also, there doesn't appear to be away to dismiss select appointments. Again, I have had to use a work-around (I use the free Calendar Snooze). Fourth, the ability to customize the ringer and notification profiles is somewhat limited (you have to download an app (I use Quick Profiles) to do this - not a big deal, but it would be good if this was already included). Truly, these are not actual functions of the phone itself, but of the Android OS. So I'm hoping that with the eventual upgrade in OS, these issues will be addressed and resolved.While I have had to alter the way I do things on my device, this has not been a dealbreaker for me. I am extremely happy that I purchased this phone (through Sprint) and that I am using the Android OS. I am a Android convert for good. I'm learning new things on this phone everyday and I'm looking forward to the upgrade in the OS - hopefully soon!",4
"Just wanted to share where my point of view comes from before I start:- This is my first Android phone- I used a Palm Pre for the past year and a half (love it, really hard to give up)- I used an EVO for about 3-6 hours, side by side with the Epic. Plus:- I read about 50 different professional reviews online about both the Epic and the EVO to decide which one to buyQuick Review (if you want all the details read more below)Cons:- Battery Life- Too many hidden Apps open by themselves all the time (Android inherent and not just this phone)- VGA front camera (lower resolution than phone screen...)- No SMS/IM integrated area/application (you have to open 2 different apps at least)- Back camera lens comes all the way out, so I am constantly putting my fingers all over it.- Youtube videos come out in low quality, small rectangle (lots of wasted space, the EVO uses HQ videos that expand the entire screen)Pros:- Super Amoled screen. It is truly gorgeous.- Android Market Place (90,000+ applications and counting)- Fast (I use the phone for web browsing quite a bit, this one loads pages faster than even the EVO)- Design: plastic matte back keeps it finger print free, front glass piece, flushed black design looks really good.- Main camera quality. Wow. For pictures with good light, you can truly leave your point and shoot camera at home. Picture quality is really, really good.- Graphic processor can be 40% faster than EVO. I won't be playing games much on it at all, but I figured some people will be interested in that.- Includes decent headset and a 16GB micro sd card.What I didn't care for:- Physical keyboard (I chose this phone despite it. The keyboard is fine, I just find myself using the touchscreen keyboard 95% of the time) I would have loved to have a skinnier phone, or a beefier battery over the physical keyboard. However, I must confess that when I am going to type a long email, I slide out the physical one, I can type a lot faster on it, and it's overall more comfortable.- Android buttons are backlit (Home, Menu, Back and Search) so they will be using up battery all the time they are on. By default they hide after a few seconds. For someone unfamiliar with Android it was really annoying to have to guess which button to press (you cannot see them at all) to get to the option you were looking for. You need to go to the settings and make this last as long as the screen is on - at least at first. The nice part about it, is the phone looks clean and totally black when watching a video, playing a game, reading a book, etc.Why I chose over EVO:- Faster web page loads (tried both side to side with the same wifi connection and read reviews online)- ScreenWhat the EVO has that I like better:- HTC has proven that it will update to new versions of Android in a timely fashion. Samsung on the other hand...- HD youtube that uses all the screen real estate- Build quality - feels heavier and more durable (it's a close call, but it feels more expensive than the Epic)In-depth review:My main complaints with a small review of each portion.1. Battery lifeBy comparison my Palm Pre lasted me more, about 24 hours with normal use - granted about 18-22 of those hours where standby - however with data sync enabled, so chat, emails were synching every hour or so, and google chat was constantly on.What I did to get better battery performance:* download Advanced Task Manager (allows you to see all the open apps draining your battery, you'll be surprised how many apps android likes to open - more on that later. Use this program to constantly kill the 10+ programs that creep up on the background) NOTE UPDATED: After using the phone more, I while I believe this helps, it doesn't help very much, you might gain a few minutes a day, the big saver for me is the next one:* download Juice Defender (the free version) (allows your phone to turn off features when the screen is off. Like 3g, you can customize to connect and synch at specific intervals, like once every 2 hours or so) when the screen is off - simple but genius.* Screen brightness all the way down (it is still plenty bright, I left it just 1 level above, to enjoy that screen more) I also want to point out that* No live backgrounds or widgets that constantly connect online on your home screen (facebook, etc)* if you have a weak 4g signal, turn it off (downtown I can use 4g, but the radius of the antenna coverage is about a mile at most). Note - what drains the battery is not 4G itself, is the phone connecting/disconnecting constantly between 3G and 4G to retrieve data. IF you have strong 4g coverage you'll be fine.Optional things to increase it further:* Turn off background sync (this has a decent impact, but even accessing the marketplace somehow requires background data to be active, so a lot of application won't work. If you don't charge your phone overnight, turn this off then.Having these things on will let the device last you the entire day with normal-light use. You can choose to only turn these apps when you need them. I know most people charge their phones over night, but I am usually out and about in the later afternoon/night so I have gotten used to charge the phone at work, since I am always at my desk. My goal is for the phone to last me from 5pm to about 1pm the next day (when I'll start to charge it)Basically without the changes above, the phone drains about 5% of it's battery per hour when in 'idle'. With all those changes it goes down to about 1% or less. The phone is truly in idle then. (Updated10/03/10: simple having Juice Defender and setting it to disable data access when the phone is idle does the trick)Much has been said about how the Super Amoled screen save battery because the black pixels are off. This is one of the reasons the black levels are so deep - there is no light (unlike the EVO screen for example).However, this is not presently the case. I am not sure of the reasons - it's possible that the actual lit pixels (any other color) use so much power as to offset the gains from the black pixels. Either way, after using the screen for maybe 30 minutes (for a game) my battery indicator (checks all the power on the phone and how it's being used)Claims that the 30 minutes I used it, used about 15% of the battery life.To give you a clear picture - I just started testing to see how long it would last with all the optimizations and light use (which I do several times a week)- The screen has been on for probably 30 minutes, maybe 45 minutes.- I had a 25 minute phone call, and made a couple of short calls (less than 2 minutes)- I have sent and received a total of about 10 texts- Browsed the web for about 30 minutes (using 3g)- Browsed the web for 10-15 minutes (using 4G)- Watched about 5 minutes of Sprint TV (over 4G)- Streamed Pandora for about 45 minutes or so. (using 3g)- About 15 minutes of email checking, responded to 1 email.- About 40 minutes of listening to MP3s from the external speaker and headset (about 20 mins each)- Some minor things (like alarm clock settings, used the alarm this morning, synching emails manually a couple of times, turning on/off 4G, using Advanced task manager to shut off applications that start running in the background, etc)The rest of the time, say around 20 hours, it's been in idle.Currently the phone has been off the charger for just over 25 hours. And the battery use says:Remaining charge: 27%Standby: 49%Display: 19%Voice calls: 14%Phone idle: 13%Media server: 4%Android system: 2%The good news is that you can make it last about 30 hours with light use. But you do give up a lot of the functionality that makes the phone special. (syncing constantly).If you are playing games, and listening to music, it will last about 4 hours. The one day I played a game for like an hour, the 'display' indicator said the screen had used 55% of the battery (out of 6 hours unplugged). With medium use and no optimizations (other than lower screen brightness) I had to charge twice a day, it really wouldn't last much. At work without using the phone it lost about 50% of the battery life for example. (not even 1 text, that was simply the phone synching things and connecting/reconnecting to 4g/3g by itself. Note - I am beside a window and have strong 3g signal.Another advice - given how much battery life the screen uses, I'd recommend changing whatever applications you can to use a dark theme (and by dark I mean black). Basically black background with light text. Same with your background image.2. Not Epic specific but Android as a whole - apps sucking memory all the time, no way to close them other than by downloading a custom application. I'm not sure what the point of it is, or why they are doing it, but that's the route Google decided to go with Android.3. VGA front camera (spending just a couple of dollars more would have allowed it to have a 1.3MP camera so that it works better with all the apps coming up - skype. It is lower resultion than the screen of this phone, making video chat look bad... Not sure why they didn't spend the extra money on the better front facing camera (the EVO has a 1.3 one for example)4. Currently no app in Android to combine chat/sms/im in a single location. I couldn't even find anything in the 90k + apps in the Android market. Basically, the Palm Pre (and Blackberry as well) you open up a Contact to chat, and you have all the text messages and instant messages from google talk, facebook chat, etc. So you can follow the whole conversation you've had with someone. In Android (and the custom layer added by the many manufactureres, in this case touchwiz is lacking such a feature. You may not think it's a big deal, but it's what I miss the most about my Pre - thought it's close between that and the ability to close applications and true multitasking - webOS (palm pre's) card system is light years ahead of what anyone iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian)5. Cannot change 'most used' icons on the bottom of the phone. This one falls on Samsung and their touchwiz user interface. I like the fact that they let you keep 4 icons on every one of the 7 home screens, so no matter where you are you have quick access to the Phone, Contacts, Text Messages App, and the all application icon. While convenient, those happen to NOT be my most used apps. In fact, only 1 of those 3 are. And Sprint/Samsung decided to not let you choose which are your 'most used' applications. Here is to hoping they realize how backwards that is, and actually release a patch that lets you choose those applications. (Like say: email, web browser...)UPDATE 10/03/10 (more on battery life)I have slowly started enabling more services (turned background synch on, not running 'advanced task killer' as much) but have kept the Juice Defender on. I must say, that the phone does quite well in general just with the Juice Defender. I have been getting about 50 hours with very light use, and have had no problem with my regular use to charge around noon each day. In fact, it usually has about 35-40% charge left then. The big trick is juice defender - basically the phone is incredibly efficient when in idle - a lot more so than any other Android phone. Samsung is doing something quite well with it's processor during that time. Today before charging it up, that phone had been unplugged for 54 hours, and still had 12% of battery left. Again, this is light use. When using it constantly, (say watching a couple of movies for example) the battery will be gone completely. Basically Juice Defender is awesome, the free version is plenty, but I am going to purchase the pro version of the app just as a thank you for the developer. It really has made the phone usable for a couple of days with light use, something I thought impossible when I first purchased it.UPDATE 10/14/10 (battery...)After the latest firmware update, battery drainage while idle became really poor again, maybe worse than ever. The main culprit according to the indicators is 'cellphone standby', I have tried all the normal tricks without luck, it's draining about 4% per hour while on idle (3g is disabled, screen is off, nothing can sync during this time) I have tried multiple things, but ended up finding a running DRM service introduced with samsung media hub recently, shutting this off improved this after a phone reset. Note - Media hub enables this service in the background and it connects every 11 seconds to a server, so it keeps your phone processor from sleeping as well as keeping your data connection turning on. I must say that despite disabling this, the phone is still not as efficient as I had it before, but at least good enough again. Again, it's another reason to consider going HTC (EVO) over Samsung (Epic) - HTC is working harder on Android software updates, and don't have a DRM service running in the background killing your battery life.Now for the positive things:1. SpeedThe device is simply fast. With 4g on (or using wifi), it feels like I'm on a PC browsing the web. Pages load within a couple of seconds. It feels about 3-4 times faster than the Palm Pre. It consistently took about 1 or 2 less seconds than the EVO on my tests. This cannot be understated for me, since this is one of the 2 big reasons I chose it over the EVO. I use it for most of my web needs. Opening apps is quick, etc.2. 4G - it's faster than the wifi (2mbs) I use at home, so it feels very fast. Obviously it's just starting so I don't get the super high speeds, but it's about 2-3 times faster than 3G in my area. Unfortunately as I said, it's only available downtown in my area. But still, they say by year end it'll be covering most of the area. We'll see. I feel like I am a bit more ready for the future with 4G, if speeds increase I'll have the benefit already.UPDATE 10/11/10: You can actually see tiny little pixels on the screen if you look hard enough. I don't mind them, but some people do. For comparison purposes, you cannot easily distinguish pixels on the EVO, the iPhone 4, and most other high resolutions phones. This is strictly an issue with the Super Amoled screens.3. Screen. You can read it anywhere, see it anywhere. Even diehard EVO fans cannot claim thire screen is better. It's basically a fact that this screen is the best on the market. iPhone 4 has a higher resolution, but color saturation and black levels are just stunning. Watch a movie on this phone vs anything else and there is just no comparison. Not saying EVO and iPhone screens are bad, it's just that this one is superb.4. Applications. (Android in general) I couldn't get an app for my bank on the Palm Pre, it's in Android. Then you have the barcode scanner to check prices, google goggles to see information on landmarks by taking a picture (claims 80% accuracy) and more. The integration with Google Voice is simply awesome. You can just select it to use it on international calls, so you just dial directly to your friends/family abroad and pay GoogleVoice rates (really cheap) while using your regular phone app. It's very seamless.Conclusion:You really can't go wrong with the new phones out there. Android OS has matured enough, and these phones are premium products. The Epic's screen and speed makes it stand out from the crowd enough to give it a slight nod above everything else out there. Android though, lacks the unity/polishness of webOS (Palm Pre) or iOS (iPhone) but makes up for it with the effort Google is putting to optimize the speed, the integration with google service, and freedoms for developers to create applications with few restrictions. This phone leverages all of it very well. It also provides a physical keyboard for those who want it (it is very big and easy to type on). I wouldn't recommend this phone for 'work use' because if you constantly need to be synching and retrieving emails/calendar updates while you are in meetings (and any areas with low signal strength) it will blow through your battery life and you will be an unhappy customer. But for personal use, it's among the best cellphones, if not the best, out there.",4
"At first I was superbly impressed. I immediately took it to NYC and everything worked great....4G was awesome, surfed easily, and it did pretty much everything I thought it would. Now, after having it for 9 months it has become very buggy, and I think it started with the update to android froyo about 3 months ago. I used to get great life out of the battery, but now it runs down in 12 hours without even using it unless I turn off all background data. The battery runs down faster without having anything on...so I have wifi or bluetooth on and it actually saves the battery....I am telling the whole truth. I used to get 2 days use out of it...no kidding. So I get a full day still with background data off.There are so many things these phones can do now that I basically compare it to a netbook or computer...it does it all really, and more. I have an ipad2 that sucks compared to my phone....really now.Since the update to 2.2 this constantly shuts down, and just locks up like my old computers used to....really really annoying. After the update I was supposed to be able to use hands free bluetooth except the voice recognition truly sucks....its unusable really, at least on my phone. I have a few hundred contacts in my phone, so not sure if that is causing the confusion.For the most part it does its job, but every now and then it locks up at the wrong time and that is ultimately annoying. Paying 100 bucks a month for a phone, this thing should sizzle in all aspects. Its good, but could be much better.Emails are great, and surfing is great if close to tower...even in 3G. Also the 4G is not at my home....but I have to travel to use it. I have found 4G soso...not as great as I expect as you have to apparently be in direct line with a tower.It is very versatile all in all, but there is plenty of room for improvement. I think it was the cream of the crop for a while, now not so much and I think someone dropped the ball on the updates....maybe a new strategy to sell phones? I would give it a 65 or 70 out of 100....when I first got it I would have given it a 90 and given it 4 1/2 stars.UPDATE 11/26/11...Gingerbread FixesThe 2.3 update saved this phone. I now have double battery time at least....maybe 3x. No more random shutdowns, everything works. I now can re-recommend this!",3
"Rather than give a lengthy review, I'll simply compare the phone to the Evo (which my wife has) and the iPhone 3GS, which we both just dropped.Pros of Epic 4G Over iPhone 3GSGorgeous larger screen (I think it's better looking than the 'retinal display' on the iPhone 4)Data connections are more consistant (streaming works well over 3G, something I never had in Louisville with AT&T;)Swype (an ingenious way of sliding from letter to letter to enter text) and keyboard provide superior data entry optionsSignal lock seems betterContacts more easily sync with Facebook and other cloud options4G speeds (where available)More customizable.Apps are often more quirky and not as restricted as Apple'sCamera is much better with more options.User accessible memory card.Can display video, pictures and music over DLNASprint plans are often cheaper for more features.Cons of Epic 4G Over iPhone 3GSBattery charging is SLOW when phone is turned on.Fewer apps available and many are less developed than the iPhone equivalent (Facebook and Evernote are two I find disappointing)Phone is heavier and less compactAndroid updates are up to carrier and manufacturer, so your phone may receive OS later than another android phone.Phone doesn't have automatic dictionary for non Swype entry.Pros of Epic 4G over Sprint's HTC EvoMore comfortable form factorDisplay is much sharper and more colorfulSwype is preinstalledSlideout keyboardSprint's Touchwiz Android Interface is more like iPhone than the Evo's SenseCamera has more fun features out of the box and takes better pictures (in my experience)Camera button on phone itself.Better graphic processor.Lighter phoneComes with headphonesTop loading USB port with sliding cover (note:  Some hate this, some love it.)Cons  Epic 4G compared to Sprint's HTC EvoFewer case optionsBattery life seems to be less (YMMV)Slower to chargeEvo seems more solid since it is one pieceEvo looks more impressive to outsidersSense UI from HTC has more widgets and options available and is less locked down than TouchwizRuns Android 2.1 and not 2.2.Overall, I love my Epic 4G.  It's a well built phone and I prefer it over the Evo.  If you're switching to Sprint, both are great phones to choose from.  You may want to wait until the 4G has the bugs worked out since it just came out last week.UPDATE 1/2/2012 -- Reduced from 4 stars to 1 star.My wife's Evo has given her no problems besides a lack of storage space (primarily due to clutter of apps she rarely uses).Me... not so lucky.  After months of waiting for Gingerbread 2.2 update (which my wife had forever on her Evo) I was greeted with some new surprises, not the least of which are horrible battery life and a GPS that now refuses to work, even on a clear day.  According to the Sprint support sites and many Android phone sites, I am not alone in these problems, nor does there appear to be a simple or permanent fix for most people.  I've always bought Samsung products because they appear to offer good value, but recent experiences including this one have made me realize Samsung is great at promoting the new, and terrible about supporting the old.  My wife's Evo and my old iPhone 3GS, whatever their faults, worked.  The Epic 4G is a great looking phone with horrible software support.  Not recommended.",1
"I'm going to keep this review short and simple.  I switched over to the HTC EVO but returned it because it felt just a bit too big in my hand.  The other fact was it did not have SWYPE nor did it have a real keyboard.  I thought I would get used to having a virtual keyboard but I could not get used to it.However the Samsung Epic 4G is a great phone since it has SWYPE which works surprisingly well as well as a slide out keyboard. There have been some complaints about how the keys are not offset and I do find it a bit harder to type on it having been used to the Blackberry 9700 which was my previous phone.The phone is very responsive, battery life is not that great, you have to definitely charge it after 8-10 hours of moderate use.  I usually have 4G and GPS turned off (I don't have 4G in Sacramento) or that would use up the battery faster.I was able to connect to my Outlook email at work without any problems and it pushes the email to your Android just like the Blackberry does and it also syncs your Outlook Calender.Pinch to zoom works within Email and on Web pages and its very responsive.The killer feature is the support of DLNA, so I can view my video, audio and picture files on my PC over WI-FI on my Samsung Epic and it works seamlessly.  I can also stream video, audio and pictures from the Epic to my PC or my LG DLNA enabled Blue Ray player so that I can view it on my TV.Google Voice integration seems to be better than on the Blackberry.  Overall this phone is very intuitive to use, I had a bit more trouble with the HTC EVO.I also was able to install YouMail from the Android app store and set up conditional call forwarding (see the Youmail website on instructions since Sprint is slightly different).  While Visual Voicemail is available with Sprint, I prefer YouMail.Overall I have to say I am very pleased with this phone and would definitely recommend it.Having used Swype on this phone and finding it so easy to use, I wonder if I needed the keyboard after all.  I still wanted it as a crutch until I can let go.  This phone runs Android 2.1If you are a Blackberry user and are hesitant to switch, then I can honestly say that coming to this phone from a Blackberry 9700 it took a couple of days to get used to it, but I was able to do everything on this phone and much more.  Also due to RIM not releasing Blackberry OS 6 to existing Blackberry 9700 customers until next year even though its available for their new phone, I felt it was time to make the switch.The only app that I miss that is only available on the Blackberry is VIIGO, but I use Newsrob instead which seems adequate though not as nice as VIIGO.Update: 9/13/2010I got to use the Navigation feature and it works great.  I was able to say the name of the place I wanted to go and it began navigation right away.  The default voice sounds a bit funny and sometimes difficult to understand since the street names don't often get pronounced correctly.  I especially like the Satellite view mode since I can actually see the buildings, and I like how it switches to Street view when you are close to your destination.",5
"BEFORE YOU READ BELOW PLEASE READ THIS: Make sure you set aside time to play with this. Your girlfriend or wife is going to hate you for it if you don't. ......haha..trust me I learned from experience.I was a blackberry user for years, and I never wanted to switch. But I wanted to see what 4G was like. Sprint is testing 4G in many more markets than are on their website (Many places in the San Francisco area and Los Angeles). Here is a break down of the pros and cons1. Once you get use to 'Swype' typing, you'll never use the keyboard. I bought this phone becaue of the physical keyboard (since I came from a blackberry) but I never use it. 'Swype' is great. Go look up a video.2. Battery life is pretty good despite what people say. Since the Amoled screen does not use power with black pixels. I made my wallpaper solid black. Improved battery life drastically. Trust me on this! .....Now if you use 4G it drains your battery quickly. See below. Also charging time takes a long time. It takes maybe twice as long to fully charge this phone than a blackberry and the MaH is only slightly stronger (1500). Use the 'Power Widget' to very easily turn on/off things like 4G, Wifi, Adjut brightness. This will help greatly.3. 4G..It drains your battery, and mean quickly. God's honest truth......3G is fast enough. I mean 4G was cool to test out, but it really doesn't make a difference when browsing. Maybe downloading music or video (yes) but how often do you do that. When it comes to apps and browsing 3G is fast enough. I teathred my phone to my laptop, and the 4G speeds were barely faster than 3G. 3G speeds were about 1MB per second download. 4G was 1.2.  Now if you run a network speedtest on the phone at [...], it's fast...4-5 MbPS.3. Customization - Awesome, nothing like it. I love it. No complaints. You'll love it.4. Feel of the phone - Overall a little too thick for me. Once you add it the protective case, that thing aint goin in your pocket. It makes it to thick. So if you like a thin phone, this one is not for you. As I mentioned above, with the 'Swype' technology you'll never find yourself using a keyboard. The keyboard also 'wiggles' around a bit.....5. Charging Port - Kinda funny that's its on top of the phone, but not a big deal.6. Bluetooth - Great Quality (3.0 BT technology). Good reception from a number of Bluetooth pieces I've tried. It's also cool streaming podcasts /music to your bluetooh. Cool feature.7. Apps - App market is great. Again customizing this phone is one of the greatest features. Apps will randomly start for some reason. I don't know if they suck up battery life or cpu usage. The sprint guy told me they don't.8. Unlocking the phone - PHone has an auto lock. You have to touch the power button and then slide the screen to unlock. Get an app on the market for this called 'Screen Mode' to customize this. Now I can lock / unlock my phone by just hitting a button.9. Youtube videos are great to watch on here you can watch them in HQ. Sometimes when you do, you'll have to reset your phone for it to work. I know it sounds funny, but this is a minor flaw. Youtube in HQ is great!10. E-mail and Web Browsing. Seamlessly hooked up to my company's exchange. So much more superior than using a blackberry in that regard. The way you can view the e-mails and attachments are great. Also synced with Yahoo and Gmail. Again. Awesome. No complaints.11. Web Browsing - NO other phone like it! plain and simple it's great.12. The google search feature. I know this is available on other droid phones. But the voice activated or type features are awesome!13. Phone reception / quality - Perfect.Overall. If you can get over the thickness you'll love it.",4
"I have learned to hate everything about this phone over the past two years. It powers down for no reason, can't seem to stay connected to 4g or GPS, over heats and the battery life is atrocious. I am now on my second one of this brand. The first one's circuit board stopped working, effectively bricked. Sprint sent me a refurb that barely works. The best thing about it is the TARDIS skin that I have put on it.",2
"I really liked it so much and it is working fine with me knowing that I am a heavy user to my Blackberry Torch mobile phone and I ordered it once more for my wife.I recommend it to any Blackberry Torch users, I think its better than the original.",5
"Haven't had to use the new battery yet, hope it is in working order when I do.  I was happy I found one at Amazon.com",4
"Works sometime and sometimes it does not.  Not recommending it....  Feels cheap in your hands, better off just switching batteries when you need to.",2
"This battery revived my phone! It fit as it was supposed to, my phone recognized it and it worked like new.",5
"I would have never bought a battery for my aging Blackberry for 50 bucks. But for under 10 bucks this was a great deal, so I keep on using my Blackberry.",5
"I keep a couple of these fully charged for my 9810 Torch. They come in handy when you're not near an outlet to charge your phone, perfect for ballgames, family outings, etc.",5
"I was surprised when mine arrived. It clearly shows that there is a micro USB input port in the Amazon photo. Mine has a standard male USB port and is an output not an input. Mine plugs directly into the wall via a foldaway 2 prong standard electrical connection. I would have preferred the item that I could use on my desk but given some of the poor reviews of that model, I may just keep this model is it does not feel light or cheaply made. The light is a rather obnoxious blue LED but it is not a deal breaker. I have only had this a few hours but so far, it seems to be working fine. Mine also came with anew FS1 battery.",3
"Yes, I would recommend this product. We go through lots of batteries where I'm employed, and the price for these is within my budget!",5
"BE CAREFUL!! THIS IS A CHEAP CHINESE KNOCKOFF BATTERY AND IS NOT A GENUINE BLACKBERRY BATTERY.  Even though the photo of the battery looks like a genuine battery, and the battery they ship looks just like the photo, this is not a genuine battery.  They include a 'dongle' that you have to use to 'chip' your battery to fool the BlackBerry into accepting it as genuine.I'm not sure how they get away with using the BlackBerry label and seal on the battery...smells like fraud or copyright infringement to me.",1
"Amazing what a new battery will do, added another year to the life of my phone (since I needed to charge it up every 3 hours with the original 2 year old battery). Now this lasts all day (or most, depending how much I use it)",5
Everything was there. The whole one battery. Lol. Words absolutely great in my n e w ph one. I love it.,5
"Have you ever wondered how many gadgets you actually own that use USB power to recharge?  Via computer USB port or by USB wall adapter, off the top of my head I can count five.  This is only the electronics I regularly use and not taking to account my family's gadgets.  My iPhone, digital camera, video camera, iPad, and GPS are the items I am constantly recharging.  You don't even want me to tell you how many different chargers, docks or portable battery packs I have  -  let's just say I could probably start my own portable toxic sulfuric acid cloud.Everyone knows GREEN is better.  This is where the sCharger-5 comes in.  Unlike electricity, the sun is free and out there for everyone to use and take advantage of.  So far we have used the sCharger-5 in our boat, convertible and out camping.  I know there will be hundreds of other uses for it.  The included storage/carrying bag is a great way for carrying small accessories such as cords and protecting the solar panel while traveling.  The solar panel is lightweight and folds in half.  I also acquired the sCharger grip tripod (you can get directly from Suntactics website).  The tripod is ideal for keeping the solar panel off the ground and keeps it completely open to get the most sunlight.You can even use the solar panel as you are using the device.  Just make sure you have DIRECT sunlight since solar panels use their own charge and redistribute that charge to your device.  They actually are not recharging your device.  The sunlight is recharging the solar panel and the solar panel is then using it's charge to 'rejuvenate' your battery.  An example of charging time, it brought back my dead iPhone 5 to a full charge in about 1 hour and 45 minutes.With solar batteries you no longer have to worry about being near a power source or have to make sure to have plenty of external battery packs charged.  Now you have the freedom to be where ever you want and do whatever you want and take all your USB rechargeable gadgets with you.What about emergency power if your cell phone dies?  Ever been out of power for hours because of a wind or snow storm?  Thought about the Zombie Apocalypse?  You can be ready those times of disaster!  How about on vacation and laying out on the beach and reading from your eReader?  Plenty of sun to take advantage of there.Definitely a must have item for a person with many gadgets.  Suntactics has great customer service and very personable.  MADE IN THE USA.DISCLOSURE:  I was given a sample to test and evaluate in exchange for an honest unbiased review.",5
"I really enjoy using this solar panel, made well, good charging ability, portable, many other good qualities. a good camping panel, also a good 'beginner' panel as well.",5
"This isn't your run of the mill cheap charger. This thing means business!  I carry it with me into the field for charging my Smartphone. It really puts out the power. And in direct sun, watch out! Very well built. Just plug any standard USB cord into the socket and charge. Great for overnight hiking trips too.  I keep it &#34;deployed&#34; on my backpack, and trickle charge my devices. Great for GPS mapping hikes and the like, even if you don't plan on being able to use the cell out in the wilderness. And, great customer support too!",5
"It charges directly USB to your device. The manual ensures you that it will work with apple devices, even when the device says it is not charging. Leaving it in direct sunlight the charger will eventually charge an iPad, iPod, etc. or USB anything.The panels themselves are great quality. Very simple, just the high density, hard folding plastic and the USB port.Definitely recommend for any cabin or otherwise remote locale.",5
"Just bought this based on its high ratings; and haven't yet had time to give it a good try.  First impression: it appears to be well constructed (in the USA to boot) though smaller than I expected.  I'm presuming its relatively high price is due to its capability - time will tell.  But for the price, a case should be included.  Also, a small sturdy stand and a couple of hanging rings or holes would be convenientUpdate: haven't taken this on the road yet, but at home I'm using it to charge the battery that came with my Voltaic solar charger because the sCharger-5 is quicker.  So far it's a keeper; but again for this price I'd expect a protective case for this brittle panel.  And how difficult would it have been to make this with dual USB ports?",4
"I have gotten a few solar powered chargers and have been consistently disappointed. I guess this is as good as it gets when it comes to portable solar chargers which isn't saying much. I do like its portability and two panels. Also, while I like that it can directly charge something via USB, I don't like how it doesn't come with some kind of battery period. They advertise this like it's some kind of bonus or something...the fact that it doesn't come with something?? For as expensive as it is, you would think it would come with some kind of external battery to connect. That way you can still have the concept of not having to wait for an internal battery to charge before being able to charge your device, but you have to option of charging an external battery if you want as well.I think I might have had high expectations for this thing as I have been so gravely disappointed with other solar chargers in the past. But even this, the best one I've found thus far, still will charge a portable battery in the sun all day and not even put a dent in it. I mean, not even 10%. But maybe that is just to be expected of all solar chargers I suppose... So I give it three stars. It is the best I've found, but not the best it could  be.",3
"I ordered this to use in park, remote country side, lakes, or anywhere I need to charge my iPhone. The product sometime it charges and sometime it would say it would not recognize the devise charging. Now it doesn't charge anything. $150 was down in the drain.",2
"ThesCharger-5solar charging kit is the perfect solution for a variety of uses. With support for a variety of devices (Apple and Android alike), the versatility of this solar charger is impressive.In the package, you will find:(1) sCharger-5 solar cell(1) Grip bracket with a gripping tripod(1) USB dongle for use with picky Samsung/Nexus devices(1) Soft carrying pouch for the sCharger-5The unit is very easy to setup and get going.  After opening the solar panel and pointing at light, the green indicator on the back illuminates to let you know you are now collecting solar power for output.  The unit features one USB port that you can use with cables you already have.  Neither my Nexus 7 nor Galaxy S III had any issue working with this solar charger.This kit is easy to store for travel or even for emergency situations.  After a devastating event like a tornado or earthquake, often the sun still shines even when your power outlet may not work.  After making all those important calls, the last thing you want to deal with is a dead cell battery.For camping this is a great product.  You can keep the solar panel outside of the tent and keep your device inside out of the sun.  The construction of this panel is excellent. It's quite lightweight and doesn't get as hot in direct sunlight as you might imagine.Generally, thesCharger-5solar charging kit is great for the environmental-friendly, or for those who need power on the go.  The panel appears quite durable and functions as expected.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review. A review in exchange for the review sample was not promised. The views and opinions expressed in this review are my own, and in no way represent the views or opinions of the manufacturer or vendor.",5
"I bought this solar charger so I could charge my phone while camping. It works fine when the sun is bright and the day isn't cloudy (So Cal), but doesn't work when it's grey and cloudy out (Seattle). It's light enough to carry in a backpack and pretty sturdy too. I was able to cahrge my phone several times with this unit though it does take a bit longer.",4
"I charge mi Trent Battery Source with this solar charger, and i can also charge my Galaxy S3(not at the same time though).  Its just great but, be advised, you need to buy an special bag or something to carry your cellphone stuff on, because this product is delivered in a box, no cover/bag at all....  So, one star less...",4
Great Holster for the cover.  Phone easilt slips in out but still firm fit.  No problems with case or damage.,5
I used it for 2 weeks the it stopped holding the phone on any position it would just spin from horizontal position. And vertical :(,2
"The clip can't be used with any iPhone4's that have any form of a screen cover on it.. ie: I also with this clip bought a mirror screen cover and when I tried the clip with the screen cover on it just kept peeling the cover off because it clip is so 'form fitting' to the iPhone that its not meant to be used with any other physical after market accessories or add-on's to the iPhone.-Really wish I knew this before hand, I wouldn't have purchased this clip.",3
THOUGHT I WAS PURCHASING FOR AN I -PHONE 3 BUT IT ENDED UP BEING FOR A 4. SO I HAD TO GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY WHO HAD THAT KIND OF PHONE,3
Doesnt fit phone. I wouldnt recommend it at all. Now my son plays with it so I guess I get some use outta it lol,1
"Worked just fine. It did the job and was easy to install. Bubbles were a little hard to remove, but okay.",3
"At first this case looks so fine, and the after a while having it on your iphone it starts loosing that silver look it becomes yellowish which looks very ugly.",1
It was good wile it lasted. But like three days after I got it I was taking it out of my pocket and the whole side of it ripped off,3
"looks cool, good accessory but lousy protection, this will not do much for you if you drop your phone, good for minor scrapes and scratches though",5
"I got the Gray one and it looks great, it changes completely the look of my iphone 4. It has nothing on top or bottom in the front, so it does not scratch my ears like other ones.... It's very thin so it fits in my leather case. I love it!",5
"I purchase cases for our companies fleet of iPhones.  I have tried many other types and brands of cases and was using the iFrogz brand before i found these.  They fit the phone nicely, are just 'sticky' enough to not fall out of your hand while using, and are perfect for sliding in and out of your pants pocket without binding.  The holes on the back of the case allow for more heat to escape when using power-hungry apps like navigation and streaming.I typically order the black color and have really liked it, but decided to try the silver version this time.  While over all the case is ok, the silver looks cheaper in quality than the black.  The feel is the same, but the silver is slightly transparent and doesnt look as good on the black iPhone.  It looks more like a toy than a case.The only overall design flaw, in my opinion, is the part of the case by the volume/silent switch.  The design leaves a thin strip of plastic along the edge closest to the screen.  In a vast majority of phone cases coming back to me for replacement, this is where it cracks first.  Some people live with it for a while until it starts getting annoying by binding on clothes or snaps off completly.All in all, I'd give it 4 stars because of the fit, design, and price, but I'm subtracting another star because of the silver color.  This is our new standard in our office.  Just make sure you have a backup when the thin corner piece breaks, and it probably will.",3
"Obviously, choosing a case for your phone is a personal decision. I assume you are reading these reviews because you like the styling of this product. I agree with other reviewers that the protection offered here is not on par with other cases that could be purchased but if you had a hard shell case you would look like an incompetent dweeb who breaks expensive electronics and should probably be wearing a helmet at all times. As such, you would not have made it to these reviews at all. Assuming this, you can be assured this is a nice case. It has a tight fit and keeps the slim lines of the phone. It protects both sides as you can see in the picture and leaves most of the top and bottom ends open but does overlap at the edges to provide a buffer against direct impact. Again, it leaves the face open but wraps around the edge on the sides so that if you leave the phone face down, the surface touches the case and not the phone directly, leaving a few millimeters between the surface and the glass. The holes cut for the front and side line up perfectly with the phone. I charged my phone with the case on and did not feel any increased heat as a result. For the money and styling this is a good looking case that offers limited protection for adult use.",4
"Not a ton of protection, as stated in other reviews.  Looks nice though!  It was a bit tough to get situated with my screen protector on.  Good first case for my new VZW IP4.Overall 4/5.",4
Boke within a week? The part by the volume control broke in my purse ... Why can't they make things worth the $$,1
Thanks to the previous post and a quality product description I ordered this case for my partner. So far it seems like a good case for anyone looking for a combination of silicon and clear crystal hard case. The silicon around the edge buffers the phone from bumps and the hard part buffers it from scratches. It arrived quickly with standard shipping and he was off and running with it.,5
"I am not commenting on the durability of this case, since I just got it today, but it is a great match for my white EVO, as it lets the dazzle of the white back show through.  Nice. The case LOOKS stellar.My only complaint is the main reason I bought the case.  The phone is too slippery without a case - you simply HAVE to have a case for this phone or it WILL eventually slip from your hands.  This case adds a little bit of tackiness to help keep it from slipping, but the back is too hard and smooth, and it will still slide around on a smooth surface.  This is a problem if you need to set it on the dash as you drive, or place it on the arm of an easy chair for example.  It really needs a more 'rubberized' or tacky finish all around.I'll try this a little longer, but I may end up going with a more conventional silicone case, which will probably absorb falls a bit better, too.",4
"This was the first case I bought for my Evo.  Having TPU around the edges is better than silicone in my opinion because it TPU does not attract lint.  Having a clear back was nice too, because it preserved the original looks of the phone.But...This case is difficult to put on and even harder to take off.  In fact, the TPU surround tore away from the clear back as I was attempting to remove the case.  Removing the case was a struggle because it fits tightly (fitting tightly is not a bad thing though).  The TPU is clearly not adhered well enough.I was also not satisfied that the camera was protected.  When in this case, the camera lens is flush with the clear back, meaning the lens would still be resting on the table if I set the phone down with the phone's back facing the table.",3
"This case is perfect.  It's exactly what I need.  So I'm very frustrated that it just fell apart.I got it at the beginning of October.  It's December 16th, and the black sides of the case just came free of the clear back.  I'd understand this if I'd abused the phone and the case, but it spends most of the day sitting on a desk.  To carry it with me I slip it into a cargo pocket.  There's nothing else in that pocket, since I don't want to damage the screen.  There are a few scuff marks on the back of the case, but very little wear.  I never removed the phone from the case and it fit well right up to the moment when it fell apart.Everything I wrote in the previous review is true: the case is slim, it fits well, it doesn't change the look of the phone, buttons are easy to push through the case.  It's really the perfect case for me.  But I do need it to last more than 10 weeks.I'm moving on to aSeidio Innocase. Too bad.Old (October) review:I was a little nervous about buying this case since it had no reviews, but thought I'd give it a try.  So far I'm glad I did.I haven't dropped the phone (yet,) so if (when) I do, I'll update the review then.  These are initial impressions.The case didn't really change the look of my phone at all.  It's got a slightly raised lip around the screen, so when I put the phone down face-down, the screen doesn't come into contact with the table at all.  The sides seem thick enough to protect against normal abuse.  The back is clear and beginning to accumulate scratches which can only be seen when I hold the phone at a sharp angle so the light reflects off the case.  In normal conditions it looks undamaged.  The case is smooth plastic and slides quickly and easily out of my pocket.Everything that requires access can be used through holes in the case, except for the power button.  For that, the case has a thin, raised spot that I thought would be difficult to use, but it's very easy--almost no extra force is required.The case was very easy to put on, but is difficult to remove.  Since I don't have a reason to remove it, I never do.I haven't had it for long, but so far it doesn't seem to be stretching or losing its shape at all.I'll update this review if there are problems later on, but for now, this case is perfect for me.",1
"In the pictures it looked like a solid product and it had the overall rating to back it up. However, this was far less quality than whet I was expecting. I was hoping to just buy one, well made armband instead of multiple of the $3 ones. Upon opening the packaging ([just a bag] cheap packaging as well) I was severely disappointed. It seems to fit naked phones better than ones in a case, like mine.",3
"The plastic piece is now coming out and actually crumpling up. I don't wear this and let music just go. I use pandora and often have to turn up/down volume, change songs, text (all of the while working out) and the plastic has now rendered the case almost unusable. Getting another one at this point and won't go with this again.If you never touch the phone once you put it on, it would be fine. I had no problems otherwise.",2
my husband bought this for his phone to work out at the rec center and it works well.  It stays on and doesn't move around and he is able to work out with it.,5
"After trying a cheaper armband that claimed to be big enough for my Droid X, I was sorely disappointed.  This one, however, was perfect!  The Droid X fits inside snugly, and the opening used to slide it in provides plenty of space for a headphone cord.  The strap should be just the right length for most anyone, unless you have REALLY beefy arms.  Mine are rather large, and this thing fits fine!",5
I use this main when doing yard work.  It works well with my phone and keeps everything secure and protected.  My only issue is that it is a little tight.  I am not a small guy by i am not mr universe either.  I have a hard time getting it only.  if the strap would be an inch long this would not be an issue.  As it is know i have about 1/4&#34; of strap that sticks through the plastic loop. this something hard to grab.  The cord hold on the other side is nice and keep the excess out of the way,4
"Wore it the first time while cleaning the garage. I had my Jabra Sport Bluetooth headphones on. It was so comfortable that after two hours of cleaning the garage, I spent ten minutes looking for my phone!  Ohhh yea, it's on my arm!It's easy to put on, works through the plastic screen and goes in and out easily. Taking it out is easy if you remember to separate the clear plastic cover from the phone.Thanks for the great product!",5
"I've been using this product for about 6 months now.  It fits my EVO 4G nicely (though I do have the remove the phone from its other cover in order to use it in the Tune Belt).I have used this on runs from 2 miles to 10 miles.  I have worn it on my bare arm and over long-sleeved shirts.  I am petite, so it fits, but I can definitely see how runners with bigger biceps would need the extender!  I don't sweat much but this thing definitely gets damp on longer runs.  It isn't bad enough that it damages my phone, but I have hand-washed it in the sink a few times to freshen it up.  (Just let it air dry and it's good to go!)I am happy with this purchase and will buy another one after this one wears out, though that doesn't seem to be happening any time soon.",5
"My husband and I both use this, but with different complaints.  His arms are too big for it to fit so he needs to order the extender.  Not really a product flaw.  For me, it fits well but after about 10 minutes of jogging it rubs near my arm pit raw.  It's not loose, not too tight.  Just uncomfortable.  Guess I will be trying a different brand.",3
"i bought this because i didn't want to have to take my iphone out of its case every time i ran. this case isn't a perfect fit, but it does the job. i can still use the touch screen but there's a bit of a gap (just have to press harder). glad i can use my iphone in its case. i have a speck pixel case on my iphone, also fit with amazon basics case. used griffin reveal case -it fit, but the rubber was a little catchy trying to slide it in so i went for the speck case",5
"I was kind of weary about ordering this due to some of the negative reviews, but so far it is perfect! I've used this with and without a screen protector (The Steinheil Crystal) and there is no difference; it slides in easily and securely either way. The screen is also fully functional, which is a huge plus. I gave a 5 on comfort; the only thing that is NOT comfortable is the fact that the phone is huge (and as a female, I have fairly small arms) this is obviously no fault of the armband. In fact, the Tune Belt does a fantastic job of making a massive phone as comfortable as possible. As far as protecting the phone from sweat, I can't imagine if you're dripping buckets none will get through. I personally try to stick to exercising in the cooler parts of the day anyway, so it's not an issue for me. If you're out at the hottest part of the day and naturally sweaty, I would proceed with caution.",5
"I use this thing EVERYTIME I run, it stays in place & fits my phone like a glove! It also keeps my phone clean & dry even in a light rain or lots of sweating.",5
I got this specifically to use with my iPhone 4 but I wanted to leave the case on it.  My wife and I have different cases but it works with both of our phones flawlessly.  I would totally recommend this product to folks with an iPhone 4 who want to use it to run and retain the ability to leave their phone in the case when exercising.,5
"My iPhone 5s with a standard slim fit case fits perfectly in here. Easy enough to slide in and out, but it remains pretty secure once inside the armband. Armband is big enough to fit around 15-16 inch biceps comfortably. You're able to use the touch screen through the plastic shield on the armband, but obviously the thumb print touch ID won't work.The little cable spool on the side isn't as functional as it appears in the pictures. I also wish the headphone hole was on the other side - it seems upside down to me, but maybe I'm using it incorrectly.Overall I'd recommend this armband simply because it keeps sweat out, which is the biggest risk to mitigate when it comes to running with a $600 gadget on your arm.",4
"This case seems more bulky than expected, the phone is difficult to remove from the pouch since the plastic sticks to the screen.  The phone screen is not usable while in the pouch.  Other than that the case serves its purpose.  My husband sweats quite a bit and hasn't had any problems with getting the phone wet while running.  He says it does stay on his arm well.",3
"I bought this for my wife 2 years ago, and it's still going strong. She was originally running with a Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G (the version with the slide-out keyboard), and this fit her phone very well. She has since upgraded to a Galaxy S3, which just BARELY fits into the Tune Belt if she takes her phone out of its case. The top of the phone is slightly exposed because it can't slide down in the pocket far enough for the cloth to close up against the back of the Tune Belt, but it's still very snug and she's never had any problem with it coming out of the case while either biking or running. Speaking of which, she says the Tune Belt is extremely comfortable for doing both. It's one of her favorite phone accessories she's ever owned.Since the Galaxy S3 and the newer S4 are right at the same size, it ought to fit the S4 if you really need it to, but I'd recommend getting theTune Belt Sport Armband for Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and moreif you have a 5' or slightly larger phone, as it ought to fit down inside the armband better than this one. But if you already own this armband and are wondering, 'Will my new Galaxy S4 fit?' the answer is 'not perfectly, but well enough that you don't HAVE to upgrade to a new one.'",5
"I've used this for about two weeks in the gym and on one three-mile run. My Droid Bionic in a case is a very snug fit, but it fits. I am able to access the screen through the plastic window if I need to. I have a 14-inch bicep so only have to snug it up a little. If your arm is much bigger around than 16 inches, get the extension or look for something else. The armband seems to be of very good quality.",4
"Product fits well on my arm w/o irritation. It served me well for my Droid X, and although a bit on the short side, still stably holds my Galaxy S3 as well.  Solid value.",4
This band work's great. Fit's both my droid x and droid razr max  and my ipod. It keep's in place and my phone protected from sweat.,5
"I bought this for an older Galaxy Ace GT-S5830 phone, however it's worked with several other phones including my blackberry 9850.  Very comfortable and easy to put on.",5
"I am an iPhone 3GS to EVO 4G convert.  I changed to get away from AT&T;'s huge prices and to get a change in scenery on Android.  I previously was using a Tuneband for my iPhone (Tuneband for iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS (not iPhone 4, see description below), Grantwood Technology's Armband, Silicone Skin, and Screen Protector, Blackand LOVED it.  The company only seemed to make this for Apple products so I searched for something similar for my new EVO since I use RunKeeper Pro to track my runs.DESIGN:The Design is pretty straight forward.  It does not exactly fit the EVO, it took a lot of squeezing in there to get it to fit.  Not really a problem.  I was not a fan of the plastic cover on the armband to begin with, but seeing as I was limited in selection, it would have to do.OVERALL:I would take this on medium runs (5-8 miles)for about an hour.  The phone got wet from my sweat and the plastic cover fogged over making reading the screen useless.  I have stopped using the product and am now out the $25 that I spent on it.I would not recommend this to any EVO owner as its more of a 'one size fits all' approach.  Maybe some other phones work better, but the condensation on the inside of an armband with a $500+ phone inside didn't sit well with me at all.I run with the phone in my pocket and am hopeful that someone will come out with a similar design to the Tuneband that is designed for Apple products.",1
I have had this case for over a year and have used it with several phones.  It works great and I have had no issues.  And i've stopped forgetting my phone on the treadmill!,5
"This band works well for my Droid Bionic.  I can use it with the plastic shell on the phone, though a very tight fit.  Or without, stays in fine.  I use it in the gym working out, I get really sweaty and have never noticed it getting to the phone.  I will say if attached too tight, the plastic buckle will rotate during use.  That makes it loose and you may need to re-adjust.  This also happens with the 'extender' piece that you can buy separately.  Not a huge deal, just don't pull it too tight, or if you do like it that way, just turn the buckle before and tighten.  It'll crimp the strap a little, but if you like it tight, you'll need to do this.  The clear plastic in front does reflect light some when trying to view your screen, but just turn it a little and you can see it fine.  I don't know any way around this as you have to have the clear plastic to hold the phone in and be able to see it.  : - )  Overall, I love this product and use it every time I work out!  And with my bluetooth headset, I have no wires flailing around!  Awesome!",5
Bought the igadgitz armband and had to keep taking my case off. I almost bought the tune belt for the otterbox case but thankfully I read the description to come to the slim tune belt. It fits iphone 5s with slim armor perfectly. I'll give the material it's made of 3 1/2 out 5 stars. It's only getting 5 stars because it's really the only armband that I've searched for that I don't have to remove my case so I'm thankful. Plus it isn't as bulky as I originally intended it to be like the igadgitz band which only held the phone and no case (found that to be a big plus).,5
"I'm very happy with my iPhone4, and with its ability to play music through my Motorola S9HD Bluetooth wireless stereo headset. However, the link between the two sometimes fades when the phone is in a belt case, so I've been looking for an arm band case big enough to hold the iPhone4 while in the bumper case Apple is recommending to avoid loss of signal when touching the lower left corner gap in the iPhone's antenna.Tune Belt to the rescue with this new larger model. Though not only for the iPhone4, it does fit the iPhone4 well, without having to first remove the bumper case like other cases I've found that claim to be for the iPhone4. I had no trouble operating the iPhone4 through the Tune Belt case, even though some of the buttons and openings on the iPhone4 are not explicitly supported by the Tune Belt.Construction is good - all a single piece, so nothing will be getting lost. Inserting the iPhone4 in its bumper case takes a bit of strength, due to friction between the bumper case and the Tune Belt neoprene fabric, but that also ensures the phone won't fall out once inserted.The arm band portion is wide and long enough to fit comfortably on most arms, with the phone pointed either up or down as desired. There's an extra little tab under the brand label the looks suited for gripping a key ring, which will be handy.",4
Don't pay attention to the people who say it fits the iPhone while using the Otterbox case. It does not.,3
"As the title says, I bought it for my wife. She has a smart phone that's a bit bulky and odd shaped, and this one fit perfectly. However I borrowed it for my iPhone and it's great too. Unlike many people, I attach it to my forearm so I can use a running application on it so I can stay on track, switch songs as I run - right through the plastic front. It's stretchy and soft so it stays on with out being too tight. Love the ease of taking up extra cord with the side Velcro tab. It's easier to get the phone in than it is to get it out, but I love the feeling of security for my phone and freedom to move about as I run. It still hangs in my wife's closet, but I'll continue to grab it for my runs too!",5
It's kind of cumbersome having this attached to your wrist but it comes in handy when walking or jogging and you want to not have to worry about dropping your phone or butt dialing people.,4
This Tune Belt Sport Armband works just great. If you have large biceps you may want to order the extension. I am able to use through the plastic cover with no problem.  Good product.,5
"Wow, glad I spent a little more on this one.  This is from a reputable company.  The materials are high quality.  The arm band strap is very comfortable.It fit my Droid 4 perfectly, I was nervous at first because this one said made for variety of smart phones.  But the droid 4 fits in perfect and top is covered and all.Haven't tried out the key holder.",5
I found this had a good adjustable range for my arm. Holds my Motorola Droid Bionic great and touch works pretty good still.,5
"I thought that all of the reviews saying the armband was small were probably by people who are ripped and have huge biceps, I figured I'd be safe with my fairly lean arms. I was wrong! It is definitely a tight fit and only gets worse once your blood gets pumping. I feel like they made it small on purpose to force people to buy the extender, but I refuse, I'll just wear the thing on my forearm if I have to. The plastic window can get a bit of condensation on it after a hot, sweaty workout but disappears after you have the armband off for a bit. I'm not too worried about it affecting my phone at all though. The window sits a little bit above the phone's screen so don't plan on using too many touchscreen functions once your workout is in full gear. The little flap to tuck in headphone cords is a nice touch. The built in access holes to plug in headphones don't seem like they would work with any phone at all, but the stretchy material can be manipulated to make it work. I wish it had some sort of reflective material on it, that would be a nice addition for night activities.Pros:Fits my large phone (Samsung Captivate )Reasonably priced.Has a flap to tuck in excess headphone wiresCons:Tiny armbandCondensation forms on plastic window after long work out.Holes don't line up to plug in headphones (but can be made to work)Summary:If you own a larger phone you don't have too many other choices when it comes to an armband, so this one will definitely work just fine and it's relatively inexpensive. Build quality seems pretty good, the seams look solid. But if you have arms bigger than an anorexic 5 year old you may want to consider the armband extender which the same company conveniently happens to sell...hmmmm...",3
"I had a difficult time finding an arm case that would hold my iPhone while it was in its Otterbox case. Problem solved - phone fits perfectly, with room to spare.",5
"Fits my arm well, washable, well made. However my iPhone 3GS does not fit well in it, making it hard to use the button at the bottom of the phone. Also, the clear plastic screen protector makes it very difficult to read the screen in bright sunlight when I'm jogging. Looking to buy something designed specifically for my phone that doesn't have a screen protector now...",2
only fits the evo without the hard case on it.  you can use the screen just fine even when it is in the armband.  pretty comfortable but the plastic doesn't perfectly fit the screen size of the EVO. The reason you probably should not buy this is that the EVO is just too big to comfortably run with for any extended length of time.  Just too big.,3
"I'm training for my fourth marathon and wanted to use my Droid X for music and GPS capabilities.  I have a GPS-enabled watch but wanted to get an armband for my phone for the aforementioned music.The armband arrived quickly and my Droid X fits snugly inside.  The plastic which covers the phone's display area looks to be of cheap construction.I've gone on several long runs with the armband and it stays put and for the most part protects the phone from moisture.  I've used other straps before for other devices and they seemed to slide up and down my arm - but not this one!The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that sometimes it's difficult to work with the phone's screen through the plastic on the armband.  I'm not sure what the best solution to this would be, maybe the plastic needs to be a bit more thick.Also, I've had some condensation build up on the plastic on long runs.  Again, I'm not sure what the solution would be or if my phone is damaged, but it's just something I've noticed.",4
"Although I have only used it once so far it seems like a quality product.  Although, I DEFINITELY have to remove the protective case (Otterbox) from my DROIDX to get it to fit in the arm band.  It is a VERY snug fit.",4
"I had been using this for my Samsung Galaxy SII. It has worked great. I'm crossing my fingers that my new phone will fit, but I'm not expecting it too.",5
"This works well for the Droid X. It is a tight fit, and you will have to take your device out of it's case in order to fit. I use it in the gym without any problems and my phone is well protected. I am changing phones, and will need a bigger one to fit the Galaxy. I will use this manufacturer if they make one for the Galaxy S3.",4
"It works, fits mostly for my droid x, it's strap is a little small for my arm but I'm getting the expandable strap in the mail. It holds the droid x snug and lets me fun with free hands. for that I love it.",4
It was okay the clips broke after a while don't get it if you are one of those that clean their phones a lot,3
"This is the worst case I've ever had. It's extremely flimsy and cheaply made. The front and back covers don't snap together well at all. Please don't even waste your money. It's worth it to invest in a more expensive, better quality case than this piece of junk!",1
"Works, is the last case i have out of the three bought. Haven't tried to remove it yet so we're all good. If i tried to remove it I'm sure it would break.",4
This product lasted me about six months before I dropped my phone and broke this case..It was altogether not a bad purchase but the OtterBox was a better buy for the long lasting durability..I would recommend the OtterBox instead..,3
"great item to help protect the phone from damage if it is dropped, I actually bought 2 because I was not sure of how long this item would last but it has been a while now sincew I put it on the phone and its working  great",4
"When I got this case, it looked good for about a week.After a week of just putting it in your pocket,the rubberized stuff chips off.  Then it looks trashy.It protects but I won't be getting a case like this one.",2
My Captivate loves this case. It fits well and doesn't snag on my pants when trying to get my phone out to answer a call.  I haven't dropped it so I can't tell you how well it will protect but it looks like it will do a good job if I 'woops' up.,4
"I saw the other reviews on this case and thought I'd go with it. I wasn't necessarily disappointed, I mean with shipping the thing was $3. The thing is firm plastic with a decent grip and it doesn't stick in your pocket. The only down side to this case for me is removing it from the phone. It fits tightly and is difficult to remove. I've owned 2 and both have broken the little clips when I've had to take it off. Buy with that in mind, but it's hard to say no to this with the price.",4
"this was a great case that lasted a lot longer than i expected. the color was beautiful and the paint on the case only faded after a long time of use, which is to be expected.",4
"I bought this as well as a couple of the same thing in Black for my Captivate. Although the phone looks great bare, I like a good cover to make it easier to hold onto the phone and protect the phone from the wear and tear in my pockets with keys, change etc.I will say that even though there are naysayers in the reviews of this type of a case I think it looks and holds up great.The black looks really good the red looks great! Very bright color and really helps the phone stand out so it can't be quite so easily misplaced.So I give it a 5 star for looks, a 4 star overall because of the negative and my ONLY negative with this case, and it is probably an important consideration for many, is that you must be very careful in taking the case off since it is a 2 piece case with very thin plastic along the face piece (in any color in this style) and as I know by doing it, the face of the case can be EASILY broken. For me it snapped along the thin side across from the main case opening area.So if you're one of those who need to change the battery for extra life while away from a charger or need to change out the Micro SD card, I would say you should probably stay away from this or any kind of secured two piece cover and stick with a one piece silicon type. I have all the home and car chargers and am in an office all day so charging isn't an issue and I don't need to take the case on and off usually.As I said though I bought 2 black ones and a red one too. For the great Amazon price it was worth it. Especially since where I live there are no places to buy any cover for the phone except the area AT&T; store which means $$$$$$$!",4
i really love this product. it gives my phone a really good appearance and feel. it deifinitely stands out from the crowd.,4
"I bought this case for my husband because our 2 yr old kept taking off the soft case he had on his phone and ripped it. This case protects the phone better and our daughter cant take it off. Its good quality for a very good price and the free shipping was a pleasant surprise.On an updated note, the case started peeling after a few weeks, bummer.",5
"The phone has been dropped many times and there are some scuff marks, but it hasn't cracked or anything. It is a very glossy coating, so don't think this will make the phone any easier to hold.",4
Slim and stylish and my favorite color! very good for when you just want to stick you phone in your back pocket (even though you are not supposed to) it did a pretty fair amount of protecting from small falls but probably wouldn't hold up to a major drop.,5
I love this case. It's so pretty and slim. Definitely worth the money. Fits my iPhone 4s so well! Definitely recommend,5
"This case was difficult to put on and take off because it was so tight! It was a little too snug for my comfort. Also, it's shiny and slippery. Not much of a grip...",3
"At first I got a CaseCrown Slash (black) CaseCrown Slash Glider Case (AT&T, Sprint, & Verizon compatible) Screen Protector included - Blackcase - two of them actually. One for my new iPhone 4S and the other one for my son's 4S. He is away at school so I was not concerned about confusing my phone with his. However the first time he came to visit it did turn out to be a problem. So I decided to get myself a case of a different color. I liked the black Slash - it felt snug and non-slippery in my hand and it provided like 1/32 of an inch protection edge for the screen (as when you put the phone down with the screen down the glass will not actually touch the surface of the table). They did not not have a SLASH case in a color acceptable to me, so I went with this silver one. It is also a nice case. Also easy to put on and also provides protection for the screen - not as much though - may me 1/64 vs. 1/32 in the Slash model. However the case is not non-slippery - it is really smooth - not unlike the iPhone 4S without the case. I don't think it is going to be a huge problem, but it is not as easy to securely handle the phone while taking it out of the front pocket of my jeans. The way it feels in my hands is different. Very smooth. But not as secure. But I guess as far as how it feels against my palm -- I like the smooth feel better.",5
"This is the second Casecrown iphone case that I have purchased. It's obvious they make quality cases and are built to last after your phone takes many plunges. I love both of mine (I also have one in blue). I do prefer the rubberized over the metallic because it has more of a grip. However, both are great cases and highly recommend casecrown to anyone looking for a phone case. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.",5
"This is our second glider case.  My wife has had one on her iPhone 4 for a long time.  I just got an iPhone 4S so I got this one for me.  As expected, the case works well.  It hugs the phone nicely.  The bottom comes off fairly easily.  As with the first case, over time, it became more and more loose and I expect this one will do the same.  But it hasn't been a big problem.I primarily need this case so that I can keep the phone protected (from scratches; obviously, this will not do well against falls) but be able to quickly plug it into a docking keyboard (Apple original).  For this, it works quite well.But I'm only giving this one a 4 out of 5 because the picture makes the case look more metallic than it actually is.  I think a more accurate description would be 'glossy grey'.  The case looks okay and I've gotten compliments on it.  Just not what I expected.  And the second reason is that the holes in the case to allow access to the ports only work kind of okay.  Some headphone cables are able to pass through okay, some don't.  Some charger cables pass through okay, some don't.  This is not a big deal around the house but annoying when I'm out (connecting it to the car, etc).  I'll likely use this case in the house and get something else for 'out'.",3
"The title says it all.  this phone is so slippery it will slide out of your hand at a 15 degree angle.  Looks cool, but that isn't enough for this guy.",3
"Silver is a nice compliment to anything, phone's included. If you use this case, you will definitely be styling walking down the street or on the subway.",5
"I've ordered multiples of these, and they all fit my 4S perfectly. This green one is my favorite- it's bright and metallic-y. Looks great on my white iPhone. Definitely protects from falls- I think I drop my phone more than anyone I know (not something I'm proud of). The case gets scratched up after a few months/multiple falls on cement, but my phone has survived every fall without a scratch (when paired with a screen protector of course). But I'd rather pay $10 for a new case instead of $100+ for a new phone.",4
"I've purchased a CaseCrown case for my iPhone 3GS, and it worked perfectly. So when I upgraded, I wanted to stick with the same case brand that saved my iPhone numerous times in the past. Unfortunately, when I got it and tried to slide my phone into it, it wouldn't fit. I stupidly thought that maybe the fit was suppose to be super tight so I tried squeezing my phone into the top piece of the case. I was almost able to get it to slide all the way in, but I was left with a small gap at the top. When I tried to get my phone out, it was stuck. I wasn't able to pull my phone out of the top half of the case for quite sometime. It did end up scratching my phone a little bit, but that was obviously my fault.There are some good reviews on here, so maybe mine was just defective..",1
"This case is just the color I was looking for.  It's a shiny hot pink and very pretty.  I wish it wrapped a little more around the front of the phone, like the CaseCrown Chameleon and the InCase slider cases that I have since those seem to offer a little more protection, but I'll use this one for awhile.",4
"I like the case. it protects the phone well and the color is nice. online it looks more like a baby/robins egg blue. in reality it is a light aqua. still nice, but darker than it looks online.",4
"Case is very nice. Snaps solid into place, protects the phone. Allows use of docking stations, such as an alarm clock or stereo with out having to remove the case.",5
I've had this case since the beginning of the year when I got my iPhone4 and ill just say my phone would be beat up without this.  I have a deep and long scratch on my case and I have no clue how it got there.Pros:-has a liner on the inside so it doesn't scratch the back of the phone when you put it on-there's a hole for a phone charm-feels hard and sturdyCons:-kind of slippery and sleekOverall this is an excellent case! I've dropped my phone plenty of times when I get out of the car and I'm amazed its still functioning perfectly fine.,5
"I was extremely scared of buying this case, because since I have had my Verizon iPhone 4S since February, every case I bought does not fit. I make sure they say they are for the 4S too. When I first put it on I thought it did not fit. But once I played with it a little it actually fit really tightly around the phone. I had to push the phone down into the case so the green lip stuck over the glass. I have had it about 2 hours so I am not sure how I like it yet. The color is a perfect match to the picture. The reason I rated it four stars is because it is nearly impossible to get off, which could end up being a plus if I drop the phone and the case doesn't break off.For those who have the 4S and are worried about this case fitting, just play with it a bit. It will work.",4
My wife had an old case similar to this that was all busted up and refused to get a new one. I picked this up as a stocking stuffer and she was ecstatic. This fit her iPhone 4 great with no issues,5
I can't believe I almost returned this case without giving it a second chance.The case is good much better than the one I got from Best Buy and its price is much cheaper.The bottom part can be removed whenever docking the phone.,4
Great looksExcellent fitSlim profileMight be slippery to someGreat buy for iPhone4s. Lightweight too. Go for it.,4
"I love this case, the color is really nice with the white iphone. It fits snug but is not hard to slide off the iphone 4s when you need to take it off. I dont think it affects the camera like other people have said. I am very satisfied with it. No complaints.",5
I bought this case for my iPhone 4 it was a tight fit. If you need a case that you can easily remove to place on your dock this may not be the case for you. I loved the color but the case itself snapped and broke on the second day when I went to remove it. I bought this case for an AT&T iPhone 4. I would not recommend this case.,1
"This is a terrific case. The fit is superb and secure, and screen protectors are not affected. The padded inside protects against scratches. The camera/LED aperture is generous. It accepts a standard charger just fine, and the bottom slides off for docking (it *can* be a bit tight to get off if you don't have fingernails to grab it with). It's very shiny and slick, which you may or may not like since it collects fingerprints easily and will tend to slide easily down any incline (think: car seat). The outside is hard plastic, rather than anything rubberized.I've been using mine for about 4 months now. My phone has fallen out of my breast pocket several times now onto a hard concrete floor--once when I absent-mindedly missed the pocket (doh, I'll never do *that* again); the other time when I was bending over to reach for something on the ground. Each time I had a small heart attack, but the phone bounced lightly in the case, and both the phone and the case were no worse for the wear and scare.I have a friend with one of the InCase models, and my impressions is that the CaseCrown is just superior, and a fraction of the cost.",5
"I've had and tried several cases, first I had the Apple Bumper (blue and green) but after a few months of use they would start to discolor and look dirty. I tried a few others, either the fit was off, or they were bulky, got dirty too quickly, didn't fit well. This case fits like a glove, isn't distracting (around the screen) and so far protects well (haven't dropped it so I can't say anything regarding that). It looks like it would be slippery but I find that not to be the case. The color is great (blue) and looks just as pictured. All access to the buttons is great. I LOVE this case!",5
The color is great!  The two pieces fit together tight and the inside of the case is lined with a velvety material.  It's perfect!  And the price is good too.,5
I searched online and in stores for a cover for my new iphone.  I'm so happy I decided on this one!!! The color is even better in person. It is a metallic hot pink and very durable.  It was easy to put on.  The only drawback is that when taking pictures with a flash the cover causes the picture to be a little blurry. I think this happens with most cases- not a huge deal.,5
this case was 'ok' the fit is a pain and it does not stay snapped together very well. I have never used it even because of this,2
"I purchased a red one awhile back that was perfect, had a good non slip grip, no matter how many times I dropped it I never had any problems. I ordered this thinking it would be around the same. Quality is still there, but its pretty slipery. Just be careful when you hold your phone with this case, especially with wet hands, it tends to slip out.",4
"Snug fit on Iphone 4S (Sprint) Ordered the Black Obsidian Polycarbonate case (love it) and then decided on this Metallic case assuming it would be aluminum, its not. I prefer the obsidian rubber texture vs this case's plastic/ cheap feel.Overall the case offers adequate abrasion protection.  Case does not overlap over screen, this is great for phones with screen protectors.",4
"My wife loves these cases for her iphone, as do I; great quality.  I have purchased her multiple colors and styles, (girls) and shes's happy with them all.",5
the color was just what I wanted and it has held up really well.  seem to be a strong case and doesn't scratch too easy.,5
"The color of this phone matched pretty well what I thought it would look like. I really like that it has the velvet inside so it doesn't scratch your phone as I have a white iphone and you would be able to see scratches easily. I was worried that the cover didn't have high enough edges to protect the front of the phone if it was dropped, however I have dropped my phone in the case a few times now and it does! (I do have a protecive film on the screen which is helping as well). Where I have dropped the case a little bit of the paint is chipping off, but that is to be expected as they were pretty rough falls. I do like this phone. My only problem is that I would like to see the edges be a little bit higher but other than that it's a decent cover and I would buy another.",4
"This was my first case, and for the price you can't go wrong. It is a hard glossy plastic, but it is NOT as slipper as everyone mentioned. It's two pieces which take some effort to slide in perfectly, but I had no issues lining them up.This is a thin case that offered a lot of protection. After about 7 months of usage, I've dropped it one to many times where I needed to get a new one. But I am very pleased with how well it worked.",5
It is flimsy and has no lip to protect the screen.  I'll stick with my Incipio slider which is very sturdy.,1
"The case looks great which is the only positive I have for it.  The top edge of the plastic is in line with the top of the iPhone, maybe .25mm above it.  If the phone was dropped on it's edge it would probably protect it but not like the cases that come up and over the edge.  Also, the case is in two pieces which would be fine if they fit together well.  The pieces were tightly closed on the back of the phone but open about .5 - 1.5mm on the sides of the phone.  It does not make for a good look.  I'm sending it back after having received the Incipio NGP Case in matte black today and it is fabulous.  I can't recommend that one highly enough.",2
"It's a great case. the only thing is that it is a very tight fit and doesnt come on or off so easily, so you have to acutally wear latex gloves to give you that traction to take it off.  For the price point, it's a steal!",3
"I bought the silver case and am disappointed because I expected the case to have a metallic look. It looks like grey plastic to me, but I can deal with that. My biggest problem with this case is that the front of the case is nearly flush with my screen. The whole reason I bought the case is to protect my phone if I drop it. With this case on, if my iPhone 4s falls face first, the screen will be scratched or damaged.Other than the disappointment over the subtlety of the metallic look and the fact that the case doesn't protect the most important part of my phone, it does fit nicely and looks well made.",3
"So I am new to the iPhone and I wanted to make sure that i got something that would protect it, look good, and not get stuck in my pocket. Well 'ding ding ding' we have a winner this is a great case. My roommate ended up liking it so much he got one too!",5
"I used this one with my iPhone 4 and it did its job protecting my device from scratches, it lasted for about 4 month then I cracked on the bottom. Anyway good product.",5
"Im not sure how much protection it will provide if dropped hard or from a significant distance, but it should do the job.  It fits snuggly and doesn't encumber your use of the phone that much.  A little more effort needed to adjust volume or ringer/vibrate switch.  This case will not provide any protection for the front of your phone...recommend getting an invisible shield by Zagg.UPDATE:  the plastic is very cheap and cracked after one week.  you get what you pay for.  don't buy, not durable",1
"Had used it for more than 2 years. Had to buy at least 2-3 over the period but my usage was so rough, can't really blame the product itself. It did its job really well of protecting my iPhone 4 for 2.5 years. Dropped it several times and saved always. Now my father uses it and he never feels as though its a 2.5 year old phone so thanks to this case for keeping my iPhone scratch free. !Took off one star as dust gets through the cases and I used to clean it once in two months! Other than it, it's been a good product with good fit and kept the slim look alive!!",4
Bought this one for my iphone. Kind of ok product.Don't know why I bought this one... I don't use it much.,3
Not much is better than OtterBox. Fun color selection. It pays to protect your iPhone. The only problem I have with these is that one cannot add camera lenses and such with the cover on the phone.,5
"If you have an IPhone 4, this product is excellent for protection.  Easy to use, lookes great!  Excellent product from Otterbox.",5
"I did emailed u when I got my order of Otterbox Case for iPhone 4g REd/black but front was spot wont remove I like to have other one no pay I will return other but I perfer get replace first because I easily drop iphone I dont want break or crack.thanks,emiestringer",5
'Great'. This item came when it was supposed to. It came in great condition. It was exactly as was advertised. Wonderful.,5
this is a lot better than paying $50 for the same case! got it pretty quick as well. i would recommend this product to anybody or any like it.,4
It protects and extends the life of your iphone ten fold by simply protecting it from drops and other life accidents.,5
"It is more orange than red, this is for the older version 4. The rubber tabs are a pain. Was easy to hold though. Big hands will like the size.",2
Just like mine :) (except mine is pink and white) my husbands colors are red and black and this was perfect.,5
I got this case for me. The red is great. The case protects my phone wonderful. The case arrived promptly. Good buy for the price.,5
Another case for my phone.  Good deal and value for the money.  Will be back when I get the Iphone 5,5
"I found this item to be as it claimed, however it seems a bit weak from the Otterbox I had for my IPhone 3Gs. It seems to work however I have not had it where I have dropped the phone or been exposed to weather. I will continue to use this until it proves not to work.",3
greatest thing for ur iphone but after u figuere out that its not as fragile as u think ull boot it just lk i did. this case is just way to bulky to carry it around in ur pocket.,5
"It looks and feels great! not bad for the price, it came in original box- colors are amazing! would def buy again in diffrent colors.",5
"this case is three cases in one! not only will it protect from falls it is slightly water proof. it has a built in sceen protecter that doesnt scrach easy. it has a rubber outer shell for easy hold and shock absobtion. I dont worry about my 6 moth old playing with my phone in this case!!!I love the protection you get from the otter box cases! I have three of them in different colors. I dont mind that they are bulky it just means more protection, though a lot of poeple may not want the bulk. You can try other otter box cases as well. I have tried a few but i will always like the defender case the best!",5
I bought this case not to long ago and have been having difficulties with it. The flap that covers the volume doesn't go all the way down because of the actual plastic part of the case doesn't line up. The other problem I am having is the oil slick effect. I found out that OtterBoxes for the iPhone 4 no longer do that due to new technology with the case.I am starting to think that  the actual plastic part of the case i received is a knock off with a real OtterBox silicone case to cover it. So at this price I guess just beware.,3
"I am pleased with this case, it is exactly what I expected it to be.If your #1 concern is protection, this is your case.  It will protect against just about any accident involving dropping, throwing, etc., your phone.  I am an engineer by trade, and the boss wanted an 'engineer-proof' phone.  Check.However, the superiorly protective case doesn't come without a negative side-effect or two, which are necessary by design, in my opinion.This case makes the phone several times thicker, and the thickness of your phone will likely be the first thing people notice about it.  The bulk is due to the plastic cover, which -- of course -- provides the protection, so it is essential.Also, the encased phone will not fit in to most docking stations.  This will prove to be a hassle to iPhone users with a collection of iPod/iPhone docks, as they will have to remove the case (which can be a hassle) before using a dock.But from a design standpoint, it is not worth making the iPhone dock-friendly at the expense of making the bottom of the phone vulnerable.But again: if you want protection, protection, protection, this is your case.P.S.: If that docking limitation bothers you, I'd recommend looking upOtterBox Reflex-Series Case for iPhone 4 (Black).",5
"I recently joined (slightly behind the wave) into the group of iPhone owners.  I ordered the Otterbox Defender Case because I was told there is no better case for protecting the iPhone 4.I am very impressed with the quality of this product.  Installing it on my iPhone was a little confusing at first, but I learned that was because I was reluctant to stretch the rubber-like material to remove it and re-install it on my phone.But once it was completed the fit was perfect and the belt carrier portion holds the iPhone very securely.  FYI the price was much better online through Amazon.com than if purchased locally, about $17.00 less.I am very happy with this product and am interested to see how it wears over time.",5
If you don't mind the bulkiness this offers excellent protection. It's a shell within a shell. Even the screen is protected.,5
"I would like to start off by letting you know that I started using the Otterbox case for iPhone back in 2007 when I bought the 1st generation iPhone. Back then, Otterbox had an Armored case for iPhone that was waterpproof! Ok getting back on track, Otterbox have set the standard for case that actually protect the device even if you were lets say abusive to your gadget. That has been the case and the standard I've come to expect from Otterbox. I had no complaints with all the previous cases up until they introduced the Defender Caser for iPhone 4. I was suprised as to the workmanship/design of the new case. iPhone 4 case itself is thinner than the ones from the previous models and the clasp/snaps that hold the two pieces of the case together doesn't snap tight like their previous cases and to top it off the iPhone 4 case doesn't have the membrane on the speaker port that prevent dust & things from getting into the case.With that said, the iPhone 4 Defender case does provide sufficient protection against drops and incidental dings, but it falls short of the quality of the product I have come to expect from Otterbox.One thing I must say is that Otterbox stands by their product and provide support whether it involves replacing the broken plastic or torn silicon cover. One thing is for sure, there isn't a case out there can protect the iPhone like Otterbox Defender Case and a company that stand by their product like Otterbox!In conclusion, yes this is a must have case to protect your valuable investment!",5
"First of all I'd like to say that if you have the iphone 4 in WHITE, you will be dissapointed to know that the otterbox defender cases are not compatible with it because there is a variation between the black and white iphones where the proximity sensor is concerned.  You can use the case just fine, however when you are on a call the camara sensor that makes the screen black while you are talking will NOT work with this case, instead it blocks the sensor and so the phone will stay lit while making a call.  I was irritated immediately when I found this out.  I did go onto the otterbox website to find that indeed the white iphone isnt compatible with this case, no help to me at all.  So I went onto youtube and found out that all that has to be done is remove the clear plastic film that covers the sensor on the front of the phone.  It is very easy to remove with just your fingernail after taking the case off of your iphone.  Then just replace put the case back on the phone and it works exactly like it should when on a call.  It also doesnt change the protectiveness of the case at all as the hole is recessed down pretty deep so you would actually have to have a pen or something jab your phone to do damage in precisely that location.  Not too likely.Onto the case, I liked the 3gs defender series from otterbox but just hated the lack of any decent colors.  With the 4g design there are plenty of otterbox's in a variety of rainbow colors to choose from.  I personally went with the hot magenta pink and white myself and love it.  The outside stays pretty lint free and for the most part the rubber piece stays put.  There are no longer any worries of water-like marks on the screen.  Otterbox fixed the protective plastic.  There are times when the rubber comes off a bit, but you can easily push on it and it locks back into the hard plastic shell of the case.  All ports are covered just like with the old 3gs style and it just looks really nice on the phone.  I just bought mine along with my new iphone in white earlier this week.  We shall see how it stands up to the test of time.  I am hoping it will hold up as well as the Otterbox 3gs defender series case.  So far I am loving it now that I adapted it to work perfectly with my iphone!",4
"This case is very nice in its protection of the iphone 4.  Where it falls down is two fold.  First, it is very bulky.  The thickness of the iphone is doubled by the case.  The second problem is that without taking off the case, you are unable to put this thing in a cradle to charge it.  It will only charge with the cable plugged into it.Overall, I really like this case.  I dont even mind the size but many people might. If I could just set this into my ihome without taking off the case it would be perfect.",4
"This is by far the best cover anyone could want for their Iphone 4.Well made, securely fits on the phone, total access to all buttons as well as having a permanent and touch sensitive protection screen. Everything I could ever want to protect my phone except for one glaring problem.  I am totally unable to plug my Iphone into either of my docking/speaker stations.  Two different manufacturers - no accessibility.The problem is exactly the reason why this cover is so good. Because it has multiple layers of protection, it is bulkier rather than slimmer.  So therefore you cannot just slip it into a station and have it work.  Unless I want to keep taking the cover off everytime I want to play my music throughout my home (which I do not believe is an adviseable solution), than I had no choice but to return this cover and buy something else a little sleeker.Oh and one more small but subjective issue. If you have small hands like I do, it can be a little awkward holding the covered Iphone in your hand.  Not a deal breaker by any means, but just something to be aware of.Really loved this cover, just sorry it would not work for me.",3
Perfect for my new I-phone 4 - very sturdy and the screen cover is perfect for my job where it gets bumped around some.  The price at Amazon was half of other web sites.,5
"This is a great case, if you are looking for a case to protect you IPhone you should buy this.  My husband loves his new case, it covers the phone, the price was great, I had search for the OtterBox defender case and the price was to Much, but this was a great buy well worth the money and he wants another just to have a back up lol loves case.",5
"I think I bought this case from Best Buy back in September. I know that sound silly ..... either I bought this case or not but they are so many different OtterBox Defender cases listed for the iPhone-4 now that weren't listed when I bought mine. When I bought mine from Best Buy there were only Black, Red and this Blue available and they were all $49.95.I started out with only a Zagg protector on my iPhone-4 from the time it came out of the box and it worked well until I put a horrible RocketFish silicone skin case on it from Best Buy. The RF case kept gapping on the sides and the bottom kept peeling up the Zagg protector and trapping dirt and lint underneath till it was no longer useable. I ended up returning the RF case and putting the money toward this case.I could have ordered the Black case from Amazon in September when I purchased this unit at Best Buy for $20 less but the truth is that the BB people were great in accepting the return of the RF case and they even let me put my phone in a demo model of this case to try it before I made the purchase. Well worth the extra money paid to buy the case 'in person' so to speak.Installation of this case was relatively easy and I opted not to put the Zagg screen protector under the cases built in screen protector.I have dropped the fun a few times including once throwing the phone in an asphalt parking lot accidentally during one of my 'passionate' conversations. The phone is very well protected and gets minimal bulk from the case. The only draw back is that it won't work with any docking stations inside the case. I put a Dock Extender on my Christmas list so hopefully I can stop using a cable to charge and get back to my Altec Lansing speaker dock thereafter.",5
Case works great. I accidentally dropped my iPhone after having the case for a day and the iPhone was not damaged by landing on my desk at work. Without the case the screen could have cracked!My only complaint was the plastic covering that goes over the proximity sensor was already scratched when i open the packaging. Maybe i got one that was returned?,4
"This is a decent product for the price.  They advertise it as the ultimate protection, and it sure looks like it; I won't be afraid to drop it.  I purchased this because of a new job that will require me to work on raised structures, and a friend recommended it.Pros: Built-in screen protector, port covers for headphone jack/mute switch and dock connector.  Solid build quality.Cons: Considerable weight and bulk.  Silicon grip is very slippery in the hand.  Home button looks off-center, but does work.  Very difficult to disassemble for a night on the town.Summary: I probably would not purchase this again.  I'm fairly satisfied with this product, though I should have reviewed more products before purchasing.",4
This is probably the best and safest case anyone can buy for their iPhone 4.  The only thing that I'd like to have differently is the color.  It would have been nicer to have a wider range of colors to choose from.,4
I bought this to protect a old iPhone 3G that we don't use as a phone any more. The grand kids use it only for games and wifi Internet. They drop this phone quite a bit and this case has saved it. OK case for the price bit you have to install all the clear screen protectors yourself.,4
Very happy with this cover.  Not being waterproof is not that much of a concern for me.  Not having the cover over the screen means you don't have to press as hard on the icons.,5
I needed a phone cover that would not slip out of my hands.  This one is perfect - the cover protects it & jazzes it up as well.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone.  My phone takes a good bit of abuse because my grandchildren always want to play with it.,5
I really enjoyed my case because it protected my phone very good and that is something I need. The shipping took a little long but it got here and served me well.,5
This is a total knockoff of an OtterBox Defender case and it is not anywhere near as good as an OtterBox.,2
Great colors and it does the job of keeping the phone safe. My little girl uses an old iphone of ours for her games and she loves this case.,5
"These are not new. The batteries are worn and the contact show signs of long term use. Not happy, but what could I expect for the price...The ad explicitly states - NEW.UPDATE: I raised my rating from a 1 star to a 2 star. They are obviously used when stated new, but they do hold a charge well. No saying how old they are, but at least they work.",2
got here quick. works. i thought it died cuz it died and then wouldnt come back on but it did after charging and works fine again,5
"I was a little surprised when I received this to find that it really is an OEM battery, identical to the one that came with the phone.The only difference is that it out-performs the battery that originally came with it (almost twice the life of the original).Instant shipping and almost ridiculously cheap.Simply a perfect on-line shopping experience.",5
I bought this product for my gilfriends phone.Charged it up and worked like it supposed to. Her old battery wasnt keeping a charge and I saw Amazon had the battery at a very good price,4
"I'm not sure what is wrong with these batteries, since they are original Samsung brand merchandise.  When half of the reviewers have bad experiences with them, obviously something isn't right.I bought this battery to replace a dying cell phone battery in my son's phone.  I charged it overnight, but it only worked a few minutes.  If he turned the phone off and then back on, it would work again for a few minutes then die.I contacted the vendor, who sent me a replacement battery free of charge (a tip of the hat and 5-star seller rating given to HollyCellular).  The second one seems to hold a charge better than the first one, but I don't have high hopes for it.",3
Arrived on time. Shipped with over 50% charge. Old battery would not hold charge. Was told replacement would be well over $50.00 dollars at store. Working great and would buy again from this vendor....,5
None wanted to stick to my phone,1
awesome,5
"Love life just the way it is, take it and enjoy the waves while it last. you never know when the next good wave will come by, so take it just like it the last wave on earth",5
"Well I am completely dissatisfied by this purchase. The screens I received did not matched the ones showed on the web page. They DID NOT cover the whole screen as shown on picture. I called and I did not got what I wanted. They offer a refund but I will not bother, not worth the time and money. They arrived fast thoug.",1
"Very good screen protector, no finger print on the screen.. pretty cool..thanks for a good product..I will keep on looking for more good stuff from here",2
what do business again in the future I'm really happy thank you so much once again thank you so much,5
"easy to apply fit perfectly on the phone, easy to install, come with more than one just incase you mess up",5
The display image here is not correct. The screen protector does not cover my whole front view of my phone. I expected it to cover my phone buttons but it did not.,2
I loved these protectors. It sure saves your screen from getting all scratched and dirty. Easy to remove and replace,5
FIRST AT ALL THIS PRODUCT IS VERY DIFICULT TO INSTALL ON THE SCREEN WITHOUT GETTING THE BUBBLES AND ALSO THE SELLER PROMISE TO SEND 5 UNITS AND ONLY SEND 3.DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY.,1
"I purchased two packages of these screen protectors. Shipping was free which was a plus. However the products I received were not what was advertised. The screen protectors do fit the phone, but there is no cut out at the bottom for the menu, back, buttons etc. This can obviously cause issues with functionality.",1
"This is a good find. Easy to put on, just kind of hard to get the bubbles out near the speaker thing at the top. I like it over over all!",5
Not what I read it was..There were 2 different phones mentioned apparently because I received incorrect one then told that was what I ordered. It was not.,1
"The picture clearly shows that it is for the T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S2, but when it arrived, it was not for my phone. I contact the seller, but they were no help, although it only cost $2.00, imagine how many people they did this to and did not return the item (such as I didnt)'Update: The seller still sent me the wrong item, as it these cases still cover the camera, but they stated it does work although the front camera is covered, but they have refunded my purchase price as well as sent me another pack that fits my phone more, i would like to thank their customer service team for doing such a great job",3
"Come off VERY easily. I also really, really, really, really, really wish that these screen protectors would stop being advertised as having a retail package. These are mailed with no indication as to which model phone they are meant to be used upon at all. And then when you put these on should you accidentally touch the adhesive with you fingertip that spot becomes instantly useless for adhering to the surface of the phone. Even if you get this thing on perfect with all of the perfect conditions - clean hands that have the correct amount of moisture in them, a clean room with that perfect humidity and temperature, the phone operating at that perfect temperature, and of course the stars being in alignment. Only then will this get on without a flaw, but then a week or two later for on reason whatsoever, the thing falls of or miraculously has dirt underneath it?!?*",2
work very well I'm happy with it I don't really have much to say about this item but it protect my phone,5
"Nothing really special, it's a piece of plastic to protect your screen. It applied easily and held up well. I misplaced them long before I used more than 2.",3
"It was okay, yes there are 5 but these are hard to apply. You aren't supposed to use water and unlike the invisible shields the bubbles don't go away. It's good for no finger prints and glares. Probably would not get another.",3
I liked the price a lot for the screen protectors and the amount I received. These were a good investment and protected my phone from scratches.,4
I love the fact that I got 5 for this price. Sometimes protectors don't stay on but this 1 does.,5
"I got these film protectors for my phone & I have to say that they work great!! I would recommeng buying them, Plus you get can count on them to protect your phone from scratches! Great product!",5
"They do work, but definitely don't last long.  You get what you pay for, and that's the truth.  I do enjoy getting 5 packs though for that very reason.",4
This screen is advertised as an exact fit. No matter how I placed it this cover was about a mm to long I had to trim it. Made it very aggravating.,2
"Fits much better than the one that came with my Otterbox. Almost seamless. The only thing is they are anti-glare, and after looking at my shiny AMOLED screen it will take getting used to. All around unbelievable deal.  No better price on earth. Thanks!",4
these were a good buy and came in handy for my parents to use to protect there screens recommened to anyone,5
Really liked this purchase.  The cover is thicker and stays on the phone much better then the generic ones.  I have had the same cover on my phone for almost 18 months! I am very happy with this purchase and will buy again.,5
Easy to apply and last longer than some of the other I have used in the past. The price was great too!,5
"I bought another set of screen protectors with about the same price, but those are far inferior: with evident fringes, easy to be scratched. These ones are so much better, under same conditions, I only got very few scratches so far after several months of usage. I never tried anything more expensive, but as far as I can tell, these protectors at lease make me satisfied.",5
I would not justify this product to even have a star.  First it would not sit properly on the face. Then when I tried to clean it with the cloth it came with it put swirl marks on the protective screen.  So even though I got it on it still looked like crap because it was already all scratched.  I would not recommend this product to my dog to chew on.  I had to go and pay $15.99 for a proper screen protector.,1
Comes in a 5 pack and very cheap.  Works great and has protected my screen as well as the $20 ones and I can change it out every few months when it gets dirty and scratched without costing too much or to big of a pain.  Get this instead of the $20 ones in the mall.,5
Well I liked this a lot but the bubbles did not come out all the way and my phone broke,3
"The covers are the perfect size, but I never could figure out how to get them to stick onto the faceplate of the phone. Two sticky tabs at the top? One faces out, and the other faces in. I watched the online video and it did not exactly jive with what I had. I ended up purchasing another product locally.",2
Yes I would definitely recommend you buy this product as I have had experience putting the covers on and what I have learned is that you may want a couple to practice with. This shipper includes extra covers just for this reason.. And yes they fit exactly as advertised.,5
This is a great screen protector and comes in a useful amount that I am sure would last the lifetime of the phone. Had some minor problems applying it to the screen the first time around (small bubbles) but resolved it using a sturdy piece of plastic to put it into place.,5
"As the material states, 'no cutting is required!'I bought what I hope will be several months worth in 3 sets of the 5-per set. At a great price and very easy to install, just make sure you're in as dust proof an area as you can be when putting these or any screen covers on!These do go on very easily and look and fit great! I've had the ones before that were 'close' to the right size and you need to trim a bit off to get the right fit a little more right, but all I've used so far and in all the sets I have they look pre-cut perfectly!So, if your one of the multitudes of Samsung Captivate owners like me I highly recommend these screen covers if you use screen covers!",5
This protector was perfect. Fits just right and was very easy to install. Keeps the smudges under control and looks good.,5
"I bought several of these and it's a good thing I didn't spend too much money. As advertised, the fit is excellent. No trimming  needed. I actually had to go through about 4 of them before I actually got one on the phone where I could get all the bubbles out and not trap any cat hair or dust particles underneith. Once I get that situated I thought they were pretty nice. The issue is, the phone touch screen itself is already designed to be used without a screen protector and to with stand fingerprints. So, with that said, these protectors do what they advertise very well BUT....I gave them a three because for one, they don't include a squeegee to help get the bubbles out. You are at your own wits as to how to work with the trapped bubbles. For another, if you have a phone like I do that uses the swype feature on the virtual keyboard, then after rubbing your finger across the surface of this a few times while swyping, minute scratches begin to appear and after a time of use...any where the finger is pressed on the touch screen in the same place over and over again, the screen protector becomes scratched and smudged looking. So my take on these is, why have or use a screen protector on your phone if it will eventually make the screen hard to see after prolonged use and you have to have extras to keep switching them out? I did purchase extras for that reason but, I just might go back to using the phone screen and not worry about scratches as it is designed to protect against them. I think these would be alright if you were using a phone that wasn't so much a touch screen or a capacitive touch screen. I also wanted to mention that these also take away from the sesitivety of the capacitive touch screen. Screens are much harder to slide and the swype function does not respond as well. I have a major issue with the home buttons taking a much harder press to activate also. Therefor I don't feel these and products like them are not as desireable as they should be for such phones like mine. Now I have the dilemma of weather to peal it off because the one I have on has such a good fit and absolutely no bubbles this time, or just leave it on until I get real annoyed that I can't see the screen as well any more.UPDATE: I peeled it off a few days ago. The phone looks so much nicer without it on there. You can see the scratched and smudged area on the protector where I slid my fingers and where I pressed alot. I have decided, since my the screen on my Thrive was temporarily ruined from the use of a screen protector, that I am going to do away with the use of ANY screen protector for now until I find that screen scratching or dropping the units or fingerprints that won't clean off becomes an issue for me.",3
"This protector is good, it was so easy to put on and it's doing the job that was posted. The protector allows the phone screen to be fingerprint free.",5
"No issues with these just do what the instructions say and there it is. Had no real issues putting on the protector. You must make sure there is no dust on the screen. Where can you find a place where there is no dust, mmmmm?",5
"This is a useful product. It came faster than I thought, and it works very well! I recommend this product to everyone that wants to keep your Samsung safe.",5
These are good products. They really help keep your screen from getting scratched. The amount of Guards you get for the price is a good deal.,5
"its okay but always having to wipe it because it gets smudges and doesnt always wipes clean easy,bit it has help in keeping screen protected",3
"this didn't work for me, or I used it wrong. I found some kind of application tape that was stuck to the film that I couldn't get off. I have purchased screen protectors before and never had this issue, yet all the ones I have purchased in the past few months have the tape stuck to them. I now just use my phones without the screen protectors.",1
"this product arrived in a short time from ordering and fit my phone exactly. They were easy to apply and no air bubbles. I havent had to use more than one yet, but I totally love them.",5
"These screen protectors are inexpensive, but difficult to install. They are precisely cut so there is very little room for error when trying to center them. The smallest speck of dust will leave a visible scrach when wiped off. There are other inexpensive screen protectors out there that are much better at resisting scratches (3x).",2
it was great but by the time I got this I got an upgrade on phone plan so don't need them now but will keep the incase I need to use the old phone.,4
"Screen protector woks just great, am still on the first one, which has been on since original purchase date and delivery.  Would recommend to anyone who was looking for Samsung Captivate Galaxy S phone these work great.  Touch pen goes right to it every text or email that I send.",5
"the item arrived on time. Putting it on is very easy. However you will feel resistance when your finger swip through the screen protector.  In a word you will feel someting there with resistance.  It won't be fluid action.  My old screen proctector was excellent, I couldn't even feel anything on the screen in terms of resistance, very smooth, very fluid.  Given the price, this is a ok product.",3
"Replaced my wife's old protector with one of these, and her phone looks brand new again!  Provides great protection, easy to apply, and all is clear again!",5
"It is very hard to put on because it is exact fit to Samsung Captivate.  In addition, you have to make sure the surface is totally clean, or just a very small particle of dust would leave a nice noticeable bubble.  One tip: use duct tape to clean the screen is more effective than a cloth.  Once I successfully put it on, it looked pretty good to me.  It did cost me the whole package of 5 to get one piece on nicely without bubble. It got some small scratches from the key set in my pocket after a month, so I probably had to replace it after 3 months or so.  Well, consider of the price I pay I am still happy with it.Pro: Nicely fit, low price.Con: Very hard to put on. Not perfectly scratch resistance.",3
This screen protector was okay. I don't really have a complaint for it. it went on smoothly and didn't scratch.,4
"For the price not so bad, but be prepared to use all the screen protectors in a short period of time. 1 or two will go to waste because once it is placed wrong there is nothing you can do but throw it away at try another one. Once you put the screen protector the fit is great, but the protection not so much. You will find that the screen protector has a lot of scratches in a matter of weeks.It protects your phone for a little bit but you will find that you need to replace the screen protector soon. Seemed like the best deal at first until i tried Skinomi skin protectors. These skin protectors will last you longer that your phone or tablet.",2
So I bought this considering it had decent reviews. The quality is very poor. The glass separates from the screen and I have to push it down to 'reseat' it. Low quality adhesive? Who knows. Also it does not come with the mesh that goes behind the ear piece speaker. So if you look at the front of your phone it looks not-OEM. Also my screen is darker in the center. I noticed this when using the camera and on certain apps. So the outside of the screen is light while about the size of a quarter in the center is darker. Very annoying. I hope the seller see's this and tries to make it right.BE WARNEDBuy another screen. This one is cheap quality and not worth your money.,1
we had to replace the screen for my iphone4 the screen arrive fast and it fits perfect now my phone works and looks like new,5
"its a good product but not as strong as the original it will break easier so be careful, really easy to change",4
"I used this for its most common purpose, to replace a cracked screen.  Using this, along with the guide from ifixit.com (see Display Assembly guide), I was able to replace the screen without issue, and it looks and functions just like the day the phone came out of the box.Of course, the procedure for replacing the screen is somewhat tedious, and there is a small chance of damaging the internals of the phone while doing so, even for someone seasoned in electronics (Apple uses adhesive, which adds this unpredictability).  Still, if your are considering paying for a replacement or new phone, I would absolutely recommend anyone who feels comfortable with assembly instructions to give this a try.  It is not as difficult as some make it out to be; as long as you keep track of each screw and part and don't rush, the average person can do this without a problem.  The only thing I would add to the aforementioned guide is to wear unpowdered gloves rather than use bare hands (the guide recommends chemicals to wipe fingerpint oil during reassembly - better to just avoid this issue entirely).Regardless, the issues involved in replacing the screen is seperate from this product itself.  Most important, if you decide to go though all of this trouble, and you finally reassemble the phone and power it on (maybe saying a prayer or two first), you can be confident that the display assembly you replaced actually does work and take a breath or two.",5
"Arrived broken. This was almost my 2nd time replacing the glass on my phone, do yourself a favor and invest in a outter box.",1
"I just bought 2 of them from this seller and installed them, are they apple original parts? the answer is no, they don't have close quality of the apple part but they work close to the original one, some reviews I read before placing my order are just none sense,this is a glas and it does not replace its self, you you don't know how to do it, simply watch youtube video or ask for help from someone who knows what they are doing, as I'm typing this review I have 4 of them in my cart to place the order because this is the 1st one close to the original screen I was able to find on market for 50% off of apple price.",4
"I just finished replacing my iPhone 4's broken screen with this kit.The process is time consuming but pretty straight forward.As far as this kit goes, there's a couple of downsides to it that forced me to knock a couple of stars off.First off, the included tools. They're decent for the most part - you'll use the tiny phillips head mostly. But the screwdriver won't hold much of a magnetic charge - and believe me, it would just about be impossible to do this repair without a magnetic screwdriver. I even swiped my own magnet across the tip of the screwdriver from time to time but it didn't help at all. I ended up using the included magnetized torx screwdriver to place the screw. There were no torx screws that I came across so maybe that's why they included it - because it was a better magnet.The 2nd problem with the screw driver is that it's such low quality that by the time I finished putting the phone back together I had to use my own jeweler's screwdriver to put the last 2 screws in because the phillips head on the included one had just ground down to a point of uselessness.The screen itself is decent but not a perfect replacement.The touch screen seems just as responsive as before so I have no complaints there - but it's not as bright or vibrant as the stock screen. The display is a little dimmer and the colors are a bit washed out.But all in all, it beats walking around with a broken screen.",3
"i watched one of the videos on youtube to guide me through the whole process.it works well so far.the quality is good.except for one thing...the screw driver that comes with this product is BAD...it messed up one of the screws... good thing i stopped before it messed the screw up even more.i had to stop in the middle and buy another one...other than that, im satisfied.",5
I rolled the dice and bought this screen.  It came packaged very well and the quality is pretty much indistinguishable from my original.,5
"This screen worked great. Install was a little tricky as it was my first time to replace a screen, but overall a great product!",5
After spent time to replace this NEW iPhone 4 GSM replacement Digitizer Glass Screen and excited to power up.  What a DISAPPOINTED when the apple sits on light white background rather a solid black background.It was a WASTED time for me to replace this screen LCD.  After I spent money and still stuck with a bad NEW screen.I would NEVER buy from this vendor again.  CRAP part.,1
"The iphone screen shipped fast, got it in 2 days with prime, the screen does look slightly different in sunlight for some reason , it works good however if pressure is placed on the top or bottom off screen you can see white pressure like pushing on an old lcd while its on which is not an issue if your not screwing around and normal use im am curious to see how it holds up long term but i will probably sell it soon to buy a newer phone",5
"For the price, this is still a great deal, but if you compare side by side with an OEM LCD, you will notice the blacks are pretty washed out.",3
I bought this because it was fairly cheap. It comes with all the tools you need. My only complaint is that this screen seems to be 1 or 2mm smaller than the OEM one. Replacing it will take a fairly long time...took me like 2-3 hours but you have to be careful and label all the parts you take off of the phone.,4
I received this item in 3business day!  I installed it myself and it work! The only downside of this product is the screwdrivers that came with it  are not magnetic and it took me forever to remove the screws and put them back bc they are so tiny.  This is why I give it 4stars.  I would highly recommend this product.,4
"My iphone 4's display was shattered so badly, there were glass shards falling off the phone.  Since it was under Applecare, I originally took it to the Apple Store.  Unfortunately, I only have Regular AppleCare, not Applecare PLUS (Plus only started recently).  Regular Applecare does not have any protection against breakage.  So they were nice, but no help.  Apple quoted $149 to replace the display.I found several local electronics stores which would repair the display for labor ($50-$75) + parts ($75-$100).  Instead, I took a chance with this $25 replacement screen from Amazon.  The item arrived very well packaged with the 7-in-1 toolkit (the toolkit is just a hodgepodge of parts...for example, one of the 'tools' was a guitar pick!).  There were No instructions.  And the quality of the tools isn't the greatest.  BUT, all the tools were sturdy enough to complete the task.  Even the guitar pick came in handy to separate the original screen from the iphone body.  Start-to-finish, the process took about an hour.  I just followed the step-by-step YouTube instructions posted by 'InjuredGadgets'.It's just so cheap...For $25, I can't complain, and so I give it the full 5-stars.One tip: The iphone screws are extremely tiny.  So I had to use my own tools to magnetize the provided screwdriver.  I'm not sure I could've done the repair without this trick.",5
"This item shipped FAST.  I was surprised how fast I received it.Instead of complaining about how difficult it was to install, I did the SMART thing and looked up on YouTube &#34;Installing DIY&#34; and followed along.  Less than 30 minutes and I had a like new phone!  Works great!  I now replace screens for my friend's iPhones and Androids!Other reviews state that you should have a sheet of paper with an outline of your phone so you can keep track of the screws, this is GREAT advice!I continue to purchase to fix other's phones.  ALWAYS shipped fast and a great/solid product!",5
"My iPhone works great, it came with everything that was promised. It was fairly easy to removed just fallow the YouTube videos and shows you step by step just be careful when pulling the wires out and when connecting the. defiantly will buy again if I ever need it again",5
"I've bought a bunch of Zeetron iPhone 4 replacement screens and until now all have been almost impossible to tell from stock: fit, LCD, clarity, touch responsiveness and backlight are great.  The glass feels slightly different from stock but you can't tell unless you're holding both at the same time.My most recent purchase, though, is the first one I've seen where the backlight is a bit uneven.  If you look carefully there's a rectangle where the light is slightly brighter about 1/2' from the edges.  My friend whose phone I fixed missed it and didn't care when I pointed it out but if you're picky make sure to look carefully.  If it weren't for that I'd give it 5 stars.The tools are good and the cleaning cloth is useful even though it's about the size of a business card.",3
"It works as a replacement, but looks nothing like the original. The contrast is way brighter and is not as responsvie as the OEM screen. It wasn't hard to install, but takes a little time and steady hands with those small screws. If you need a new phone screen this would work just not as good as an original replacement from a store.",3
The screen worked good for about 2 months and then it went bad. My screen went completely black so my phone was useless until I could get a new screen put on it.,1
my son repairs cell phones and he is always looking for cheap parts and that is what he got thank you,5
The display was shipped out fast plus it also came with tools. The display looks good plus works well. This is the only place to buy a replacement screen. The price is hard to beat!,5
My screen is nice and bright white no greenish hue... Did take a while to replace screen but I just took my time.  Didn't want to damage any connections.  AWESOME!!!!!,4
I love this product because it was a great price (included tools to fix multiple devices). The one thing i did not like was that the grater where the ear goes when talking on the phone was missing so there was a bad looking hole there. Other than that everything was pretty good.,4
"I was really pleased with the quality of this screen, only gripe would be that it is slightly thicker then an OEM screen.  I would buy these again if I could get them for 25 again",5
"screen works as promised and i received the screen with everything listed.keep in mind that the screen image quality is NOT OEM, however, it beats paying $200 to an apple store.The glass is not smooth like the orignal screen (does not have anti-oil coating) and it feels to be 'normal glass', compared to the original 'gorilla glass'.  However, its been a few months now and the screen has held up well with a couple of accidents.  Note that colors are muted, but you only notice this when side by side with an original screen.Installation was not as hard as people made it out to be, but i am fairly techanically inclined.  The easiest way to keep the parts/screws organized will be a piece of tape.  I took a length of masking tape and double it upon itself to work like double-sided tape.  (you can write on the tape too for your own notes).  note that this screen does NOT come with the earpiece screen.  I removed the screen from the orignal screen and placed it in place before putting the phone back together. Took me about 30 minutes to do the entire swap.I'm no longer worried about 'if i break my screen again' =)",4
"Great product, goo pricing and excellent quality.I have purchased other screen replacements before and i have been disappointed, but this product fulfilled the expectations",5
"I didn't want to drop 100 bucks to someone to do something I thought would be pretty easy.  That said the videos on youtube are helpful but don't fully show the whole story.  The screws are really tiny.  You have to keep them organized so use a sheet or big piece of paper, take your time and have a system to mark where the screws go.Also as I said the screws are tiny so if they drop its unlikely you will find them on a dark surface so try and do the work over well lit light floor.The plastic pry bar broke almost immediately but the other tools included were an easy substitute.  The disassembly took about 30 minutes and wasn't too bad.  Make sure the two cables on the LCD and digitizer do not get folded or pinched when you thread it through.Assembly took me a long time, almost 2 hours. And once completed the LCD screen didn;t work.  I was mad!  but I went back and check the digitizer/LCD plug ins and they weren't fully flush/connected.  I fixed that and then poof! it was fixed!  Thank God.This product is a great altenative to paying someone but probably isn't for everyone.  Im sure that is why these guys advertising to fix your phone are making a ton of money.I wasn't that intimidated going into it but wasn't prepared for how long it would take.  Just make sure you have a way to secure all the screws and organize them  I used scotch tape (they are REALLY SMALL) and a diagram found one on the youtube videos.Good luck!",4
"This item came in a generic cardboard box, which was nice. I purchased it from BuyiParts. Make sure you order from a seller offering a warranty.The glass seems to be of good quality, and the screen is a refurbished original Apple screen. Only buy this if you know how to install it and are confident. It's not the easiest repair job.Two issues:* The frame size seems slightly smaller than the original, which can be an issue for cases.* Item initially had a stuck pixel, but fixed itself after a few moments. o.O",4
thank God that i found it for such a great price!! went on wonderfully. in wonderful condition and came with tools needed to assemble it. it was great!,5
This is and always is a great screen with no problems. It came in before the estimated arrival time and was wrapped like a nervous mother wrapped up her son. The only thing I don't like about these new screens is that they don't come with the speaker cover. You ALWAYS have to take the one off of your old screen and place it on the new one but that's not really a big deal. Anyway I recommend this product!,5
"I had my screen overnighted to me, and received it very promptly.  Once the screen was installed, the quality was horrible.  The screen constantly flickered and had lines throughout.  In the end, I returned it and got my money back plus shipping.  The tool kit was great and worked well.  Once I returned it, i went to [...] and just sent it to them to replace.  The quality was great, but cost about twice as much as here.",1
"After spending much time removing the &#34;guts&#34; of the Iphone, it was a great disappointment to see after successfully puting the new replacement screen/Digitizer  and the remainder parts all back together....Guess what? The screen does not work. i can hear the sounds when the phone is plugged in. I took the back off and reseated the digitizer cables. still didnt work. so, without taking the entire phone apart again, i disconnected the new digitizers two connectors and connected the original cracked &#34;working&#34; screen and sure enough it works fine. so, I confirmed the issue is with the new part. sending it back for a replacement. I doubt they even check these before shipment like they state. i would find a differnrt vendor. It's pretty much a gamble after reading all the reviews.",1
"Other than the screen being a little dimmer than the original, this screen works great! My best friend couldn't be happier!",5
"I choose this rating because the LCD screen is not a retina display I had compared it with my friends same model iPhone and his phones Quality looked more richer then this screen, but if you really don't care about that then you could get this screen. The tools weren't enough I needed a flat head screw driver for one part of the disassembly.",3
"Well, I'm not sure if I should return this or not... reason being, it was really hard to install with my big fingers, so many tiny screws.Anyway, there is a white line of light on the top of the screen intermittently, sometimes on the side and green. Otherwise it works great. Video looks great, touch works flawlessly.The Screwdrivers did not work. Neither of them. And there was no Penta screwdriver driver, so I had to order one.",3
"after installing the LCD i noticed that the digitizer is not responsive to the touch, the LCD works fine but is the digitizer part that does not work! i need a replacement part asap",1
word great very good price nothing bad what so ever thanks for having it here haha must buy if u need iy,5
"Finally got around to replacing the cracked glass on my phone.  The procedure we found on line was very detailed and slow, but the tool kit included was perfect.  This glass came with a temporary protective cover, the glass was perfect, installed fine.  Didn't work at first due to a connection that I didn't make completely - once connected fully - worked perfectly.  Same touch/feel and responsiveness as the original glass.  Awesome!Shipping - It arrived very quickly - just put the project off until now.  Also well packed and protected.",5
"Product description notes that the product is OEM, but it is clearly not. Unless you get a seller with the OEM I suppose. But, the product is fully functional and does everything I expect it to - especially for the price point. As others have mentioned, the contrast/brightness just is not up to the OEM standards. But don't listen to those exaggerating. It looks fine. You can't really tell unless you open up a full white screen. Then you will notice that this screen is just a bit offwhite/yellow.The screen is free of blemishes.. No scratches, bubbles, or dust specks. The front comes covered with a sheet of plastic, as does the back of the LCD. The touchscreen is working flawlessly. I will say that my fingers seem to stick to this glass more than the OEM when sliding across it. But I put a screen protector on it, so that is not a big deal. Some noted that this screen is thicker than OEM. I guess I got lucky as mine is not. If it is, the difference is minuscule. The home button is almost flush.It came with a toolkit, but I can't review it as I have my own which works fine. They don't appear to be great quality. But does come with all you need - mine included the pentalobe screwdriver too (although my phone doesn't have those screws). Some have noted that the screwdrivers are not magnetized. Quick fix for that is to get a few small magnets and stick them on the screwdriver for a day or two. Then they will be. Or just leave the magnets on while you work. Not having a magnetized screwdriver makes this replacement a challenge.The description also noted that the product comes with a free installation voucher. I didn't see one (not that I would have used it). I recommend the vendors include instructions or links to instructions as there were none with mine. But the install was rather painless. Just lay out a white piece of paper and place the screws on it in a grid as you remove them. Some people even draw the shape of the phone on the paper and place the screws accordingly.  Look up videos on the process as they walk you through all the steps. The most important step is to make sure you don't get the cables from the screen kinked when you pass them through the case. It's easy to do. And if you do, you'll probably need to buy another replacement.Also, keep in mind that this does not come with the proximity screen or the home button. So be sure to scavenge those from your previous screen or purchase new ones.Overall, if you want or need to replace your screen and want to save, this is the way to go. I can't vouch for the durability of the screen yet, but it saved me a lot of money. Especially since I'm just trying to use my iPhone 4 until the next generation of the iPhone (whatever comes after the 4S).Since I was worried about which vendor to choose, and there are few reviews noting which vendor they went with, I figured I would note the vendor I used - BuyiParts. I'm very pleased with the service and product.",4
"Very good product, awesome quality..sometimes i have problems with the proximity sensor but with this product i dont have that problem. I order this from SF Planet.",5
"The HTC battery in my Nexus One lasts about 8-9 hours with heavy use, so I bought this Powergen battery as a backup battery.  After an initial extended charge and full discharge cycle as recommended by Powergen, I find that it lasts at least as long as the OEM battery (maybe marginally longer).I have no complaints and recommend it.A couple suggestions:1) Root your phone and useSetCPU- it can dramatically extend battery life, especially under heavy use.  With light use (email, browsing for 1-2 hours, 4-5 phone calls for &lt; 10 minutes each), the battery charge decreases from 100% to ~50% in 24 hours.  It takes a day or two to figure out a SetCPU configuration that works for you.  With really heavy use (described below), the battery charge decreased from 100% to ~20% in ~9 hours, at which point I'd switch batteries.2) Get aPowerGen Rapid Battery Charger. Works great.  I was out of town for about a month, and relied exclusively on my phone for email, browsing, editing small documents, and off course phone calls.  One battery would run from about 7:00 AM - 4:00 PM, and the second battery would go to about 40% by time I went to bed (~10:00 PM).  I'd charge one battery overnight in the phone, and the other in the Powergen charger.  Worked great!Overall, this has worked as well as could be expected.The battery and charger run about $14 each.  Not bad at all, considering that an HTC-branded battery alone is much more than that.",5
"I used ours for 2 years we have two batteries.  Would love to sell them and charger if you need it, aiken grl 82 at gmail . c o m ,,,They worked just like the factory ones, nothing special , just replacement phower",3
My OEM battery wouldn't last a day after 1.5 years of use. This new battery leaves me with 50% at the end of the day. So it works!,5
"Purchased right before a week long business trip.  I knew I would be thrashing my battery during the day, so I opted to get a backup.  It helped out immensely!  Did not run any calibration on it, so I can't give any technical details to describe actual performance.  It felt as though it worked pretty darn well, though.  Used a generic desktop charger to charge phone and battery simultaneously.  Worked like a charm!Good price.....fast shipping......BINGO!",4
"I have had my Nexus One for 14 month now and charged it almost daily during this time. I noticed that the battery is starting to degrade and that it no longer lasts for a full day when sync and Wifi are on. So I ordered this battery as a replacement. After going through about a dozen charge cycles with it, I can report that it lasts 4-8 hours depending on use, which is about half the time of the 14 months old original battery. This seems to be in line with what other buyers observed. I switched back to the old battery. I suppose I could use the new one as an emergency backup battery on longer trips, but without an external charger that is more of a hassle than a benefit, so I ended up not using it at all.",2
"I have used two different Blue tooth headsets with my cell phone, plus a wired set.  Each solution for hands-free cell phone use had it's pros and cons.  The wired set was easy to connect but the wires were cumbersome and distracting.  The Blue Tooth sets eliminated the wires, but charging was a pain, and I have always had mixed results with maintaining a solid connection.With that history, I was a bit wary about whether this Plantronics speakerphone would really offer any value.  I like that I can charge it with my computer, or in the car, with the same cable. (The USB dongle plugs into the car lighter adapter just like my Itouch charger, into a USB port on your computer.)  It took only two hours to charge via the USB cable and my computer. You simply clip the unit to your visor.  It slips on and off quite easily.  Pairing was the easiest I have found yet with any Blue Tooth product.  You push the multi-function button on the speakerphone to turn it on.  You turn on your cell and search for Blue Tooth devices.  My cell phone immediately detected the speakerphone and boom, I was paired and ready to go.  You can adjust the volume and make and receive calls through the speakerphone itself, or switch to FM mode with one button press, and use your stereo speakers instead.  Since the unit talks, it even tells you what FM station/frequency you should turn to.  Or, of course you can change the frequency.The speaking function of the unit is what I like better than my headsets.  It tells me when it turns on, it tells me when it has automatically paired with my phone when I turn it back on, and it tells me it is turning off when I shut it down.  All functions are handled through one big button in the middle of the unit.  With the voice confirmations, I always get confirmation of the desired action (on, off, pairing) without having to read my cell phone screen to check pairing or check the power light to see if the unit is on or off.  The charge will last longer if you turn the unit off when you exit the car, but it shuts down automatically if you haven't made a call in 90 minutes.  But in any event, you could leave the charging cord in the car and charge in the car without ever having to take the unit out of the car, which is a great option.Call quality is great.  I use this in California, where hands-free cell phone use while driving is the law.  I use this speakerphone all the time and no one has ever asked or even detected that I am using a speakerphone. The unit also allows me to push the button and terminate the call, and of course the unit talks and confirms that the call has ended.The Plantronics also allows the option for voice dialing through your cell phone, but since I have had very mixed results with voice recognition with my cell phone I haven't really tried it through this speakerphone.I am quite happy with this unit because I like it better than my Blue Tooth headsets.  I am not a guy to walk around with a bluetooth earpiece, so the lack of Blue Tooth functionality when I am outside my car isn't really a problem.If you would prefer a hands-free solution that is easy as pie to use and doesn't require an earpiece, I think you will be pleased with this speakerphone.",5
"I'm not an expert when it comes to Bluetooth Hands-free devices and my only experience comes from owning theMotorola T505 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker (Bulk Packaging)and theMotorola Motonav TN765T 5.1-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator, so when I compare the PLANTRONICS K100, keep that in mind. Both of the above hands-free speaker devices by Motorola (one being a GPS device with hands-free capability) are a little old, so I'm sure that there are better units with improved features available today.My phone is the Motorola Droid (1) and before the OS (Operating System) update that happened in Feb 2010(?) there was an issue with Droid phones not being able to place calls using a hands-free device. The only way to place a call was to use the phone itself and not through the external device, so no hands-free dialing, which is why I never purchased a newer hands-free device, but the update has fixed that issue.First, the things that I like about the PLANTRONICS K100:* Thin and relatively lightweight compared to the Motorola T505.* Large volume dial on face.* Pairs with phone quickly and easily.* Charging light goes off when fully charged.* Voice says 'Power On/Off,' which is better than a series of tones.* Comes with USB charger and car/cigarette adapter so you can charge in your car or through your USB port on your computer.Now the bad stuff:* Bare minimum of directions.* No confirmation before dialing. The unit will dial the first number it pulls up after speaking the contact's name and phone number type.* Holding down the button to place a call and you have to wait for the second beep.* FM radio transmission's volume is way too low, but this might have to do with my area.I wouldn't have minded the bare minimum of directions but it failed to mention that if you want to cancel a wrongly dialed number, you must hit the call/power button. The phone dialed two wrong numbers -- not wrong numbers, but wrong parties -- because I kept saying 'No' after the voice announced who it was calling. On the Motorola T505, the voice will announce the contact and wait for you to confirm that it is the right party and the right number (mobile, home, work etc) before dialing. The PLANTRONICS will just place the call after it announces the name and type of number, and hopefully it's the right one or you'll be embarrassed like I was.Holding down the power button for two-seconds to place a call is also a major distraction while driving. Since the unit is on the car's sun-visor it's very awkward to reach up, hold down the button and wait for the two-seconds/two beeps with one hand, while keeping your hand on the wheel with the other; hold it too long and the unit turns off, hold it too short and nothing happens. It would have been better to just hit the button once to activate the voice-dialing feature, but then that would have required a dedicated call button, which I would have preferred.Using my car's FM radio to listen to the calls isn't worth it, but that might have to do with being in an urban city with lots of interference. I have to turn the volume way up on the radio just to hear the caller and it sounds muffled. However, that's the same deal with the T505.So if you need to have a hands-free speaker device in your car for the occasional call from friends and such, and you don't want to get a ticket for using your cell phone while driving, the PLANTRONICS K100 isn't too bad for an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker device. But if you're using your cell phone in the car a lot, I would go with something a little more substantial than this unit.",3
"I drive a fair amount on the highway, about 70 miles a day.  That means a lot of high speed and a better than average amount of road noise when I call.  So I definitely appreciate a speakerphone that makes it easier to be heard and understood.I should note my only other Bluetooth speakerphones were both integrated into GPS devices, but this device left them both far behind in sound quality - especially in regards being clearly understood by the other person. I beleive the reason for the great improvement over my GPS is that the K100 has dual microphones and signal processing.Setup of the K100 was pretty easy even though my wife tossed the instructions before I got to glance at them. Plug it in, charge it for about 45 minutes the first time. With the power still of I went into pairing mode by holding the center button until the RED led lights up and it says 'pairing'( On my phone it shows up as PLT_K100 ).  Could not be much more simple than that.I have not used the FM feature as of yet, for 2 reasons.  First, on my daily travels, the 'open' frequency choices vary several times.  But secondly, there is no need for me to mess with it , for me, because the speaker is more than loud enough, and crystal clear.Also appreciated is the EXTRA long standby time.  Considering my cell phone is a battery hog and is usually using my charger cord when I drive, I am glad I rarely need to recharge the K100. I look forward to when Froyo (2.2) comes along and I can use Vlingo over my K100. They say the standby time is about 15 days, but I have been charging it about every 10 days or so.Another plus was the clear documentation on the website.  While at the moment it is down for maintenance, I did find it useful after the instructions were accidentally tossed out.",4
"As with other bluetooth's...or would that be blueteeth?...anyway, as with others I've used, the receiving sound is fine on my end.  However, for the person talking to me, the sound cuts-out and I end up having to repeat myself a lot.  So, the sound quality is not that great.  It is nice to have though for when I'm driving.  I like to keep both hands on the wheel.  This product allows me to do so.It seems to be of equal quality as the Bluetooth ear piece.  If you have tried those and liked them then you will probably be happy with this item.",3
"doesn't always pick up calls and get some wind noise,  Siri is not always easy to use either. but it is better than a ticket ;-)",4
"I mostly use Bluetooth speakerphones for streaming music via FM and also for telephone calls.Generally, I cannot recommend this unit.  First, let's talk about streaming music and then we can talk about using it to make and receive phone calls.Unlike other similar Bluetooth devices, there is no button to move the track forward or backwards a track.  So if you want to do this, you have to fumble with your phone while you are driving (dangerous), or hold down the center button *exactly* the right amount of time to bring up Siri and tell it to skip a track.  Awkward and time consuming.I believe there are only 5 FM frequencies, so if they are occupied, you are out of luck.  Just ridiculous.I mentioned that center button.  Functions that are controlled by multiple buttons on other similar devices are controlled by just one button on this thing.  And if you don't hold it down precisely the proper number of seconds, something unintended will occur.  Want to answer the phone?  You might get Siri.  Or maybe turn the unit off altogether.Sound quality is ok on the receiving end, but a party on the other line had trouble hearing me.I can't recommend this Speakerphone, which is a surprise, as Plantronics usually makes good products.  2 stars and I suggest that you avoid.",2
"More and more cars are coming with bluetooth integrated in them.  Unfortunately having bought my car before those gadgets existed, I didn't get to have this nice integration.  Now there are a series of products that make it easy to do so.The in-car speakerphones seem to have many of the same features.  Essentially a device that you can pair your phone to via bluetooth, and then talk to people through it.  This device even has an FM transmitter, when this is enabled, and your radio tuned, the call audio comes through your speakers (mics are still used on the device itself).This particular device has a couple of usability things with it.  One is that the power button is shared with other functionality.  This also means to turn it on/off you have to hold your finger on the button for multiple seconds, instead of just easily flipping a switch.  It also means if you're going to use voice control on your phone holding this same button (since it doubles as the 'phone' button), you have to make sure to release exactly when it beeps, one second longer and it shuts off on you.  The other one is the volume 'ring', it seems to only adjust the volume when a call is connected, other times you're spinning it and nothing is happening.  Would have rather this have been a physical dial as well.It does have a lot of the advanced features, such as A2DP pairing, meaning you can connect your smart phone, or music player (that supports A2DP) to the speakerphone, and then connect that to the radio and have your music play wirelessly (and in the case of some smart phones, control what is playing by voice as well).  It also has dual microphones to prevent echo, and because of this people on the other end hear you loud and clear.  The one thing it doesn't have it synching your address book to it, and then when you receive a call, it telling you who is calling, although I'm not sure how valuable this feature is.In summary this is a little speakerphone that lasts a long time, has very good call quality, and has most of the advanced features.  A couple of design choices prevent this from getting a full 5 stars, but it's a great product nonetheless.",4
"Plantronics has been around a long time. Since 1961 to be exact. That's a lot of experience in perfecting audio technology. Unlike some technology companies that were left in the dust by newer, more nimble companies, Plantronics has done an admirable job of keeping up with the latest advances. Their Bluetooth headsets in particular, are among the best that money can buy. The K100 Bluetooth Speakerphone is their very first device of its kind in Plantronics' stable of products. And just like their headsets, it is an impressive product.PROS:- Simple to use- Quick connection- Good audio quality- Voice announcements- Great battery life- Good valueCONS:- Average noise cancellation- Volume level could use an increaseFor nearly as long as I have been using mobile phones (since 1996), I have been using headsets. I got my first wireless Bluetooth headset in 2005 and they have become an absolute necessity in my mobile arsenal. When California banned the use of mobile phones while driving without a hands-free device, I recommended headsets to all my friends and family. My wife's headset ended up at the bottom of her purse, never to be heard from again. It dawned on me that perhaps headsets weren't an ideal solution for everyone. I was used to spending a few minutes pairing my headset to my phone and inserting it in my ear before putting my car in gear, but I'm getting the sense that not everyone finds that convenient. When I observed my wife struggling to hear a caller through her phone's speakerphone, I found it unacceptable and began researching Bluetooth speakerphones.USABILITYThe initial pairing process of the K100 was very easy and quick. Once the pairing process was completed, it connected to my Motorola Droid X very quickly each and every time. In fact, it connected faster than any headset I'd ever used. Why is this important? Because I don't leave my Bluetooth feature on all the time and sometimes when I'm on the road, I'll get a call and have to quickly turn it on. If the headset, or speakerphone in this case, takes too long to connect, I may miss the call before I can answer it. I did have an issue with the K100 not connecting to a phone it'd been paired to, but was not the last phone connected to it. I added a second phone to the K100 and it connected great. But when I went to connect the first phone I had paired, it would not connect. I was on the road so I could not troubleshoot it while driving. In that situation, the K100 was supposed to connect just by tapping the multifunction button once.The K100 only has 3 buttons and a volume dial. There is a button to turn on or off the FM transmitter, a multifunction button, and a mic mute button. All the buttons are large and easy to locate and actuate. The volume dial is notched so you can just spin the dial to increase or decrease the volume. The dial however, free spins 360 degrees. There is no end point to let you know that you are at max volume, nor is there is an indicator to let you know what level the volume is set to. You do get a voice prompt that tells you that it's at max volume though. The multifunction button turns the K100 on/off, takes and ends calls, rejects calls, and performs a few other functions. I wish that Plantronics would have created a single power button or switch though. Three or four seconds may not seem like a lot of time to wait, but it can get a bit cumbersome to wait those few seconds when you're in a hurry. The mic mute button actually has two functions. Tapping it will mute or unmute the mic. Pressing it down for 2 seconds will activate or deactivate 'night mode', which just means it will turn off the LED so it doesn't distract you while driving at night.I also really appreciated the voice announcements on the K100. Rather than trying to decipher a series of beeps, the unit's female voice will tell you any number of useful information. Some of the alerts include, Power On/Off, Battery Low, Lost Connection, Call Terminated, Connected, Mute On/Off, and more. I was spoiled by the voice status alerts on myPlantronics Discovery 975headset so I was pleased to see this carry over to the K100 speakerphone.Overall, I found the usability of the K100 to be very simple and easy enough for even non-technical people to use. I would have no problems recommending it to my parents or other technophobes.AUDIO QUALITYI found the audio quality of the speaker to be more than adequate for conversation. My only complaint was that in my SUV with rather loud all-terrain tires, it didn't seem to get loud enough at times. Turning up the volume on my phone helped, but the point of using the hands-free device is to be able to control the most important functions easily without having to fuss with the phone itself. When I had my radio turned down and my kids were quiet or absent in the vehicle, people on the other end of the call said I could be heard perfectly without the typical hollow speakerphone sound. Unfortunately, when my children were present, it didn't do as good a job of canceling out the noise that my Plantronics headsets are capable of doing. Still, I feel I'm nitpicking a little bit since it should be rather easy to obtain a fairly quiet environment inside a vehicle. The lack of a more advanced noise cancellation technology probably serves to keep the cost down and achieve better value.FM TRANSMITTERUntil I received the K100, I didn't know that it had a built-in FM transmitter. I found out that a couple of other speakerphones on the market also have this feature, but I was pleasantly surprised. I did keep my expectations in check though, since my experiences with FM transmitters have been very mixed over the years. My problems with FM transmitters in general are that they rarely perform consistently and the sound quality tended to be poor. To my delight, the K100's FM transmitter worked fantastically! When I pushed the FM transmitter button, I was prompted by voice to tune my FM radio to the station it recommended. The 5 frequencies that the K100 uses are 88.3, 88.7, 89.1, 89.5, and 89.9. Though 88.3 wasn't completely clear of audio from the radio, once the transmitter decided to use it, it superseded whatever source that frequency had been receiving signals from. Since the K100 supports A2DP, I was able to use the music player on my Droid X to listen to MP3s as well as my streaming audio apps like Pandora and Slacker. GPS navigation instructions also fed through to my car speakers flawlessly.BATTERYThe lithium-ion polymer battery inside the Plantronics K100 speakerphone takes 2.5 hours to fully charge. Since it's a lithium-ion battery however, you can top it off at any time without worrying about discharging it fully in order to get the best performance out of it. Talk time is rated at 17 hours and standby at 15 days. Included in the box is a micro USB cable and a cigarette lighter adapter. Since the charging port of the K100 is micro USB, the same as my Droid X, I was able to use all of my Droid X chargers to charge the K100. The micro USB cable is very handy. Imagine this scenario. You're driving into work and while using the K100, you hear the voice status alert say, 'low battery', which means you have about an hour of battery life left. You want to use the K100 on the drive home but you've already made it to the office and can't just sit in a parked car charging the K100! Well, with the micro USB cable, you can bring the K100 inside the office with you and just plug that puppy in to your computer's USB port and in a couple of hours, will have a fully charged K100 for your drive home-yay!MISCNo doubt, Bluetooth speakerphones are extremely convenient. They mount easily to your vehicle's sun visor and you get to be a good law-abiding citizen while you close that last big sale of the quarter or talk to your spouse about your kid's birthday party planning. Great. But um, has anyone considered what happens when it's sunny out and you know, you actually have to flip your sun visor down?? Now you have to remove it and flip the speakerphone to the other side, which probably isn't the safest maneuver to perform while driving in direct sunlight. My idea? Make a magnetic mount that allows the speakerphone to be quickly removed from one side and placed on the other.CONCLUSIONThe Plantronics K100 Bluetooth Speakerphone is a great hands-free solution for your vehicle. It's easier to deal with than headsets and great for people who don't like sticking things inside their ear. The K100's versatility is magnified with support of A2DP and the inclusion of a surprisingly functional FM transmitter. If you or someone you know refuses to use headsets, the K100 is a great alternative and definitely worth a look. Heck, I love using my headsets but I think I just might end up using the K100 a lot more.* Review sample courtesy of Plantronics, Inc.",4
"I have to admit I was skeptical about this product but after using it for a few weeks, I can tell you this is the real deal.  Good call quality, fairly intuitive to use, and works well.  I've been genuinely impressed and I can recommend it.  I haven't tried the FM features yet, I'll report back when I do.",5
"On my business phone, I have a plantronics headset and amplifier.  People hear me loud and clear.In the state of California you may not talk on the cellular phone (oh thank you) while driving, hence numerous bt speakerphones are popping up like weeds.  I bought the blue ant from amazon a while back and in my vine review they asked me to look at the plantronics.  Each has strengths and weaknesses.The blueant is clearly the winner here - it just sounds better, and in fact, being an audio snob, I do not detect the blue ant as being a speakerphone when it is used.  Everything sounds normal.  BUT there is a big piece missing - the blue ant is geared towards the newer i-phone / g-phone devices and leaves out the older designs by motorola with metal cases and ease of use.  The good part is that the audio quality is SOO good with the ant that you can actually speak to your phone and have it understand you - my plantronics earpiece couldn't be recognized by my older phones!Now plantronics has entered the world of visor clip, cig charger speakerphones.  They did some neat things - like having two microphones.  While I guess that is meant to improve the performance, sadly it doesn't.  The plantronics speakerphone sounds like a speakerphone, and not holding the phone to your ear despite all their magic dsp technology.  I was enthused that a company like plantronics would 'get it right the first time' but it's a speakerphone - no doubt.It does have some features to access your telephone (again, i/g phone) directory quickly which seem to work, and it does have some neat features if your phone is dictating directions to you - you can press a button and listen to them on an unused FM station in the car.  Unfortunately  - by the time the phone synthesizes the voice, puts it over bluetooth 2.1, then the plantronics modulates it over FM - well - you know the rest of the story - it doesn't sound as good as using the speakerphone inside your phone itself.  It's just LOUDER.I own probably close to 6 BT devices and none of them live up to their reputation of being a crystal clear perfect audio link.  As for that - the latest version of the ant comes the closest because I don't yell at people using it that they are being cut off by the windshield wipers, etc.  I lament that the BT standard does not give us the quality we asked for in its creation.",3
"I like the sound quality and the FM feature is nice but it does not play well with my Samsung Galaxy 4s.  Let me explain, none of the voice active features work.  I cannot voice dial or give in instructions hand-free with it.  It does do fine at answering calls and my podcast go through it and into the FM, MapQuest goes through it, but not being able to use the Samsung hands free features irritates me.  Still overall happy.  good phone quality will make up for most anything with one of these things.  It is after all about the call quality.",4
"this BT speaker is OK, the sound is not loud enough, but with dual mic, people can hear me clearly. so far so good",3
"This is a decent speakerphone in its basic functionality. And it is quite basic; it doesn't even have voice caller ID, which several other speakerphones at this price seem to have. It was very easy to pair, and the controls are easy to manage. Callers sound very clear over the speaker, it has plenty of volume, and the echo cancellation works well. However, I've had quite a bit of trouble with callers hearing me once there is significant road noise, probably beginning around 45mph in my vehicle and getting far worse as I approach highway speeds of 70mph. Driving around town at slower speeds, I haven't had any trouble at all being heard. If road noise is very quiet in your vehicle, with very little difference in the noise level between slow speeds and highway speeds, this may not be an issue, but it can be quite frustrating, and I'd expect better from Plantronics. I hadn't previously had any such trouble using the built-in speakerphone on my cellphone.An even worse flaw is the FM transmitter. I was particularly excited about this feature since it supports A2DP, which would allow broadcasting music from my phone in stereo, but that's just not feasible in the end. There seems to be a fixed set of frequencies available, all within 88-90MHz. Though I thought the instructions implied that the device would automatically find a clear frequency as some do now, this is not the case, as mine landed on at least two frequencies occupied by local radio stations. And even on a clear frequency, there was far too much static to use for phone calls, much less listening to music. And my antenna is on the left side of the roof, which is less than a foot away from this device when it's clipped on the visor. Other FM transmitters have worked just fine in my vehicle. The FM transmitter feature is absolutely unusable for me, and I'm very surprised and disappointed.Overall this isn't a bad speakerphone, as long as you don't have much road noise in your vehicle and don't plan to use the FM transmitter.",3
good sound quality and easy to use but lacks features present in others,2
"We only got to use the device briefly, because when The Wife and I got new cars, both are bluetooth equipped and a $15 tracfone is all you need to pair with the cars' electronics.  That said, the Plantronics speakerphone works as advertised if your car is older.  The sound quality wasn't quite as good as in the new cars, but the hands-free option is totally worthwhile.",4
"How come so many of the name brand companies are putting out crap, when you can spend half or a third of the price and get a fantastic product like this speakerphone? I was leery of this unit because of the price... I am really glad I gave it a try. It connects easily, works well, easy to hear, easy to be heard. I tried it the other day, at highway speeds, with both front windows and my sunroof open, and other than some wind noise, the person I called heard everything I was saying. It's supposed to have a long battery life, but I used a longer USB cable so I could keep it hooked it up. It charges when it needs to and works great. GREAT GREAT PRODUCT !!!!!!",5
"I have struggled with Bluetooth as a technology in my life over the past few years.  On one hand, I feel that the headsets are practically ubiquitous, seen attached to the ears of millions of people, from teens to adults.  Yet, when I have used the headsets, I find them cumbersome for the following reasons:A) It's yet another thing I have to charge and make sure it is chargedB) It's yet another thing to carry and possibly loseC) I have had mixed experiences with the headsets on both transmitting and receiving ends; sometimes the connection is wonky.  This, combined with less-than-stellar cellular connections makes for maddening frustration.  Is it the cell phone?  Is it the bluetooth headset?  I don't know!D) Though some are comfortable to wear, I just don't like to wear them all the time in my ear.  Thus, I am constantly fumbling around to find it when the phone rings, sometimes while driving, which frankly may be more dangerous than just talking on the phone while driving.What I love about this product is that it solves a BUNCH of these issues in an elegant way.A) By living in the car, having a much bigger battery, and having an elegant car charger right there, charging is no longer an issue.  (The trade off is that it is more limited to the car, perhaps, but not totally so: the charger is also USB compatible so any computer should do as well!)B)Since I leave it in the car, nothing to lose, nothing to forget! (Trade off: I can't really use it while walking around... but for  me that's okay)C) The connection on this unit has been rock solid.  The audio is very good, all things considered, but that is why I remove one star.  I think that it is probably hard to get this PERFECT, given the nature of the device, the highly-variable environment inside of different cars, etc., but I think that it could even be better in the future.  For me, the output is clear but has a bit of a tinny quality that can make voices a bit harder to hear in the car environment.  (Note: I have not paired it with an FM station--this is just the speaker of the unit I am referring to; I am sure this will be better and I will give that a try, but I want to mention this as well.).  The microphone and echo-cancelling seems absolutely top-notch.D) I absolutely love that it lives on my visor and is only a button-push away, with an easy, beautifully tactile volume control.  The ergonomics are stellar here!I want to add that this is a very featured unit that also has a2dp which can allow use with a computer or an iPad as well, though the speakerphone nature of this makes it a little less useful for such a purpose.  (That is to say, a headset/headphone setup gives you privacy and quiet while this is just another speaker and mic that are wireless.)In sum, this is an excellent device for folks who want a convenient hands-free setup in the car, has very good audio, exemplary ergonomics and solves a number of problems endemic to headsets.  Highly Recommended.",4
"Literally one of the best BT products I've ever used. It does almost everything I need a hands free kit to do. Easy install, great connection, very clear audio on both ends. Unfortunately it falls short in one area, ring volume.It's very, very low with no options to increase it. You cannot hear it over road noise or the radio. I missed every call while I owned it. If low ring volume is not an issue I would highly recommend this item. For me not hearing the phone ring is a deal breaker. So disappointing that Plantronics would make such a great product and completely miss this crucial element.",4
"This is an excellent hands-free device for in-car phone use. It it easy to use, connects without any problems, and has several great essential features, such as the ability to send its audio signal through a radio. The battery life is very fair; I've only had to charge it twice since using it (somewhat sparingly) about a month ago. The microphone works great, and most of the time, whomever I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a speakerphone.The only trouble I have with it is that when I'm driving at high speeds, it's a little hard to hear through the built-in speaker. HOWEVER, I must note that I drive a sports car with a loud engine and fairly loud exhaust, and I think that in a quieter car, this won't be a problem. I only mention it for the benefit of those potential buyers who also have loud vehicles, or who anticipate trying to use the K100 in places where there is significant external noise. As I mentioned, I can send the audio to my car's stereo, and then there's no problem, so this isn't a big deal, but potential buyers who are reading this review should be aware of my experience.To summarize, it works well, is easy to use, and isn't overly complicated. Recommended!",4
"The sound quality for both ends is very good.  Noise reduction works great.  It's nice that it has a FM transmitter so i can play over car's stereo system.  Not bulletproof, but glad it's a feature.  Not as mnay features as my previous Blueant but I think sound is slightly better on the Plantronics.",5
"Plantronics K100 Bluetooth Speakerphone delivers reat sound quality and easy to operate once you paired/configure it with your mobile phone. To answer a phone call, just press the button once. to initiate a redial, click the button twice, and adjust the volume with the dial button. This speakerphone is powered by rechargeable battery that last a long time both talk time and stand by time. Charged with the micro USB connector included in this package. You can use this in-car or outside your car (at home for example, if your phone doesn't have speakerphone function or your phone speakerphone isn't so great)FM transmitter functionality (to send the audio to your car radio and stereo system) isn't as good. Not 100% sure if it is just the limitation with all FM signal/transmitter or the signal quality from this Plantronics K100 Bluetooth Speakerphone isn't as good. So if you plan to mainly use this as FM transmitter (vs the bluetooth speakerphone), I would check out some other product which might be better.Pros:1. Simple to configure and operate (with one button for everything)2. Amazong sound quality (on bluetooth connection to the speakerphone)3. Sleek design with solid clip to clip it to your car visor4. Long battery life and built in rechargeable battery5. Voice alerts6. Audio Distribution Profile feature enable you to stream music etcCons:1. FM transmitter quality/sound quality is not very good2. Ringer volume is low (use your phone ringer instead)Sidarta Tanu",5
"I bought this because I just traded in one car for another and my new one doesn't have integrated bluetooth, which I've become very accustomed to.The pluses:  it works great, is small and disconnects automatically to save on battery.  Has voice to tell you when it disconnects.The minuses:  it says &#34;disconnected&#34; when using it with my smartphone while the phone is connecting, so it is a bit annoying, but not too bad.  It has to be charged regularly if you use it alot.In my prior cars with integrated bluetooth, I got a lot of complaints from people about the road noise (even in my quiet BMW) and I sometimes had a hard time hearing without really cranking the volume up. I've used this one a few times now and no complaints, so I think it is really good about canceling out the noise.  It has an easy to use volume adjustment right on it so on the hearing end, no problems. It is relatively small, fits right up on the visor - really thin, you don't even notice it's there.  You can just press a button to connect and it works great.It has the FM connectivity if you want to integrate it with your car speakers, but I think the sound through the speaker is fine as is.The only thing I don't like is having to charge it, but you have to do that with any of them. I just keep the charger in the car and charge when I'm not using it.It's a great speakerphone and I highly recommend it.",5
"I hate earpieces, so this device is a welcome addition to my car.I was able to quickly set this up with my el cheapo prepaid phone.  Since it is illegal to use the phone itself in my city, but considered  ok if you are hands free (never mind that your brain is preoccupied...) this product is very useful.  I do think it is safer than using your phone, since you don't have to look away from the road to answer. Having one button to answer the phone IS less distracting.  However, you still need to use your phone to dial out if your phone does not have voice dialing.  Mine does not, and I think with voice dialing this product would be truly outstanding.The ringer volume is low, but it is easy to set this up so that the ringing happens through the radio if you desire and you also hear the other person through the radio.  This setup was simple, the device finds a station to use on its own. The device talks to you, telling you when it is on, off, which station to tune to for FM use etc.Sound quality is amazingly good.I do wish the directions were printed on the back for easy reference.Overall a great alternative to a earpiece.",5
"This device really has great features for the price point.  It paired easy, has really natural voice announcements when you change the settings, very nice control buttons/wheel.  However, when I connect to a call, it consistently has terrible quality ... loud static, popping continuously.  I tried it for a week with several different calls and locations, just never worked.",2
"This is a sophisticated radio controlled quad copter.  It has four motors/rotors, stabilization gyros, sonar?, dual video, wireless networking, and is controlled from an iphone/ipad.  This thing works very well, it has great stability, is easy to learn to fly, but is fragile if you have no previous radio control experience and try to overfly it.  Of course if you crash it into a wall too many times, it will break.  The bumper setup helps a lot but within limits!  If you take it slow and systematically, it is easy to learn and a lot of fun.I've been in radio control for a long time (mostly fixed wing aircraft) but have recently become interested in tricopters and quadcopters. I couldn't duplicate this AR Drone's level of sophistication for less than $1000.I'd recommend this for anyone with a little radio controlled helicopter experience or those with some level of radio controlled aircraft experience.  I wouldn't give this to a kid as a toy, it will break if you don't know what you are doing.Overall, my kids and I love this thing, it flies great and is easy to fly with an iPhone or iPad(preferred).UPDATE: 3/8/2011:  The best combination we found to fly the AR Drone is the iPhone 4 or iPad and the latest AR Drone firmware (I think it is 1.7).  We have learned not to get too crazy with the AR Drone because if you bang it into something, it will break and be $$$$.  We can still enjoy it in open areas but have to respect it because of how fragile it is.  The newest firmware is a great improvement, very stable, even outdoors in a 5 - 7 mph breeze.UPDATE : 5/27/11  I am changing my star rating to a 2 because this thing is so fragile and support from the company is poor.  I have been flying radio control for many years and haven't crashed this AR Drone at all.  With that being said, we still have had two failed motors and now a failed main board.  Bottom line, this thing is fun to fly but will nickel and dime you to death.  I'm not recommending it any more.",2
I am writing this review for my brother who can't type he bought this toy and was flying it and apparently spying on the neighbor lady while she was sunbathing nude.To make a long story short her husband came over the fence and beat him severely broke all his fingers and broke his jaw then stomped and broke the copter.The good news is the doctors say he should be able to eat solid food again in about 6 months.,1
"Greetings all. I was excited to get my AR Drone. I wanted a quad copter but I don't have the experience to fly the stick style helicopters offered at hobby stores. I figured this would not only fill that need but take it to the next level with the on board camera and game integration.First before you get too board of my review and stop reading :) I would like to mention there is one upgrade that is a must ... get a larger capacity battery. The stock battery does not provide enough flight time to really enjoy it. With the stock battery I am always thinking 'what a short flight'. In addition I also found that the charger time was way to long. With some research I found that there is a solution. Buying a higher grade battery that both allows for more flight time with a higher capacity is important but so is buying a higher grade battery that allows for faster charging. The problem is the stock battery is limited to 1 Amp charging which is why it take 1.5-2.0 hours to charge! and lasts less than 10 min flight time!There are levels of options, more flight time OR both more flight time and faster charging.Option A) buy two of these batteries, they offer 33% more flight time (I get around 20 min) and use the stock charger to charge the batteries. With two batteries it is plenty of flight time making charge time moot because batteries last long enough for an evening of fun.AR.Drone Parrot High Capacity LiPo replacement battery upgrade - 33% more flight time -Option B) Buy a better battery AND charger. This are many things to consider when doing this. You must pair the battery and charger. For example if you buy a 2 Amp charger the battery must be capable of charging at 2 amps. In the case of the stock batteries they are limited to 1 Amp. I found this kit offers a high amp charger (more than enough than the batteries can handle) and a battery that can be charged up to 2.6 Amps ... this means faster charge times.High Capacity LiPo Battery and Charger Upgrade Kit for the AR Drone - 33% more flight time - 45min Charge time -Anywho, on with my thoughts about the AR.Drone. What I like about this Drone is the fact that it can fly its self. If I am nervous I simply let go of the controls (figuratively, don't drop your iphone literally ... haha). This little plan has a fairly well performing flight computer that allows the newbie fly with ease.  Remember it is a small light wait flying toy so it is fragile, that being said it is well built for what it is. The hull does a good job protecting the plan when accidentally bumping objects.I recommend this for every level of user, after all when you are an ace simply convince a friend to buy one than let the dog fighting begin. When dog fighting missiles and bullets are overlay on the live video providing a fun game experience with a mix of CGI and live video. Check out the adds as I cannot do it justice with words in this review.I see my review is getting a little long so I will bring it to an end. I have no regrets buying my AR.Drone. Its a lot of fun and ready to run, as I mentioned I recommend only one upgrade which is a higher capacity battery.Happy Shopping!",4
"Just wait until NEXT Christmas to buy this gift... it should be at the point where it's 1/4 of the size/weight, 1/3 of the cost, 1/2 of the noise, and the batteries last 3 times as long.  Oh, and controlled by Android phones instead of iPhones.  It's great fun if you have the money now.... but just imagine what it's going to be like when there are hundreds of millions of these flying around.  Personally I can't wait - I'd rather have the police flying these around than wasting taxpayer dollars flying giant helicopters everywhere.",2
I got this thing setup and flying in a few minutes around the house and it's very cool. However the battery does not last as long as it should. After a couple weeks it's also not even keeping half the charge it did initially.  It really limits being able to show this around not having a charged battery on hand.I wish they had a more modern/efficient battery that could be kept in a charger at full charge and popped into it anytime you wanted to have a quick flight. Messing with these wires and leads is annoying and looks terrible if I leave it charging around my house.With a good modern battery charger and technology this would be a solid 5 stars. But as is most I can give is 3.,3
"This RC toy is a blast! I don't know what other people were doing when they crashed their drones, because I have crashed mine 50 different ways and its only suffered a single bent rotor shaft, which cost a few dollars to fix. The foam indoor hull is very forgiving and the rotors cut out if any one of them meets any resistance. this means your drone drops like a rock if it bumps a wall but because the props aren't spinning when it hits the ground you do a lot less damage to the expensive parts like the motor. it will also cut out if you flip it over or the angle is too high.fly it indoors until you get the hang of it. my only damage, the bent rotor shaft happened when I took it outside for the second flight and I crashed it into a building. the instructions say to operate it away from wifi as that could interfere. there aren't a lot of places completely free of wifi but I recommend not flying right next to your wireless router. either turn it off or fly somewhere else because interference can happen.anyone who's flown RC aircraft knows that flying means crash, rebuild, crash, rebuild-- that's the reality. do yourself a favor and buy the spare gears, rotors, and extra screws to start out. they're cheap and will seem cheaper when you don't have to wait for a few weeks to get parts while your drone is down. I recently developed a problem with connecting to my drone. I called tech support, waiting on the line for about 45 seconds, and had an RMA for a repair or replacement in about two minutes. maybe other people's experiences were from the early days after the launch but right now my only complaint is that some parts aren't well stocked.I've never experienced the uncontrolled ascent that some people have wrote about but it is a known issue. it is NOT, as people on amazon and elsewhere speculated a firmware issue. It has been demonstrated to be an issue with the ultrasonic altitude sensor becoming confused by things like tall grass or bushes, etc. the sensor works brilliantly at keeping your drone below 10 feet or just at a constant height (it only works up to 20ft). It can also auto land your drone from any height. But some surfaces can confuse it and there's not much you can do about it except avoid the ones that are known to cause problems. also if you ever do have this problem, and are clear thinking you can hit the emergency button which cuts all 4 rotors. your drone will drop and may get damaged but it won't fly away leaving you with a sad tale of woe to tell on amazon reviews. people have suggested parrot offer an option in a future upgrade to turn off the ultrasonic sensor. that may be a good option for maximum flexibility but I'm not sure its a good idea given how much of the drone's stability comes from its ability to maintain such a constant altitude.  while testing the battery life I launched the drone, it ascended to a height of about 1 meter and I left it. after about 10 minutes the battery ran low and it auto-landed less than 1 foot from where it took off!",5
"The AR.Drone is a great idea, at least the Drone part of the name, not so much the AR (augmented reality). However, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired.This is a fun toy to fly when it behaves, but it doesn't behave too often. I've had numerous very erratic behaviors from my drone. When flying full speed in a direction, the drone often flips itself over. Despite having the altitude limited setting toggled on (should keep it under 10 ft high) I've had the drone ignore the altitude and fly up into a tree, breaking a plastic part upon falling. The drone will often erratically lose altitude and bounce off the ground with the propellors still running. Or, the drone will randomly fly up into the sky, without you telling it to do so. What is so frustrating about all of these erratic behaviors, is that they eventually end up in broken parts and you have to shell out more money buying new props, gear shafts, gears, or having to send the AR Drone in for a repair. I've bought theParrot AR.Drone Mounting Toolswhich I think should be included with this product andParrot AR.Drone Replacement Gear with Shaft Setwhich is helpful since the aluminum shafts are so easily bent and the gears take a beating on some falls. I do have to give Parrot credit for creating a product so repairable and having every part available. I am impressed with how will the drone holds up to some substantial falls, but due to the erratic behavior, there are just too many bullets for it to dodge. Eventually something breaks. I've had the styrofoam indoor hull break only once, but instead of ordering Parrots repair tape, I was able to repair it with normal double sided tape.Customer service has failed to impress me. After first noticing the erratic behavior, I sent an email with my issues. Parrot never responded to my email. I had to call them and talk to someone to get a return authorization. I paid for shipping to get the drone repaired, which was about $10-15, but they paid for shipping back to me. After getting it back, it still behaved erratically. So I sent it back to them after a crash had broken a part, again paying for shipping. I received it back with the part repaired, but it appears they never tried to address the erratic behavior this time. So I called Parrot again to have them address the issues, and they were very nice over the phone, acknowledged that the erratic behavior hadn't been looked at the last time, and said they would send me a return authorization and upon asking, they said they would cover the shipping this time. However, that was around 2 months ago, and I still have not received the return authorization. I've been too busy to contact them again, but I will soon.The camera quality is very poor on both the front facing and ground facing camera. This would be understandable, if Parrot didn't photoshop in very good looking pictures onto the iPhone controllers in all their advertisements. The framerate is poor, and so the augmented reality aspect of the drone seems like it would be worthless, although I have never tried. The battery life has been surprisingly long for me, somewhere around the quoted 15 minutes, which seems like a while when you are flying.Beyond those complaints, it is a very fun toy when it works. I've enjoyed flying it when it behaves, and it is great to show to your friends or tease your dog with. Unfortunately, judging from other people's stories about their drones, I'm not convinced that my drone has anything wrong with it, but am leaning towards the conclusion that most other drones are operating like mine. It seems like Parrot bit off a bit more than they could chew and that the first generation of the AR.Drone was more of an expensive beta than a polished product.I hope this review helped. The second generation drone looks to be pretty promising. Let me know if I can answer any questions by leaving a comment.",2
"This is a must have... It is by far in my top three for 2010... the other two is the PS3 and the iPad itself. It is one of the coolest toy I've ever had. A bit pricey it is, but to have all this technology packed together in such an elegant manner... Probably most of the price is to recover all research they must had to go trough to put this together. My guess is that competitors will come out soon and the price will have to drop. I any case, enthusiasts are said to keep hobbies industry alive, so be my guest, there went my $600 for your R&D... Yes, the math is fine, I have two... no regrets!!!",5
"Just got mine delivered today, and couldn't wait to try it out.  When it's delivered, you get no additional packaging other than the AR.Drone packaging itself, which was a little surprising; but then again, it's a relatively oversized item, so it should've been expected.Opening it up, you've got the Drone itself front and center, surrounded by the various bits and pieces that come along with it (e.g., charger, battery, separate hull for outside flight, instruction manual, etc.).I read through the instructions a bit too quickly in the beginning and didn't realize that the Drone itself creates its own WiFi network for you to connect your phone to.  So when you start up the Drone, just go into your WiFi settings on the iPhone/iPod Touch and choose the Drone from the list of available networks (it should read something to the effect of AR.Network323r924 or similar).  From there, go into the AR.FreeFlight app.  When I started, it found that the Drone required a firmware upgrade, and gave me the option to upgrade it from there.  Restarted the drone, messed with some of the settings, and got started.Given the size of my apartment, I was actually surprised and pleased with the performance of the Drone.  As others have said, you need to be aware that it'll compensate for obstacles by increasing the height from the ground as it goes over them (i.e., if you're three feet up, it'll go up an additional three feet if you go over a coffee table).After charging it up for a couple hours, I took it outside for some less restrictive flight, and I gotta say: It's a far more pleasant experience when you have room to roam and not worrying about taking out a random cat here or there.So...Pros- Compared with other similarly equipped electric helicopters, this one is actually pretty fairly priced.- Very durable.  Ended up crashing it a few times inside, and it held up very well.- Very stable.  True to the videos you can find on their site, the second you let go of the controls, it levels out.- Open APIs for developers have already led to a couple additional apps in the App Store.- Two hulls, one for inside flight (with protective rings around the blades), and one for outside flight to provide additional aerodynamics.- Charging adapter includes multiple adapters to cover just about any possible charging outlet.Cons- 15 minutes of flight for 90 minutes of recharging time?  Unless you purchase extra batteries, you're gonna end up waiting a good bit o' time between charges.- Given the price of the Drone, the fact that you've got a lot of down time for charging is a huge problem.In the end, given my limited R/C helicopter experience, I'm only regretting my purchase for the price involved.  But after the flight outside, I think it's well worth it... just gotta collect some extra batteries overtime.",4
"The external, portable battery works very well!  It's not too often that I am in an area or location where there is limited or no access to an electrical outlet but when I am I can rest assured because I have my little (pocketable) battery back.  It also really nice because I don't have to get a back cover that allows for an extended battery but makes the phone hard to fit into a pocket.",4
"This portable charger is perfect for your device, specially if you have discharged your cellphone due a couple of hour to use you phone with games and some apps.Thanks.",5
"Very happy on this purchase. When fully charged it would recharge my Samsung Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch between 3 to 4 times before it discharges completely. For the size, weight and price it is really worth it. Gets me out of a hurry when I don't have an outlet available or enough time to leave it on the wall charging.",5
"This battery pack has served me well many times. I have a smart phone that depleats the battery quickly. The GTMax is a monster, it can charge my phone from completely dead to a full charge three times!! I never go anywhere with out this when I travel. My work and personal life have me glued to the phone for the most part so that played a big factor in getting one of these things. I like the fact that it also has two full sized USB ports to charge two peripherals at once.  The GTMax looks nice sleek and the three blue LED indicators tell you how far along it is from being fully charged. For the price and quality of a 5000mah battery pack, this one is a winner for me.Update: 12/16/11This battery pack still keeps on charging well and has not failed me. They rebranded the pack from a GTMax to EVOPower Black 2.",5
"For the pricing point of the device, it was an easy choice to help with my faulty cell battery. It holds a charge for weeks and comes in handy for those concerts that you want to record every second of your favorite artist&#8217;s performance! The dual usb ports allow me and a friend to recharge simultaneously. The device is easy to carry with a great starter pack of wire connections. It arrived in factory packaging in great condition. I purchased the AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Case for My Passport Essential - Black to help get around false power button press.",4
I use this at work because i dont have any other way to charge my phone. I can charge my phone twice maybe even three times from almost dead. I use it 4 days a week maybe more and its still works just the same as the day I got it.,5
"I bought this because in the few weeks since my cell phone area switched from 3G to 4G I have ended up with a completely discharged battery before dinnertime. I would nave given it 5 stars, but the 'directions' were not all that helpful and the pictures on the product page was a bit misleading. First of all, the wording on the Title of the product page stated 'charging cord' included and in the pictures there is a picture showing a regular long size charging cord but in reality there are 2 VERY much shorter spiral charging cords. As I said there were pictures with a long black charging cord and another long white charging cord and the white cord appears to be plugged into a electric socket. Neither of these cords are included and neither is the A/C plug shown in the picture for electric connection charging. Most smart phones and my Kindle Fire have the micro mini plugs BUT although I did get the 2 small spiral charging cords, I only got 1 micro mini plug. Although I have 2 USB output slots,on White Backup Recharger,I can only attach one small spiral charging cord from  phone to the Rechargeable Backup Battery Charger and I cannot use the other small spiral charging cord to power up my Kindle Fire because I don't have another micro tip to connect my Fire to the White Backup Recharger. In this case I can work with one of my electronic appliances at one time but I cannot charge up the Rechargeable Backup Charger from a wall plug if I am not close to my computer (When I am out I like the idea of being able to charge my electronics from a regular A/C plug absent a computer. I will probably buy a USB to wall plug, but I really feel that the pictures are misleading. I did use one of my other charging cords to attach the Backup Battery Charger using my computer overnight while I went through all the tips trying to locate the one supplied tip that will go with my Samsung Stratosphere. For now I am using the Micro USB to Regular USB Charging Cord to charge the Backup Charger via the computer and the small spiral USB Charging Cord with the proper tip to take with me when I go out.I know that this all sounds confusing, but that is how I felt working through this without the benefit of CLEAR instructions.I recharged my cell phone to almost full charge using the Backup Charger and I still have all 3 blue bars lit indicating that the Backup can recharge more than one time.I will edit this review after I have used this item for a while and get a feel of how good it is. Actually I am thrilled that I won't have to be paranoid anymore, praying that my cell phone will stay charged long enough to get me through the day!",4
"My friend's phone is always dying from usage so this was a complete life saver. It was a bit difficult for my friend to get used to how it works, but she is definitely grateful to have this in her purse.",4
"this is the best price for 5000mah with two 2.1a ports. the product is light. it's big but fits in your pocket (but is better to keep in you backpack and with two ports you can charge up to two device at the same time. perfect for family or help a friend. 5000mah is not much but can save you for a day (and it's not little for a compact power bank). you need to press the button to start charging and if  you press the button again, will stop charging. it do not understand why because nobody keep the devices in the cable not need the charge. and if is your backpack, something could press the button and stop charging. so, the product is not perfect, but I think deserves a 5 stars.",5
"This is the second one of these I bought. It will do three charges on my Samsung Vibrant if idle, otherwise two complete charges while listening to music and/or browsing the web over wi-fi. Not bad for $23!!! Get one already! The second one was for my wife's Blackberry Bold 9700 with a Seido Innocell 2700 mah battery, I figure two complete charges. Nice!",5
This product was great (I got a new phone so I don't use it anymore). The only set back was that I had to take my phone out of the case in order to use it in the car mount. The suction allows you to place it on any surface so I used to use it on my driver's side window so that I could hear better when the call was on speaker phone. Great product all in all.,5
"As always in Amazon, a flawless buying experience. I had some cell phone mounts before, this one really works. Is perfect for the hone, easy to use and easy to mount and dismount if necesary!",5
"I don't mean one of those spiral cords, either, I mean a 6-10ft cord that I can tuck across my dash in a subtle manner so as to position the unit on my far left, outside of my normal driving vision.  With that addition, this becomes a more compelling option for Droid X/2 owners.  As it is, the suction mount is very good and the two-piece design means I can correctly dock and power the device before anchoring it to the windshield... but so what?  For the price, not really happy but not disappointed either.-C",3
"Love this Item, It's made from strong plastic, Easy to use and you can use it even if you have a cover on your phone as you can adjust it. Would recommend it to anyone. VEry happy.",5
Fits my phone correctly. Only usable in landscape mode. Unable to view GPS in portrait mode. (phone falls out) Nice outside plug connection for constant charge.,3
"I really like the mount a lot. Even with Zagg Skin applied to the phone, it still fit in very nicely. A little snug but fit well. The suction mount works very good and been staying there for a month now. The audio cable that comes with the package does not work very good. The quality of the cable is cheaply made and a lot of static noise. I switched back to my old cable and works great.Since Android phone battery doesn't last long, this navigator mount is a great charger when I get into the car. Nowadays, I don't have to worry about bring my Garmin GPS with me since the Motorola Droid 2 phone's navigator works just as good.Also, this exact mount sells a whole lot more a Verizon store. I returned the mount back to Verizon and bought this one instead.",5
it does what its supposed to do.It works with my ipad 2 iphone 3gs.. havent tried the 4s yet.. but im sure it will work.thanks for the cheap parts.,5
I bought two of these and neither one has enough power to properly charge my phone. I have one that looks identical but is r red and has plenty of power to be useful. These have barely any power.,1
very cheap productthey drain my battery over timeone melted in my socketI have bought 3 but only use if I have to,1
Does not give out enough current to charge my Samsung Galaxy S4. I do like the size because it is small.,1
works great it is great if you are going to travel . love that has a red light that turns on to let you know it has power,5
"Bought a junky white charger and the thing fell apart on me, payed .01 for it and 1.98 shipping, so i cut my losses and tried a different one, i really like this one because the USB connection is well put together and it has a firm grip on my car when i plug it in, my white one (made by someone else) would slowly nudge loose and stop charging whatever i had plugged in, dont have to worry about that with this guy. have used it to charge my Huawei Ascend II and iPod touch 4th Gen and works great on both.",5
The red lite is on but it does not charge. Only overheats and discharge the phone. Spend a few more dollars at Walgreens and get one.,1
This product came fast and did not have any issues with this purchase.  I have not used this product yet.,3
"This charger is as advertised works as its supposes to, doe what they say it will do, hard to say much about this device other than it works  fine.",5
"Does not want to stay in car socket the whole way, needs to be more secure, but still works, have to keep pushing it in every now and then. Shorter versions stay in sockets better.",3
good product. took longer to charge a device. smaller size is convenient. NOT A cheap looking product. led is a plus,4
"These little chargers are absolutely wonderful. Their small, inexpensive and you can get them in a lot of different colors. They are very handy when you need to charge your phone for your tablet while you're driving so though be ready when you get to your destination. They also work for your tom-tom or other device that needs a USB connection. I buy a lot of them for myself and friends and customers. Their cheap enough that you can give them away as a gift. I definitely recommend this to anyone who needs to charge a device on the run.",5
"When I first got this little guy in the mail I was pretty happy with it.As others have stated, the item received was NOT the same as the item pictured, but I actually liked that.Instead of having a silver front-facing plate like in the pic, mine was all black with a single blue LED light.It worked really great too, for a few months anyway. After that it began blowing my fuse whenever I plugged it in.Granted changing fuses in a car (I have a Jeep Wrangler, so it's under the hood) is pretty simple, but after the thirdor fourth occurrence, it becomes a bit tiresome. After I used my last spare fuse I decided to purchase a new(and different) USB charger from elsewhere. That new one has been with me longer than this one ever was,and has yet to give me a singe problem.Also, I would like to add that I did take apart this USB charger after I replaced it with the new one. I figured a contact hadcome loose inside and was shorting things out, and thus blowing my fuses. I was wrong. It seems whatever was causingmy fuses to blow was due to some failed component within the unit itself. I did not care enough to poke around with myvoltage meter to find the issue, but it does look to me that my charger has some fatal design flaw, perhaps broughtout by prolonged usage (I leave mine plugged in, so it was always on when my Jeep was running). Perhaps mine wasjust a crappy unit, but it stands to reason that others out there will likely fail in the same way. Do yourself a favor andgrab a different USB charger.~Rusty",1
"I needed to charge my phone in the car because I drive between home and school a lot, works great.",5
It works great. Fits perfectly. It's worth it.......Price is so affordable. Very happy with my purchase. It came way ahead of promised date.,5
This adapter works very well for my Samsung cell phone.  I am very pleased with the quality and price. Could not be happier.,5
"I loved it and it worked great for the time that I got to use it, but it wore out in less than a year. The price was good, so I wasn't that upset about",4
"For the price you cant beat this charger. The cord only goes 3/4 the way back in after the first time use. It doesnt affect how it works, still charges the phone just fine. Its nice and light weight. It was super cheap so I am not complaining...you do get what you pay for. So far so good though.",3
"I received this product and thought it was great for the 1st week. After about 8 days, it broke and basically fell apart. I'm not hard on my charger and am very gentle plugging it in. This product is just cheaply put together.",1
"I needed a charger for my boyfriend's truck so that I wouldn't forget mine from my car when we went on trips.  I figured this would be neat since it coiled back up inside itself, however, the main reason I needed it was to charge my phone.  It does NOT charge.  It barely stays in the connection port.",1
Charge your cell phone when you're on the road. Car charger plugs into your car's cigarette lighter and charges your phone while you're driving. Use the time you spend in your car to make sure that your phone is ready to go,5
This product arrived on time as expected.  It is light weight durable and works well.  The retractable allows me to easily use my smart phone as a in car GPS.,5
"I bought this unlocked phone for use in South America.When it arrived I charged it up, inserted my existing SIM card & powered it up.Worked perfectly & connected with my carrier.It takes a little getting used to but once you know your way around it it's easy to use & operate.It doesn't have Google chat which I understand they are working on.Another need is a button to reopen pages you are surfing rather than having to try & tap them open which can be frustrating.One great benefit is that you can see Gmail in HTML mode rather than mobile mode.This opens all your folder links & helps to permanently delete SPAM.The camera & video is out of this world for a phone.We had flooding over the last week & I was able to take high quality photos & video. No need for another digital camera.All in all a great job from Nokia.Just fix the 2 small problems & I'll be even happier",5
"Let's face it, this is the best camera phone ever. You may not always bring your camera with you, but you will always have your phone with you. Then, you can always take good quality pictures any time. Nokia phones are very well made, outstanding hardware.I can't wait for the next Nokia WP7 phone.",5
"This phones main selling point is it's camera - it can take 16 x 9 photos (9 Megapixel), and can take full 12 megapixel camera that can take full resolution photos in 4:3 format. The phone integrates very well with windows. Nokia's complimentary windows app 'Nokia Suite' allows contact editing through desktop. It also allows sending text messages through desktop (when phone is connected). 'Nokia Suite' makes tethering very easy, and you can use internet both from phone and desktop.Nokia also includes inbuild GPS with voice navigation, and world maps are included standard. Voice guidance is available in many languages from around the world, or, if you like, you can make your own voice navigation.Nokia's battery lasted a bit longer when I first had it. These days it lasts about 18 hrs with an average of 3 hrs of talk time during day, and about 50-75 text messaging.The reason I have to give Nokia a 3 star is because of its recent software update Belle. This update is in all due honesty a cheap knockoff of Android. So, if you can avoid getting Belle on Nokia, it is worth 4 star atleast.Compared to what iphone offers OOTB, Nokia definitely is a strong contender.",4
"I have the phone for 6 months and I like it in general. I am on T-Mobile unlimited talk, text, data (2GB at 4G speeds then throttled) plan. N8 is not 4G but it is fast enough for what I use it for.Camera takes very good pictures in well lit conditions, but quite poor in low light ones.The stand alone GPS is a great feature and works well. I tried it both in offline and in online mode and it was good for my needs, although in the online mode the GPS locks on your location faster thanks to A-GPS and is quite a bit better at finding businesses by name. However, occasionally GPS gives strange directions that take me off the freeway and re-route me on surface streets to another freeway rather than using the interchange. It is set on the fastest route, but I don't think sometimes it selects the one.The phone has a good range of customizations and settings. The interface is quite intuitive, but you need to take some time to familiarize yourself with the menus. I think that the recent update to Belle made the phone significantly better. I have an Android tablet, so, in comparison, I was not impressed with S^3 and Anna, but Belle finally seems to provide the user experience other Operating Systems have offered for a long time.I use Swype 2.0 from betalabs dot nokia dot com. It supports Russian and other languages that the current release available at the Nokia Store does not. I use Opera Mobile for the web browser and like it better than the Nokia's one. For the book reader I use ZX Reader 2.  Initially, I used Foliantas my ereader, I liked the interface, but then noticed that on some books it occasionally did not break pages correctly (pages would repeat) and also I had to specify encoding of the TXT file, ZX Reader handles pages right and the file encoding is determined automatically.I am disappointed with the selection of the free games on Nokia Store. With Android (particularly Amazon's free app a day promo) I have hundreds of games, but with Nokia most games are demo versions or add supported and won't run without an internet connection.Also with Nokia if you get a free app and need to re-download it later, it may not be available for free anymore (Nokia support confirmed that this was the case), while with Amazon's Android Store re-downloads of the apps you own are free.Coming from BlackBerry handsets I was surprised that 'vibrate then ring' was not an option for Nokia.  In the office I do not want my phone to ring and I do not want to remember to change profiles, so BlackBerry's 'vibrate then ring' worked swimmingly for me, but N8 rings immediately when a call, a message or a calendar notification come in.  The best way to mediate this was to select the ascending ring type, but this is still not what I wanted.  Nokia has an app called  Nokia Situations that is supposed to switch profiles automatically depending on the ambiant noise I guess.  I tried this app and I have never seen my profile change from Normal (I carry my phone in the front pocket of my pants).There is a bug with the battery status on the home screen.  It jumps from full to 35% when I set the power saver mode to kick in with no indication of charge levels in between.  I installed Nokia Battery monitor and it seems to track the charge level more accurately, but it is so weird when the battery icon on the home screen looks 100% full and the Nokia Battery Monitor show 70% charge.  I hoped Belle update would fix this, but it did not.  This is the first phone I have that cannot display the battery charge level that makes sense.With N8 I have a 'loss of communication' problem with bluetooth headsets.  I have necer had this problem with any other phone. I tried different headsets (Discovery 975, Jabra Extreme, Jabra EasyGo) and they all have the problem, so it must be the phone. Basically, the phone stops responding to button presses from the headset and the audio is not routed to headset if you answer from the phone. Once the phone is rebooted, the problem goes away. This is pretty annoying because sometimes I am unable to answer a call when I am driving.The most disappointing part of the experience is Nokia's customer support. I had to contact them a few times over the last year, and every time there were issues. The support is offshore, so there is a language barrier combined with the usual 'reading of the support scripts without trying to understand the problem', constant apologizing and no resolution. The tech support was not knowledgeable, did not follow through with the resolution, I ended up solving the problem myself by reading many forums.Nokia's update to Belle went well for my N8 but caused a 'security code' error for my wife's C6-01. Apparently, according to Nokia blogs, this was an issue for many people, including some with N8. I found only one reply from Nokia's moderator in one of the blogs suggesting to keep entering any code for an unknown number of times until the phone stops asking for it. I thought this was a very unprofessional reply because first, the error should have not happened during the update, second, the solution should have been more elegant than asking users to enter random numbers hoping that one of them will eventually work (some users reported 30+ tries with no resolution), and third, what is the purpose of the security code if it can be overridden by entering incorrect codes? The solution that finally worked for me was very 'dumb'. No offence to the person who came up with it, but there should be no logical reason why this solution should have worked at all.Anyway, I bought the phone for the camera, GPS, and because I did not want to extend the contract with T-Mobile.  My memories of Nokia handsets from the 90's made me believe that Nokia N8 would be a great choice.  Unfortunately, after experiencing the modern 'Nokia' I doubt I will buy Nokia again, especially now when they switched to Windows.  With Nokia's last year's FlipSwap promos (terribly executed with rebate amounts for the same phone changing daily, and of course I jumped on the first lower rebate one) I got a good deal on my N8 ad my wife's C6-01.  Considering phones out there, I do not think N8 is worth anywhere near 400 bucks.  I believe, under $200 would be a good deal, but even then, I'd look at other options first.",3
"No HTML 5 support for location services (Twitter, 4sq and so on).  Most other mobile and desktop browsers support a version of GeoLocation, using Javascript and the DOM, this browser does not support that yet.Also being a small business owner in the past I was able to link my lotus notes contacts list to my Nokia phones.  Seems Nokia is consumer focused with this phone and will not support importing contacts list from Lotus anymore.  You have to use their OVI web site.  My N95 it just worked, now with the N8 I have to jump through a few hoops to make it work and give a copy to the OVI cloud.  Not happy about having to provide my personal contacts information to the OVI service.Last, in my humble opinion Symbian^3 seems to be better than what was on the N97 but still 'old' looking interface.  They want to keep the phone look and feel to what it has been for many years now, but take away the Lotus support they too have had for many years.  I guess they are the leader in phone OS so they get the final say.Over all not really that happy with my N8",2
"two years with the phone and still love it, glad I bought, I love ... Camera by far the best ....",5
"2012 UPDATE: Have now had the phone over a year & do not regret the purchase at all.  The Symbian Anna/Belle updates fixed the purple screen issue.  The N8 still works great: long battery life, good reception, excellent camera ... the only downside is that with Symbian on death row for 2016, the # of new apps are dwindling, so if having the latest is an issue for you, you may want to pass.  On the flip side, the price is now $100 less that what I paid making this an incredible deal for those who do not want to pay for a data plan.  The cheapest one is $20/mo so when the 2 year contract is up, you have pretty much made the $ back on the cost of phone.  Now that Nokia is switching over to Windows, which US carriers can detect & force you into a data plan, I would not hesitate to buy this phone if wifi is all you need.I have now had the phone all of 3 days when I noticed that I have the purple screen/tint issue that people have been complaining about since the N8's launch (search the web for details).  It was most notable on the unlock screen - half the clock was purple while the other half was black.  Altho the clock on the screensaver does not have this issue.Amazon's Help Section was anything but, as their directions on how to EXCHANGE sends you to the RETURN section, where exchanges are not an option.  I called & Amazon will be sending a replacement; the good news is, I do not have to return my phone immediately.  I can wait till the new N8 arrives, that way I am not phoneless.Otherwise, the N8 is great; I intended to use it more before I wrote a review but wanted to warn people that the purple issue still exists before they buy.  Some quick points: the Symbian OS is like the step-child of the mobile world but for me, & I suspect many, it works & does what it needs to do.  The build quality is superb & the phone is slimmer than I thought it would be.  So far no problems w/ the phone rebooting randomly (another common complaint).  Battery life is excellent.The reason I got this phone is bc I did not want to be forced into a data plan & so far this phone has worked great on just wi-fi.  Keep in mind that Nokia just said that they will soon stop selling unlocked phones so anyone else wanting to not be trapped into a data plan may want to buy soon.Hopefully the next phone has no issues & ships w/ Symbian Anna & not ^3 (crosses fingers). Then I will write another review or update this one w/ more details ...UPDATE: Just got the replacement phone & still the purple screen issue.  Grrrr ... !Amazon will not exchange the phone twice, they are now only offering a refund.  They got a Nokia rep on the phone with us who offered to have it fixed under warranty but that would leave me phoneless in the week or so that would take.  Neither is exactly an ideal situation (I would like to keep exchanging this brand new expensive phone until I got one that worked properly) but to Amazon's credit, they did put 'Item Under Review' on the dark gray N8 & are not selling it at all until they have a look at it ...UPDATE 2: 6 months later & now on the Belle OS update.  The phone works just fine - does what it supposed to do.  The Anna update took away the purple tint & it is still gone.  AT&T; still has not forced me into a data plan. Do not regret purchasing this phone & recommend to anyone looking for a basic smartphone or dares to be different, especially now that it is $60 less than what I paid.",5
"This is a device that requires a lot of time and energy to master. However, if your requirement is to have the capability to capture high quality images for a modest price then the Nokia N8-00 is worth considering. The user interface is not as easy to understand as iOS or even Android. The number of apps numbers in the tens of thousands.  That means there are only several hundred apps that will interest you. Basically to be happy with this handset you'll want the camera to the exclusion of all other capabilities.  It's a handset for those who can't or won't be locked into the Apple, Google, or Microsoft ecosystems.Consider that intro as my warning of 'here be monsters.' If you are adventurous then continue on:In the box you'll find a Nokia N8-00 and all the trimmings. That is to say a charger, HDMI output cable, and USB cable. And the usual safety manuals.  The Nokia N8-00 ships with Symbian^3, a 2010-era operating system with a tough interface to master and memory management problems. The only good thing about Symbian^3 is you can get rid of it.To get rid of Symbian^3 you'll need a desktop PC or laptop running Windows XP or 7, a really high speed data connection, and the latest copy of Nokia Suite (available from Nokia). Plan to download about 1 GB of data in 300 MB chunks.  Before starting your upgrade adventure, spend several hours reading the information regarding the N8-00 at [...]. You'll also have to create a Nokia account to download maps and apps. Going from Symbian^3 to Nokia Belle takes about 6-10 hours of tinkering.After installing Nokia Suite, connect the handset to the computer and let the two devices get to know each other. When the drivers are synced up you can start the software upgrade process. Nokia Suite will offer to upgrade the software from Symbian^3 to Symbian Anna. After that is completed, the next upgrade is to Nokia Belle. During the upgrade to Nokia Belle you'll see warnings forbidding you from touching the handset. Heed that warning!Getting the handset to Nokia Belle is simultaneously the beginning and end of the journey. Click on SWUpdate and download whatever remaining apps and widgets Nokia thinks you are entitled to possess on your handset. And be sure to visit the Nokia store to pick up additional apps published by Nokia (e.g. 'Internet radio').Nokia more or less abandoned Symbian/Nokia Belle in February 2011. From a user perspective this means the bugs in the handset's firmware are here to stay. You'll have to live with the bugs and quirks and work with them or around them. At one time Symbian was the most popular smartphone OS in the world. It was also the most targeted for malware. That software is still out there. You can operate the handset without an antivirus solution but depending upon your use case that might not be an acceptable mode of operation. Fortunately, anti-malware solutions are still available and maintained by their vendors.So why would anyone buy this handset in 2013? Well, besides the camera's unusual capabilities the handset can be used as a SIP phone to make VOIP calls, Nokia provides free software to listen to radio stations that stream on the Internet, the N8-00 has an FM radio, Bluetooth, and can play music via your vehicle's FM transmitter. Or, your hotel's FM radio. The HMDI output allows you to play 720p video on a television. Replacing the battery is a trivial operation.  Repairs cost about $100, so after a year if something goes wrong an out-of-warranty repair is relatively expensive. Finally, this is one of the handsets that implemented USB On-The-Go.In the end the camera is going to make or break this handset's experience for you. To see what the N8 is capable of doing in the right hands, review the YouTube videos created by topolino70.",4
i bought this like 2 years ago and still working good. I had to return it twice for repair but it's a good product and the warranty was valid back then.,4
"I've had the Nokia N8 for over a month now , and it's a great smartphone ! The negative reviews I've seen seem to come mostly either from people who are expecting an IPhone clone ( it just works ) or from people who don't know the Symbian ^3 OS .First , I should state that I'm not familiar with the IPhone, never used it , but I am familiar with Android ( MyTouch 3G Slide , G2 ) and RIM ( Blackberry Curve 8900 ) , but most of my smartphones have been Windows Mobile ( T-Mobile Dash , T-Mobile Dash 3G , HD2 ) , which may account for why Symbian ^3 seems so familiar and why I have no problem wth the occassional reboot . Now for the features ...Many people have dissed the N8 for the Symbian^3 UI  being clunky , which it is a bit . But I have no problem with it as it is very useful . As Rita El Khoury ( Google it ) put in an article , which I suggest you read  , ' Really there's nothing you can't do with Symbian once you know the drill . ' In this way , Symbian ^3 is very similar to WM .Reviewers have also slammed the Nokia browser too . It could use some improvement , but it's pretty good as is . It's a bit slower than the Google browser , though not much slower , and it does a good job with Flash , especially considering that the N8 has only FlashLite 4.1 . The rendering of pages could be better , though , and it really needs Flash 10.1 .Another sore point with reviewers is the keyboard , and they do have a few points here . The landscape QWERTY does have a rather odd key layout which does take some getting used to . Once used to it though , I find it to be a superior virtual KB . As to the the alphanumeric  portrait keyboard , I think Nokia needs to have a QWERTY option here ( Nokia , you need to take a hard look at the Opera Mobile 10.1 portrait QWERTY ; it's great !) . That said , there are situations ( logging in , for instance ) where the alphanumeric kb is useful .Camera on the N8 is terrific , no complaints ! Also love the video recording !  Not to forget that this is a superb multimedia device , great video and audio codec support ! Also love the  HDMI , though haven't used it lol , and the 3.5 mm AV port .Design on the N8 is first rate ! My only complaint here is that the battery is difficult to remove , but being able to disconnect the battery by an 8  second press on the power button does help . I like being able to access the SIM and micro SD cards from outside the phone , not to mention the hardware lock and camera buttons , fantastic ! Nor have I experienced any of the power or freezing issues reported by some users .Should you buy the Nokia N8 ? If you are willing to take the time to learn Symbian^3 , absolutely ! It'ss well worth the trouble and the N8  is a wonderful smartphone ! And don't forget the USB On -the - Go !Edit *****I've had my N8  for 6 months now and it's still awesome ! Here are my thoughts at 6 months .First , I should state that I'm a power user ; I use my n8 a lot , so some of the issues  I report may not be important to you and vice versa . Firdt the cons ...Proably the most annoying is that occassionally , the data connection won't engage when it should . This only happens every once in a while , but it requires  reboot , rather irritating . Nokia should really fix this IMHO .The second most annoying issue is that once in a while , the email client will stop downloading emaild for several hours .It always starts up again , and it's more of a nuisance than an issue for me , but for people who need reliable email , this woulf be an issue .Third is the new  Ovi Store , it does weird thing . U can't contact support , the emails don't go through . If u have a long list  after the first 10 items , the others display for a few seconds then disppear . The  IM for Nokia app doesn't update or install correctly . Nokia , pleaseee fixr these issues .Unlike many other N8 owners apparently , I use the Nokia browser as my chief browser . It's a great browser , just needs full Flash , better standard support !Finally , I still haven't really experienced the freezing and restart that some r reporting , other than the ones common to computers  e.g.  u have many windows open or the servers r messing up , things like that , but these r normal !One last thing , Nokia really needd to take better care of their current customers by getting the updates outrather sooner ,the new N8s have been shipping with the Anna update for almost 2 months now  yet current n8 users still don't have it !But I must ssy , the N8 is STILL  an awedome smartphone ,and I still highly recommend it !!!update 3-22-2012this is my third N8 but that`s no reflection on Nokia ; the original one was one of the infamous first batch, which had issues , just one of those things ; the second I downloaded a bad app ( cough , norton Smartphone Security , cough ) and it fried the software . Current one , no problems !One other thing , I DEFINITELY  reccommmend the Belle update , it makes the N8 even more awesome !One last thing lol . The issues I reported earlier have been fixed by the Belle update , woo hoo!!!!",5
"excelent, i use it everywhere i go oversea plus it's unlocked and easy to set up wonderful apps and maps.",5
"Had this phone for over 3 weeks but just had to return it. Let me tell you this phone has a great quality build and great spec's. The overall hardware is incomparable and really stands out in comparison to that of the competition. The 12 megapixel camera takes outstanding pictures and can easily replace a 'point and shoot' camera.. Honestly the phone is an honest good buy but the Symbian OS ruines the whole user experience.I have been an avid Nokia user since the release of the Nokia N95. From there on I have owned the N82, N86 and jumped to the N900 last year. After being spoiled using the Maemo OS found in the N900 I honestly hoped that the Symbian's OS update would catch up and even exceed Maemo which has now evolved into MeeGo thanks to it's partnership with Intel. Sadly Symbian stays way behind and I found myself wanting to throw the phone across the room at times due to the various frustrations it caused.Constant freezing, long wait time, and constant clicking from one thing to another just to get a task done. I love you Nokia but Android and Apple's iOs have left you behind. I'm only hoping that Nokia's next flagship phone has MeeGo OS as it's software platform and maybe I'll jump back and be the happy customer I once was when owning a Nokia device.Overall if your looking to own a phone with excellent call quality, outstanding hardware/build and looking to replace your 'point and shoot' camera with a phone then go ahead and make your purchase. But if your out looking for a great overall Smartphone then I recommend you look away from anything running Symbian.",3
"You are no doubt interested in this phone for it's camera - after all, it's really the only good reason to struggle with Symbian in 2012.  I have owned this phone and while I like it, I'd recommend sitting this one out and ordering a Nokia 808 PureView.  It has a 41-mp camera, which is completely ground-breaking for a phone.Nothing wrong with this and at $299, it's a bargain, but I'd recommend doubling that and getting the 808 once Amazon offers it.  Just some (sound) advice from a S60 fan.",3
"I've been using the Nokia N-8 for a full four months now.  I love my phone.  It is sturdy, holds a charge well, and has plenty of cool smartphone features.  I especially like the Favorites Widget that places pictures of my Favorite contacts on the home screen, allows my to swipe through them, and then access either their phone, messaging or email.  Voice commands through an app/widget is good as well.  I love that I could load it with memory (16 internal and a 32gb micro sd that I added) for a total of 48gb.  That's allowed me to put almost all of my music on the phone (in 256kb quality) and still have lots of room for pictures, documents, apps and full applications.The radio transmitter works well for me in a Mazda Miata... but your mileage may vary and it may not work in all cars (it doesn't seem to in a Honda Pilot, for example).  Bluetooth is excellent in all vehicles I've been in or in home applications.Limitations:  No Chase or Bank of America apps.  No app for Audible.  I use an Ipod Touch for these functions, so I can live with this but I would like Audible (hint to Nokia and Audible)Nice touches:  Pictures are excellent and with the photo apps you can even enhance those functions and add neat photo effects.Body of phone is sleek and when used as is slips nicely into a guy's back pocket or shirt pocket.  Maps/guidance is fully functional.  Opera Mini Web browser is a fine app, particularly when no WiFi is available.  Search widget allows you to search either the phone or the Internet right from one of the  home pages you can design with the latest Symbian OS.",5
Really nice phone more than he expected for that price love it and that is all that I have to say about this product!,5
"I have been a Nokia user for years, owning a number of their Symbian phones (N75-3, N95-3, E71-2, E72-2, N97-3). I was eager to get this because it appeared as if it was Symbian 5th (S^1) done correctly which is what I was looking for, not to mention the camera really sucked me in. It's been a month and a half since I began using this as my primary device, and I've spent considerable time using it and comparing it to my N97 and Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S).Overall, the N8 doesn't appear to me to be a completely finished product software wise. While comparing it to my N97, I noticed that a number of features that I found very to be useful and loved were gone, like the customizable equalizer in the music player (I'm hoping Nokia gives it back to us in the next firmware update), and the GPS Data application that we always had. Still, there were other things that made me wonder what the software developers were doing during the testing phase of Symbian^3, like how there's no way to send an MMS message that gets stuck in your Outbox, or how there's no menu option to add a song to a playlist from the Now Playing screen like there was in S^1. There are plenty of other examples I can give as well, not to mention all the inconsistencies across the UI. But it's not all bad. In fact there's a lot to like about it.Here's what I liked about it:The camera is fantastic but it will take some time to really master it. Nevertheless its really easy to take a very good quick shot of something, and did I mention how real the coloring is? The days of fake reds and yellows are gone. Video recording is very good. It may not be quite as smooth as the iPhone 4, but there's no overexposure problems, coloring is real, and the audio is by far the best on the market. You can edit your photos and videos right on the phone, unlike with my Captivate, and thank you Nokia for still putting a very good camera button on the side of the phone unlike some other phone makers who don't have one at all (I can't stand that about a lot of Android phones). Reception is typical Nokia aka top notch, and phone calls are crystal clear. I love Nokia's Profile's that allow you to personalize your ringers and tones, and create and customize your own so you can have different ones for different times of the day. Build quality is very good; the best next to the E71. HDMI will actually display the whole UI on your TV unlike certain Android phones which only display your videos. It has a microSD card slot that's easily accessible and USB OTG which allows you to connect any FAT32 formatted flash drive to the phone which is really cool. Finally we have multiple homescreens on Symbian, and you can still create folders in the application menu to organize all your apps just like we've always been able to do. I love the home key that doubles as a notification light and I'm glad its a physical key. Ovi Sync which backs up your contacts, calendar and notes to a server is great. Ovi Maps (v3.06 which does not come with the phone because it's still in beta but has multitouch) is really good. The GPS on this is the best I have ever seen. The single speaker is actually pretty loud (though my N95-3 still sounds louder). Finally we have threaded SMS although it's not done properly. Video playback is very good and it has a long list of formats that will work. The music player UI looks good but is missing key features that were there in my N97 that I always used. However, I really like how disconnecting your headphones while music is playing pauses the song. Also, the volume seems to have more intervals than in previous Nokia's. I like how this isn't always connected via a data connection like a lot of Android devices (My Captivate eats through data because so many apps are constantly downloading information, like Facebook, Twitter, Weather apps, etc). Haptic feedback is really good, and at times you will really think you're actually pressing a real button. Love how it has a front facing camera unlike practically everything you get today from the carriers (thank you unlocked phone market). Love the screen saver that shows the time and any notifications. The battery will get you through the day as long as you aren't syncing email at all times during the day or running any homescreen widgets all the time like Accuweather. I was pleasantly surprised about that, although, if you're going out on Friday night and you did a lot of web browsing during the day, charge it before you go out. Ovi Suite, as much as it still needs work, is really nice to have since you can use it to back up your phone data and download maps to your phone for Ovi Maps. I love how the phone can connect to your computer as a storage device and NOT have to be used through a specific software like iTunes. I like how you can set any song you have as a ringtone, and you can do this through the music player too (again thanks to it being unlocked). The email client has a great implementation of pinch to zoom unlike the Gmail client on my Captivate which has none or the email application on it, which does a poor job of it. Leave it to Nokia to give you multitasking without rules or limits, and I like the familiar Symbian feel it still has to it.What I didn't like:There is no customizable equalizer to fine tune the sound in the music player (only presets that don't do much of anything). The non-removable battery, no matter what you try and tell me, will always be something I don't like. Don't bother using red-eye reduction before taking a photo because it just makes the subjects' eyes look weird. Just edit the photo afterwards. I personally find the 3.5' display to be a little too narrow (a 3.7' would have been better. There are no stereo speakers like on previous Nseries. There's a number of missing menu options that should otherwise be there, the settings menu needs to be restructured badly, and there are too many UI inconsistencies. The Facebook and Twitter apps are terrible compared to ones you get on Android. There is no portrait QWERTY, the landscape QWERTY is not designed like it should be (like the ones on Android, iOS), and the current keyboard takes up the entire display. Certain aspects of the UI are too small to be finger friendly. I find the homescreen switch button to be pointless and think it should be a customizable shortcut instead. The email client is slow and does not display HTML correctly all the time. 256MB of RAM is acceptable but 512MB of RAM would have been much better for every type of user. But I do push this phone hard. Kinetic scrolling speed is not consistent across the UI. In some applications a quick flick will give you a fast scroll, and in other applications it will give you a medium pace scroll. The phone is slower than it should be at times, like when browsing through your loaded SMS Inbox, and when Ovi Sync is running. There are the unnecessary annoying connection notifications which I can't stand, and I don't like how tapping on a link in a text message results in a pop-up instead of simply opening the link. The web browser needs at lot of work UI and page loading wise. I'm still getting all those (you are now leaving a secure website...) prompts when I just want to get to my web page. There is a slight hesitation on the first pinch to zoom in the photo gallery. Only 3 homescreens while Android has 7. The camera UI needs work, and by work, I mean completely redone. No LED flash means no flashlight/video light. There's no touch to focus in the camera for stills or video recording, and you will be cleaning the camera lens a lot. The number of apps available for the U.S. market is a joke compared to Android and iOS's app catalog. Smart dialing only looks for names instead of both names and numbers.As much as I really wanted to love this phone, I can't because of the software and all the things that were left out. Until the software gets updated and the UI gets redone, and all the things that are missing get put back in, I can only give this 3 stars overall, even though it definitely has the potential to get 5. Don't get me wrong, I like this phone, and I'm going to keep it, but I'm not completely happy with it yet. Maybe in January I will be. As far as recommending this, it's the best choice if you want a camera phone, but until the app store starts getting the top 100 apps in the Android Market and iTunes App Store, I really can't recommend this to anyone in the U.S. market who just wants a nice smartphone.For those who have Nokia phones, and are looking at getting this, it's better than anything else Nokia has offered at this point. But that's really not saying much. Symbian^3 is good, but not where it needs to be. Thankfully, there is an update planned for Q1 next year that will bring a lot of changes, but only a few which are known at this point, like the portrait QWERTY. I would wait until that update comes, and then make your decision. Also, there is a second update planned for Q3 next year where the UI will be redone.For those who have Android devices or an iPhone, I highly doubt that you'll like Symbian as it is now. In fact, I know you won't since I also own the Captivate. UI wise it's a step backwards and the app store doesn't have anywhere near the number of U.S. centric apps the other two platforms have. Unless you really want a great camera/media device/phone, I really think that you'll be more disappointed with this than anything, even with all the little things the N8 can do that others can't. Maybe after the upcoming software update, it might be more appealing, but again, if you want apps, there aren't that many good ones. Try it for yourself though. Maybe you'll like it.",3
"I used to buy Nokia phones because they were resilient, reliable, and seemed to have good quality control.No more.I spent a hefty amount on this phone. It worked for the first three months, but then I moved abroad (to Ghana) and it suddenly froze. It hasn't worked since. I bought an X2 but the camera was awful, so I bought a C-3. The C-3 began breaking into pieces, literally.Nokia has fallen behind in the mobile phone market, and it seems they have gotten rid of quality control to save costs. What a shame, because all those years ago when I traveled internationally, Nokia was a reliable phone to have.",1
"Best features for the price, excellent screen and a good camera replacement. Symbian 3 is a really good update to Symbian 5th. Another good thing is the FM transcriber so you can play the music in any radio. Good audio quality.USB on the go so you can connect any USB drive and also you get an HDMI port to.You get also a gorilla glass screen so you can put your phone with your keys and your screen will be perfect.The best phone i ever used in my life.Get it now if you want a really good smartphone.Tip: You can connect a USB mouse and keyboard to your N8, if you connect your phone to your TV you get almost a netbook computer.Good job Nokia.",5

"I used this phone for over a year. This replaced another Nokia (that I no longer remember the model number to). This phone has 1 feature that is only present in a handful of phones in the world!!!This phone will broadcast to an FM frequency of your choosing directly. This phone has a built in FM transducer!The Nabigation was awesome, the apps were great. Nokia just did not make it future proof enough and the symbian OS is quite dated. The screen was big enough to watch videos, make calls but not for imersive gaming. Battery life was quite good and the screen's colors were awesome.12 MP camera blows most current phones out of the water.Voice quality was the best I've heard of any phone I've had for the last 5 years. Including the samsungs.The exterior was beautiful, brushed aluminum finish in GREEN! Loved it, upgraded to an SIII after I could not keep defending the Symbian OS anymore as android had killed everything else.Still if you're on a budget or traveling abroad and can't get your phone unlocked, this is a great phone to have.",5
"I've used Nokia smartphones for awhile now starting with the E63. This is the first N series I have used. I also use a Google Nexus One and thought I would leave Nokia behind. I decided to replace my E72 (my work phone)with another hardware qwerty phone but AT&T really didn't have a suitable replacement. Where I work, AT&T has the strongest and most reliable signal. I was planning on waiting for the Nokia E7 but the price was a bit much. I took the plunge and ordered the N8 back in February thinking I could return it if I didn't like it. When I received the phone I was surprised at how good it looked. The press and blog photos don't do this phone justice, it is a sleek and handsome phone.The build quality puts most other phones to shame. Set up was straight forward and easy. I was up and running in minutes. I use Nokia's ovi service and synced my contacts and everything OTA. Nokia did a great job with symbian^3. It is fluid, fast and intuitive. There is a slight learning curve if you are not used to symbian but I experienced a similar learning curve with android. This is a big step up from symbian 1. The camera is great as the reviews have said. I thought I would miss the hardware keyboard but I found myself typing just as fast on the (according to the tech blogs) 'substandard' on screen qwerty. I couldn't understand this because I struggled with the Nexus One even with swiftkey. The reason for this I think is that Nokia's touch screen is of a higher quality and thus more accurate than the N1.I installed swype and I love it. The only thing I miss (being a USA user) are local apps. No apps for programing my dvr etc. Nokia has released things like 'Sleeping Screen' and other useful apps for this phone and a large UI upgrade is in store for summer. This phone has pushed aside my Nexus as my main phone.",5
"This phone has some incredible features at this unlocked, off contract price.  This is a 3G pentaband WORLD phone which will work on both AT&T and T-Mobile. It has a 12MP camera with a CCD sensor 3 times bigger than iPhone 4 and even larger than purpose built high quality camera's like the Panasonic LUMIX ZS-3.  It has a Xenon flash for excellent night time shots.  The N8 shoots HD 720p with HDMI and DOLBY Surround sound output!  The camera's optics are specially designed and made by Carl Zeiss, and it has AutoFocus and a mechanical shutter for big camera capabilities in a compact form factor.  The phones body is a single piece of Anodized, scratch resistant Aluminum, with Gorilla glass front.  It has a new generation AMOLED display with anti-reflective layer.  The N8 also sports BLuetooth 3.0, so you can use a wireless bluetooth keyboard and mouse simultaneously.  It also has USB on-the-go, so you can directly use mass storage devices like a hard drive or USB flash memory.  The phone has the latest Symbian^3 OS, with multi-touch, actual multi-tasking and avoids the double tapping of older Symbian versions.  The software also includes on-board and robust photo and video editing.  The N8 also uses a faster GPU than the iPhone 4 (SOC GPU), called the Broadcom BMC2727, for a great gaming experience which you can also pipe directly to an HD TV and play on the big screen.  It also comes with free turn by turn navigation, available in 74 countries. Of course, its a Nokia so Video Call capability is a given.  Battery life is exceptional.",5
"I bought the Nokia N8 for my mom for Christmas because it had all the things she wanted (touch screen phone, smart phone, mp3 player, and to combine devices such as her excellent camera). Alas, she didn't want it (likes her simple flip better, easier to hold, and she doesn't like touch screen for a phone, just for an mp3 player)But ....I DIG it. It is smaller than the E7, which is a beast in comparison. Camera is amazing, flash blinding.Other awesome factors:! HDMI out! USB on the goFM transmitter - so simple, but so so convenientstorage &lt;- 16gb built in + 32gb on microsd = 48gb (plus usb)Data access is very controllable. Maps can update via sms (or network, or simple unassisted GPS). You can set priority of data access to favor wifi, or whatever priority for many access points (wifi, 3g, network, etc). Manage data. Cool. I say, get this phone, and go for a cheap GSM plan.Notes:1. came with Symbian^3, but not Anna. Anna makes the difference. If Anna hadn't updated, I would definitely have returned it. Lusting for Belle.2. camera protector - it ships with a camera protector for shipping. Remove this thing or your photos will be super hazy.Get these apps:Nokia apps: Situations, Panorama, PlayTo, Here and Now, Big Screen, Reader (but, don't subscribe to too much it will drive you crazy if a widget), Map, Drive, Places (pretty cool)Noka beta apps: Live View (frikkin awesome)3rd party, best: Fring (forward facing camera, google voice integration, etc, second favorite 3rd party), Opera Mini or Mobile (favorite 3rd party app), Wordpress3rd party, non-Ovi: Books (from Meego project, not sure who the developer is)It's kind of slippery. I think anyone who gets it will have to get some kind of protector case.Drat:1) I haven't found a way to turn on the camera flash as a flashlight like my E7 (and pretty much all my other old Nokes handsets would) will do (hold screen lock for like 5 sec till it comes on/off)2) no Kindle app3) no Netflix of Hulu4) no Meego :( why Nokia why? so sad (tho Anna is good)BELLE UPDATE;Belle is very pretty. It seems to improve performance (speed). Books (which I previously got from Meego site) now appears in the updated Nokia Store. Nokia Live View (beta app) is now Nokia City Scape.UPDATE (2012-0610):Still love the phone after 6 mo.Why? Several reasons.Amazing camera.Lots of photo & music/sound editing capability onboard (with each Symbian version), gps voice navigation the same quality as a stand alone unit (this alone makes it worth the purchase), FM extras (radio and radio out). Also, the autocorrect/predictive text is better than my ipod touch, by several orders of magnitude, which really surprises me. Also like the large onboard and very large expandable memory. And HDMI out. And built in backup options.Perpetual annoyances: not Meego (so sad so sad), no Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Video, no Kindle app. There are ways to Get Around each of these annoyances, but, well, if it had Meego there would be no need. Hoping Nokia/Accenture merges Meego with the goodies of the other open source platforms (WebOS & Meego/Tizen) and resurrects in house OS. But not holding my breath on that one. Also, strangely, the phone likes to spontaneously reboot; is this due to my carrier (TMo)? full phone memory? What's that about? I have the feeling it may be carrier related, but again, no bets there.I've got a family plan, with an ancient data plan which is very cheap. And in this case, there are very few options out there with better value (than using this unlocked user-controlled phone).",5
"Simply put...amazing.  Fantastic camera, shoots 720p HD video, HDMI output, 16GB storage capacity with MicroSD slot, can plug a mouse or USB thumb drive into it.  I updated the phone's software from Anna to Belle and it gave the phone a much more modern/sleek look and feel. Can't rave enough about how great this phone is...especially with a 32GB Class 10 MicroSD card.NOTE: It can get a little sluggish if you have over 2000 text messages or have 'Theme Effects' turned on.",5
Wow! Just a few days using this phone and all I can say is that this is the best phone I've ever had. Nokia deserves 5 stars! This phone has all the features needed and more... I have no complains about this excellent piece of technology. Totally recommended!,5
"I had been on the fence to purchase the last of Nokia's flagship Symbian powered phones for a long time...but finally made the plunge.  Coming from a long line of Nokia products, I was fully prepared for some of the typical Nokia glitches/characteristics.  The N8 has a phenomenal camera, which I used extensively.  However, after sampling an Android OS smartphone, I felt a bit cheated (read: jealous) that such as powerful, high quality device like the N8 didn't have certain applications or support from its software developers.  Nokia's OVI store has come a long way from my previous E50 and E71, but at the end of the day, I felt like something was missing.  Most touch screen phones are usually easy to operate, but this one required far more (and almost unnecessary) key strokes and steps to accomplish every task, that it became exhausting to do anything.  Previous Symbian powered devices run circles around it with their old school hardware keys.  I did not experience any of the shut downs or problems may others did.  Conversely, this had so many great Nokia features and hardware I hated to return it because I'm such a Nokia fan...but with the recent withdrawal of Nokia from the US market I felt abandoned as a long term customer.Likes: excellent camera, alarm clock that works even if you power the phone off, built in OVI maps (not reliant upon the buggy network carrier), battery life, screen resolution and build quality.Dislikes: cost, lack of popular applications available for download, buggy processor at times, and extremely difficult data input method.If the E7 would have the N8's camera, or the N8 the E7's keyboard I suspect it would've been easier to live with.",3
"I love the camera, takes great photos, the flash is functional. The navigation achieves satellite lock within a minute, even without a data plan. The maps are fairly recent (current is end of april 2012), and the traffic rerouting works.The battery cannot last the whole day on standby if 3G is enabled, so I am forced to leave phone in 2G mode. Nokia does not care about Symbian, so Belle Refresh is not yet available for US N8's, even though international N8 got it almost as soon as it was released in Aug 2012. This is still a good unlocked phone, but I wish Nokia would support it better.Also, for any warranty repair, the phone has to be shipped back to Nokia, and they will take the full 10 business days before even attempting to contact you and shipping it back. I sent the phone in for battery life dropping rapidly, had to wait almost three weeks to get phone back. (and since Nokia did not have grey in stock for replacement phone, I had to get an orange)",4
"Compre 5, de los cuales 1 o 2 tienes problemas con la bateria, resulkta que se apagan sin razon y no los puedes volver a prender a menos que los lleves a servicio tecnico y cambies la bateria o le hagas un 'chispazo' mal mal,,Somos MioArt.Org",3
"The nokia N8 is a great phone, the best part about it is that you do't need to carry around a camera with you everywhere you go, everything you need for photos is within one place. thanks PUT group, you've made my day. For a guaranteed phone PUT group is the best place to buy it. Nice doing business with u",5
"Hi people,Im Carlos from Dominican Republic. I used to be a fan of Windows Mobile a few years ago and then about 2 years ago turned Android.While must of the companies are developing or focus on great phones with fast processors, bigger and vivid screens, which one will integrate NCF?, fingerprint reader, getting app update twice a month or a lot of customROMS to flash like a maniac looking for the best performance... Me, ...tired of that life style, prepare myself for something new.I had a really bad and annoying experience with a Nokia 5800 :S It looks so FAT, screen sucks and feel so plastic! Besides that, the Symbian it uses fed me up. The menu or process for doing anything is maddening. It ask for everything. Makes me feel stupid.I did a very detailed research of this device before I placed my order. I read every single review on amazon and from other websites. At first, I was REALLY scare of the Sleep Of Dead [SOD] that happens on some units but I assume de risk and hope not to use the 'return' option.Here are my POSSITIVE impressions of the Nokia N8:+ Penta Band 3G: Wherever I go, USA, Europe, Caribbean I'll have 3G access! That's cool.+ AMOLED screen: Looks great and it's nice to know that it has gorilla scratch resistant. Of course iF4 and must of Android devices has better graphics.+ Housing/Design: Perfect! The aluminium finish, nice material and the silver color makes a great balance.+ Camera/Xenon Flash: Much better than all Windows Mobile, Android that I've used. I cant compare to iphone4 since I haven't use it.+ FM Radio wRDS and Transmitter: Nowadays it's not common to listen FM stations but I've found the FM Transmitter very useful! The only issue is that must be really close to the radio in order to work better.+ Signal: Great. I've experience this talking volume in Blackberry devices. The sound is adequate.+ Battery: Great so far :D Gives more than a day. With Android devices battery last 6-12hrs...+ USB On the Go: Havent test it but It's really cool to know It's on your device!+ HDMI: Havent test it but It's really cool to know It's on your device!NEGATIVE Impressions from other REVIEWS and my fixes:- Virtual Keyboard: Yes, it's bad at first. Need some time to get used to it but It's good using Spanish language. We'll have an update soon, so, we hope Nokia do something with this! There is also another keyboard called 'DAYHAND' just google it... It seems that is not available any more.- Browser: IT REALLY SUCKS!!! Try Opera and use Opera Link to have your Favorite websites linked.- No OFFICE Documents Edit: Yes, This was fixed with an update... Anyways I don't use it.- Video Recording has no light: So? Some other devices don't have it either... Im so satisfied with the Xenon that I don't really care of LED.- Battery is not User friendly replaceable: So?!?!?! With Symbian there is no need of flash-a-holic and do some crazy app installations. Just press the power button for a few seconds and I'll restart.- Poor Application Store: It's right, it's not the best. But must of the application I use are available. Too bad Developers are not motivated :(- GPS: I can't use OVI MAPS in my country. Looking for google maps for Symbian...EXPECTATIONS1) Announcement of the next update with fixes of all software issued including new keyboard!.2) Hope my N8 dont DIE!!! I wouldnt like to start a return-waiting process.Well, That's all folks. Sorry for my extended review.Oh! Last thing: Don't forget to buy the otterbox to protect this little toy :D",5
"Can't beat it for all in one device, especially if a camera is important. Video quality is good as well. Navigation is good. Included accessories are great. You can actually connect this to TV via HDMI with included cables. Battery life exceeds most devices I've used. Email works well.I have a DSLR. The camera is not as good of course, but pictures matter to me and I will take and print pictures using this camera. With other camera phones I think 'what's the point?' and don't bother. I leave my DSLR at home unless I want to get creative.",5
"For this amazing price, the HTC Desire was the android comparison I looked at before I purchased the N8. So much bashing has taken place concerning Nokia's symbian - but mainly from 'review sites'. Actual owners hardly have anything negative to say. Having used both, I cant say which one is 'better' as there are pros and cons to each, and each person has their own preference. Like other decisions, this one involves trade offs that the buyer must make. I chose the N8 because: Solid construction, gorilla glass, 12MP camera, HD video, FM transmitter, HDMI & TV out, 16GB storage, bluetooth 3.0, Nokia legendary reliability and the battery last days (not hours). If you are willing to forgo all these for the android experience, that's personal preference. In my opinion a pretty UI is not everything and Symbian ^3 is fast and responsive! Bottom line is the N8 is value for money (the camera alone is worth the price!). Just one more point for those who may have an 'issue' with their phone - TRY UPDATING THE FIRMWARE!",5
"I saw many bias reviews about this phone, some only pointed out the good, some only pointed out the bad. I am not.Pro: Good call quality, superb reception over other brands, great camera, the first penta-band(850/900/1700/1900/2100) 3G bandwidths which is 'unique'!Con: The calls hang up when you put the phone next to your ear, touch screen is not responsive for some applications, lag in some applications, the 3.5' screen is smaller compared to other 3.5' screens, the camera button is too firm to pressI don't complain about the lack of various applications for Symbian^3 as I don't need a lot of applications. But the bugs of the phone kill it.PS. Heard the first software update is coming in January. Hope it will fix all the problems and I will fall in love with it again!",4
"The N8 is my second Nokia phone, after the E71. Granted, I'm finding it challenging to move from the E71's QWERTY keyboard to the virtual keyboard on the N8. But, the challenges don't end there. Let me back up and say, first off, both that I really wanted to love the N8 and also that its hardware gives a lot to be loved.The phone feels great in the hand. The camera is all you've probably heard about, and more (plus, third party developers are now releasing apps that really unleash the camera's capabilities to the amateur photographer). Battery life is pretty good - not exceptional, but really good for a smart phone. I use this phone a lot and only occasionally have I had to put it on a USB or car charger, in the late afternoon. 3.5MM headphone jack is welcome. MicroSDHC slot puts the N8 ahead of the E7, in my opinion. Despite the modest clock speed of its CPU, I rarely experience sluggish behavior from this phone.Personally, I think Microsoft made a good move, in their alliance with Nokia; this phone proves Nokia's hardware is among the top of smart phones available today. The WindowsPhone OS can only go up, whereas I've about given up hope that Nokia's software development will ever improve. While Symbian^3 is a significant improvement over particularly the touchscreen capabilities of its Symbian predecessors, Nokia is not breaking any land-speed records with it's OS development cycle. Integration with PC-and cloud-based calendar, contacts, tasks, and other apps is really bad. Nokia's decision to prohibit the newest versions of Nokia PC Suite from syncing with the N8 - forcing N8 users to rely upon the awful and fatally buggy Nokia Ovi Suite - frankly illustrates some arrogant disregard Nokia holds for its customer base. Nokia Ovi Suite is but one reason why Nokia is failing in the market for higher-end phones. Perhaps Microsoft can help shore up Nokia's fortunes in this area; it's hard to imagine the alliance with Microsoft making the software situation with Nokia much worse.Both the portrait and landscape keyboards are finicky; even Swype (while a big improvement over the delivered landscape keyboard) lags behind Android and iOS keyboards. Third party developers, such as mobileways.de, which develop the excellent Twitter app, 'Gravity,' have proven keyboard design can be much better, on Symbian (in fact, Gravity proves there's much that can be done with the entire Symbian UI, if Nokia only applied itself).Nokia continues to only partially implement significant enhancements - it allows users to designate an alternate browser, as the default, then never calls the default browser; only using its lackluster native browser (although update PR2.0, expected in March or April, 2011, is expected to produce an improved browser). Particularly if Opera Mobile adds pinch-to-zoom, I expect even Nokia's updated browser will find itself not listed as most user's default web browsers. Symbian^3 allows for multiple calendars to be created, but there's no way to accept appointments received as iCal files attached to emails into one specific calendar; they only go to the default and have to be manually moved to another calendar, if desired. Symbian still has no notion of 'categories' for appointments, tasks, contacts, or as a file attribute (a feature the Palm OS had, more than a decade ago). Don't expect to sync categories from Outlook, for example, to your Nokia phone. The calendar on the N8 is the worst calendar I've ever seen on a smart phone. No agenda view; no way to exclude tasks from what few views offered; an awful month-at-a-glance view. . . the calendar on the N8 is a real step backwards, even when compared to the old E71. Here again is an example where the WindowsPhone OS can only produce better functionality. It is astonishing to me that, even now, no third party developer has released a calendar app that beats the awful calendar shipped on the N8.As of this writing, there is no ereader app available for commercial ebook formats such as the Kindle, eReader.com, MobiPocket, or Nook. This is but one example of the considerable disregard of the Symbian^3 OS held by the commercial developer marketplace. I fear this is one area where the Microsoft alliance will pose a challenge; will developers continue to work with Symbian, even after the phone is updated to Symbian^4, with the possibility the WP OS will spell the future for high-end Nokia phones?Nokia continues efforts at developing innovative new apps, through its Beta Labs, but it is not rolling out needed updates to basic products such as Nokia Ovi Suite, fast enough.There are some things Symbian^3 does do very well. It's multitasking capabilities and memory management are head-and-shoulders above other mobile OS', in my opinion. While Nokia has implemented copy-and-paste relatively poorly, in the N8, that feature and many others are available. Ovi Maps is one standout application that ships with the phone (and its turn-by-turn navigation is a real value-added feature to this phone). The music app isn't half bad (but, Nokia, why do you make it possible for me to edit photos and video directly on the phone, but make it impossible to edit MP3 tags?) and the video playback is very good, whether on the phone or using its HDMI output.I could go on, but I should probably instead get to the bottom line: Do I recommend this phone? Yes and No. If you are already familiar with Symbian - the good and the bad - then you'll probably find a lot to like, in the N8. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in tinkering with your phone, you might want to seriously consider the iPhone, one of the many Android phones or (for those of you looking for a business-oriented phone) a Blackberry. Every week or two, I debate about whether I'm going to sell my N8 and return to the trusty E71; if you go with the N8, you need to do so after looking at both the good and the bad. And maybe PR2.0 and the other promised updates in 2011 actually will improve the prospects for this Symbian device. At least, that is, until Nokia's phones sporting the WindowsPhone - Nokia style - start to hit the street.",4
"this is my second Nokia, first one i had was N72....needed some other phone after my Samsung Galaxy.... thought to give it a shot....really good phone....so far no problems that i am concerned abt.....Nokia is a good and trusted company.... the only thing i wish if they also had google market instead of ovi.... but so far not having any complaints....phone is working fine and have lots of app. also ordered the sd card for extra memory....it do takes a lot of time to transfer any movies in the phone....as it converts and transfer....don't have much to say now for the phone....will probably update after a while abt it.....UPDATE SEPT. 26 2012SO, IT'S ALMOST 2 MONTHS SINCE I HAD THIS PHONE. THE BEST FEATURE OF THE PHONE IS THE CAMERA. 12MP & CLARITY IS AWESOME, U DON'T NEED ANYTHING WHEN YOU HAVE THIS.BUT LAST FEW DAYS I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS AS IT WASN'T ACCEPTING SIM CARD. I DON'T HAVE A CLUE ON EARTH WHY OR WHAT WAS THE REASON. I JUST TRADE IN WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY S II.PLUS N8 FREEZES A LOT WHILE DOING SOMETHING. IT WAS JUST GETTING ME PISSED OFF BUT I HAD TO STAY CALM ON THAT PART.WELL GOOD LUCK GUYS WITH THAT ONE CUZ WHAT OTHER THING I HEARD THAT NOKIA IS NOT GOOD IN MAKING SMART PHONES. I LOVED THEIR N72 THO.N8 FOR ME, LASTED JUST AROUND 2 MONTHS.",3
"i had the nokia 5800 before i bought the nokia n8. i would say the nokia n8 is an improved version of the nokia n8. slightly larger screen, capacitive instead of resistive, better cpu and a much better camera.the capacitive screen is a great improvement over the resistive screen of the 5800. the amoled screen is also much better and i love it. looks decent enough in sunlight though not direct sunlight. great responsiveness though the OS itself can lag on occasion. nothing serious.the keyboard is terrible. doesnt allow multiple fingers touching at the same time so that if you press 'e' and while pressing 'e' you press 'f' and then let go, only the 'e' appears on screen so you must type each letter with one touch and one touch only. a drag. still, responsiveness of touchscreen and predictive T9 can be a nice enough substitute. also no portrait qwerty keyboard yet.music is much like on the 5800, which in my opinion, lacks. looks nicer but still in essence the same as the 5800.video is very good. you can play most formats up to 720p resolution but some h.264 files do not play. this was somewhat a disappointment. you can convert the files but one of the reasons i wanted this device over the 5800 is that i would not have to convert anymore. still, most files do play and very nicely. also the HDMI 720p output is very nice and is also one of the reasons this device stands out (though output is for video and images only i think). a playlist for video files would have been a nice feature that is missing.call quality is nokia's standard, which is very good. SMS looks good though again, the lousy on screen keyboard tarnishes the experience.battery life: i do not use 3G. just wifi. the battery lasts a day with some inet surfing and light gaming. i am mostly pleased with battery though it is a shame it is not user replaceable. a minor thing.apps: not what i got the nokia 8 for but still, i went to the ovi store and downloaded quite a few apps. some games (angry birds and fruit ninja and some other games) and some apps (flashlight and eggtimer for example). ovi store not near the apple or android store but was good enough for my wants.overall, i am pleased with this purchase. the value for money quotient is very high for this device and i am loving it and hope it gets even better in future software updates.",4

"The Nokia N8 is an excellent phone.It will take a couple of hours to figure out everything about how the phone works but once it's set up the phone offers the following features:- Multitasking: Once you set up all the icons, shortcuts and menus in the different customizable screens in the phone, you actually see how each application is working without affecting the phone performance. For example, you may be playing a song (and its application window shows song, controls, etc), then below that window you can have you email that updates as new email comes, in another window you can see your social media updates and activity on real time, etc. and the phone works like that in all applications.- Camera: Excellent picture quality in photos and video (12 M / 720 p)- Full customizable screens, icons, short cuts, menus, etc. No limits!- All 3G and GSM Bands possible- SIM LOCK FREE! This means, that when you travel internationally, you can buy a 'Pay as you go' SIM Card and use the mobile phone locally (also to use wireless data and use Skype or any other application)- Many applications (productivity tools) that Apple and Android would sell you, are free in Nokia OVI- Great battery duration, excellent voice quality and very, very stable- Very productive phone: It gives you many options for any application, for example, it lets you choose what to do and how, for example, if you are going to play your music files, you can choose to transmit that music in FM to your car stereo, etc- HDMI output, so if you load a movie, video, etc. or simply watching videos from the phone, you can connect a HDTV monitor or TV straight from the phone!The only feed back that I have for Nokia is they need to update the Youtube application, of course, Nokia didn't developed it since Symbian is too open and independent developers can upload those applications, but besides that, it is in general terms....BETTER THAN iPhone 4: I have BOTH phones> iPhone 4 with AT&T; and Nokia N8 with T-Mobile....and guess which is more productive? Nokia!BTW: You know who uses my iPhone 4 instead? My kids just to play games...and I don't let them touch my Nokia :)I just hope Nokia won't destroy this freedom on their phone after Windows software comes. If I could get the Nokia N9 instead, it will be much better but I think I will try to but it in Australia in October 2011.",5
THIS IS MY COMPANION. AM NOT ALONE WHEN I HAVE MY NOKIA N8.THIS PHONE IS REALLY AMAZING.I CAN DO WHAT EVER I WANTED TO DO WITH MY NOKIA N8.THE PICTURE AND VIDEO QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME,5
"I have always been a huge Nokia fan but bailed in favor of android devices a while back. I couldn't resist giving the N8 a shot to see what advances Symbian 3 had made. All I can say is it hasn't come very far. When you are used to the blinding speed of advancement in the android space its hard to imagine how Nokia are going to stay relevant.This is amazing piece of hardware, but how frustrating it is to be back on symbian. I dont even know where to start suffice to say that I am back on android after only a few days with N8. I was very disappointed as I had high hopes.N8 Pro:Excellent battery lifeBest camera of any phoneFinally has threaded texting (as long as it took isnt a good sign for Nokia)N8 cons:Not many prosKeyboard sucksBrowser sucksExchange client sucksStill cant type direct in a text boxLimited widgetsLimited appsSluggish UINo wifi tetherSmallish screen for size of deviceAmoled screen isnt even close to vibrantIf maemo and symbian 3 are the best Nokia can offer I would think they would be best off to leave symbian 3 on their feature phones and adopt android for smartphones. Android is a tidal wave they just arent going to be able to stand in front of. Unless you are a huge symbian fan or have apps that only run on symbian then give this one a miss.",3
"The N8 is the perfect phone for me. I travel often and usually take an iPod, small notebook computer and camera with me. Now I have my N8--it does it all! The music player works well and the camera is the best I've seen on a phone; it has great editing tools and it can be used with an HDTV. I can access my email, browse the web and IM family and friends; all from my phone. It switches to WiFi whenever available so you don't have charges from your phone carrier. The manual is well written and easy to follow (I printed a copy and put in a 3-ring binder for easy reference). I had no trouble setting the phone up initially. The free maps, GPS and navigation system are great for traveling all over the world. Because it is an unlocked phone, I can switch SIM cards and change carriers in the USA or get a local country SIM when traveling internationally. The OVI suite is easy to use, allows you to easily update your contacts/calendar, the OVI web site offers great support and many apps to download for free and to purchase, and the OVI Music works seamlessly to make playlists and sync to your phone. There are several private web sites which also offer support and products for the N8. I plan on keeping this phone for a while and I feel it is a great value.",5
"[...]Nokia n8 is simply the best among all my previous phones.(windows mobile, blackbery, sony ericcson, motorola)By using ovi suite 2.2.1.23 (download from internet), outlook contacts, calendar, music, vedio, photo in PC can be simply synchrozied with nokia n8 in two ways.All maps around the world can be downloaded via ovi suite from nokia directly into the phone's 16GB internal memory. I downloaded maps for usa, canada,mexcio,china and hongkong along with street name prompt voice in English(us) and mandarin(china) within 2 hours. no need to bother data plan.I am currently owning Garmin 765, Tomtom 540XL and Megellan 4700. Nokia n8 is the best among them due to its super fast gpu, 16GB flash memory, crisp AMOLED screen at highest resolution (640x360),super loud speaker and multi-touch capacitive screen. (Garmin 765 is slow in rendering and touch input is buggy, Tomtom 540xl tele atlas map is not as presice as navteq for usa, megellan 4700 is poor in rendering vector maps due to its screen resolution and bad bluetooth).The 12 mega pixel buit-in camera surpasses my 10 mega pixels Canon point and shoot camera A1000. Night shot is even better than my 18 mega pixels Canon T2 DSLR. but it takes some time to get used to since looks like it doesn't come with image stablization altough it is supported in vedio recording, user has to slowly and gently press down the camera button to take a picture even after haivng fully focused.Nokia n8 has managed networks nicely, it is fully  customizable for prority to use 3.5G, Edge, wifi. default is wifi, 3.5G then at&t; edge for internet. it allow user to create different network destination and select one as default. main internect apps allow user to choose customized network destionations.Nokia mail supports yahoo, msn, gmail, etc and microsoft exchange server, user can manage all various email accounts in one place and it supports archive folers for yahoo mail. there is a minor bug,  due to its push email feature, it keeps turning on wifi if it is available even when user exits nokia mail application and turns off wifi manually. i believe this minor bug can be fixed easily when nokia are ready to update.another potential problem is that it can not show chinese/japanese/korean due to the location setting of usa and the missing of fonts library. nokia may formally allow user to download and install the east asian fonts. curretly it shows China map in Chienes pingyin. for chinese web pages and contacts it shows rectangular box instead which needs to be fixed as nokia promtotes the conecting of people.fring works fine with n8, it can be downloaded from ovi store right from the phone and it is free, it supports instant messenging (fring, msn,gtalk, yahoo,etc), video call and voip call. no need to bother skype which is not available for nokia n8.the built-in web browser is already very nice to show web pages with multi-touch to zoom, flash to play youtube, java 2.1 to play java game. so I haven't tried the opera 10 or opera mini-browser 5.1.FM radio can be directed to its own loud speaker though it is still required to plug-in the accompanied headset as an antenna. FM radio is super sensitive, can pick weak signal, and sends out better sound than lexus car stereo, sadisk sansa FM radio. super basss is excellent but don't know how to disable it, looks like nokia n8 doesn't have built-in Equalizer application, should be easy to find one over ovi store.as always, nokia n8 is a phone with excellent signal and voice at both ends. rock-solid built. looks and feels noble. can last for at least 4 years.I bought it for my kid's usage during her University study. It serves the purpose very well.",5
"About delivery: excellent, received on time amd in good conditions, I would suggest Nokia to include a case with the phone as with other models that I have purchased before. About the phone, it's the best, size, functions, performance, etc..I'm very satisfied with it.",5
"It has been a while since I wanted a Touchscreen phone and was considering the HTC Desire, the Samsung S8000Jet, Motorola Milestone XT720 and the Nokia N8. The iPhone is a great phone but just not the one of my taste.Why did I choose the N8? well, it has all that I wanted.I am currently outside the US and the 3G frequency here is 850MHz which narrows my options.The HTC: Only specific models has the HSPDA 850MHz (A8182 & A8183) which are quite difficult to find on Amazon, in fact I was not able to find one!The Samsung: Checked with a friend's phone and the signal coverage was not that good.The Motorola: Great phone (xenon flash, HDMI out, HD Video capability), but a bit too big to fit confortably in my handI currently own a Nokia E51 and it is a great phone, in over 2 years no issues at all and the signal coverage is amazing (My wife works at a school out in the mountain area, and where all the other phones(Samsung, LG, Motorola) have failed with the network coverage(screen shows searching for network) this one wins by far (80% signal strenght)Purchased the phone on 'Cyber Monday' for $429. Got the 'Made in china' one and was a bit worried based on the reviews I saw, but I've had no issues at all with the phone(most of our electronic devices are made in China anyway). It even came with the updated firmware(RM596) and all the software updated as well (OVI suite shows 'No updates available')Only some minor annoyances so far:1. Sometimes (less now than before) The screen will not respond to touch. I tap and tap and tap again and nothing, as if it was not aware that I was tapping or maybe I am not doing it correctly.2. Sometimes when I flip the phone, the screen will not rotate, I have to return it to portrait and then flip it and then it will rotate the screen. Amazingly, if the phone is on the table, as soon as I pick it up, the screen rotates!3. The home screen is a bit simple and you cannot place widgets side by side. Solved by installing SPB Mobile Shell4. The browser is not that bright so I use Opera Mobile 10 instead.5. No QWERTY keyboard in Portrait mode (weird as when using Opera, you get the QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode)6. No 'custom' setting for equalizer as my E51 hasBedides these, which I can live with, the phone is working great. I get 100% battery after 1 complete day of usage. Power Saving Mode is nice to cutdown battery dain.Played Angry Birds, Neef For Speed Shift, Real Golf 2011 and Galaxy On Fire and they all ran flawlessly.Now, I can leave my Zen Multimedia Player(N8 Headphones have a great sound) and my Panasonic Lumix Camera at home as I have both features in the N8, plus, I can use it to make and receive calls.",5
"guys, this is a really huge disappointment. don't waste your money and nerves. I regret to say, but I think I am done with Nokia.. Worked well only for two weeks. Then the ovi store stopped working and nothing (tried many ways0 helped). The manufacture... can't really help.",1
"I own N82 - phone I purchased at Amazon as well and have been very happy with. I purchased N8 before Thanksgiving at $429 to be able to access T-Mobile 3G and get better GPS and camera, as well as larger screen and touch interface.I like N8, but I wish I waited with the switch until the firmware upgrade is available.The phone has some issues that are mostly software, not hardware related based on my exchanges with Nokia and reading various forum postings.The most annoying one is this phone's refusal to stop searching for WiFi when requested manually. I've never seen it in any phone I have owned.The second is apparent incompatibility of some of the voice guidance files with the maps. My UK voice guidance works fine, but not US with street names, which is silent. Standard Nokia Tech advice - do hard reset. I wonder why Nokia even bothers employing Tech Support people. After dealing with them for 20 years I find them pretty much useless.The biggest problem that is not software related (I think - Nokia helpers have no clue - do a hard reset they say ?!) is very poor flash performance. My N82 has N8 beaten hands down. At 10ft distance my N82 photo is nice and sharp; the N8 photo is grainy. This despite of supposedly bigger N8 sensor and 12 MP versus 5MP.The HD video though works great, except for low light conditions again, and flash will not work with video.Overall I am sufficiently happy with the purchase to keep it. I'll use my N82 as a backup with other SIM cards when travelling. Again, I wish I waited till they resolve various bugs. I always liked Nokia and it is so dissappointing to see that they cannot get their act together. In Nokia Support forums Nokia reps are missing. This would have been great opportunity for the company to address some of the above mentioned issues. The fact that they are silent speaks volumes to their customer service committment.",3
"I'm very happy with this phone.  I've been a fan of the N-series for a while, having previously owned the N95 and the N96.  The transition to touchscreen has been pleasant and effortless.  I thought I would miss the physical buttons, but I don't.  I have learned how to 'Swype'.  I like that there are so many apps for this phone in the OVI store.  I have all my music loaded onto my phone, so I have plenty to listen to while I'm at work.  The builtin GPS is very good, seems to find a signal much quicker than my previous N-series phones.  Battery life is excellent.  I would recommend this phone.",5
"I've had my N8 a week and I have a genuine love-hate relationship with it already.Technically, there isn't much I can say about the N8 that hasn't already been said.  The cameraphone is incredible 12mp, with easy-to-learn picture, movie and editing options.  The phone gives good service.  But that's where the love affair ends.I've had no luck at all with the supplied Nokia Ovi Browser.  It's awful, suddenly goes non-responsive, interprets pinch-to-zoom as clicking on something my fingers happened to come close to, won't stop, won't go to what I click on (despite the bio-feedback you feel which sort of 'clicks' when you touch a link).  Except for reading the news, it's practically useless.So I downloaded Bolt.  I've had great success with Bolt on other phones.  Unfortunately, there's no 'arrow' feature for the N8, so I'm left with the same non-responsive touch problem as on the Ovi Browser.So I downloaded Opera.  Mini.  Then Mobile.  Same problems with the iffy touchscreen.So I downloaded some cheapo Chinese browser.  It's okay in mobile mode, but as basic as can be.I'm flummoxed, and I guess I'm keeping the phone.  But I can definitely see replacing it next year when the new WM Nokias come out.Too bad.  We could have been a great couple.  :(",3
"My N8 is the last Symbian phone I will ever own, and since I noticed that the reviews for this phone are all over the place I figured I would try to write a balanced review. I have owned lots of Nokia phones (e71, e75, 5800, C6-01, 701), and two Android phones (original Nexus and the Google Nexus Galaxy GSM) so I have a pretty good idea of the difference between Android and Symbian. I've never owned an iPhone, but I do have a new iPad and a touch, so I have a pretty good idea of what iOS5 is like.The main advantages of the N8 is the build quality (I've never seen a company build hardware that's as nicely put together as Nokia) and the incredible flexibility of the phone and operating system. I mean this phone has an FM radio, FM transmitter for use when you rent a car or need to make a quick connection to a car radio that doesn't have Bluetooth or inputs, USB input, hdmi output, and what is without a doubt the best camera in a cell phone until the 808 came out.  Symbian Belle is in many ways more flexible than Android (and certainly more flexible than iOS which forces you to use the wretched iTunes and makes it a pain to import or export anything from it). The phone itself is pentaband so you can use it in almost all of the world where GSM is available. It has 16 gb of memory built in and you can add a microSD card for even more storage - unlike the iPhone or many newer Android phones, and the size is perfect. My newer Nexus has a 4.7 inch screen and feels like a tablet when I hold it to my head.The problem is that as they did with the N97 the self destructive folks at Nokia hobbled this phone with an extremely slow processor and only 256mb of program memory. In spite of the efficiency of Symbian, this lack of hardware guarantees that your phone will run sluggishly (if not when new shortly thereafter as you use it) and that installing any new software (such as the mobile Microsoft Office that was just released) will be a nightmare, requiring you to try to decide what you're going to have to remove to make it fit.  The 701 which I also owned had double the processor speed and program memory and it made the exact same Belle software run much more smoothly and gave you enough program memory to not have to worry about it.  For the life of me, why Nokia would design a phone that originally sold for about $600 and save a few cents by not including the appropriate processor and memory is impossible to understand.  It's not like they hadn't seen what that did to the N97 and the damage it caused to Nokia's reputation, but for some reason as a company Nokia was incapable of listening to any criticism or learning from their mistakes.So, I use my Nokia when I'm in an area where I need navigation but can't get data (Nokia maps has world wide free maps that you can download and use without a data connection, even now Google maps only let's you pre download a very small area), and when I think I will want to take pictures since the camera is good enough to replace a point and shoot camera. Yup, in a word, it's the perfect vacation phone. However, when I need a phone to actually get work done with or want to have access to some of the more popular apps like Netflix or Pandora I use my Nexus. It is a complete shame, because if Nokia had tried even a little bit the n8 could have been a real contender. For a while the popularity of Nokia in India and China allowed them to survive, but now with their switch to Windows 8 and the popularity of Android in those countries it seems like final curtain calls for Nokia.  So, at the current price if you want a good phone to travel with and an example of what could have been, this is a good purchase, but if you are only going to have one phone that you have to use day to day unfortunately even at these fire sale prices you're probably much better off buying the Google Nexus.",4
"After owning a Nokia N900, I find this phone very disappointing.I knew I wasn't going to like not having a physical keyboard, but I found it almost impossible to type on this phone. Some of you may find this as a plus if you forget to lock your phone, but the heat sensitive touch-screen really doesn't work well for me. I find that every other letter I type is missed because I am used to tapping with my fingernails, it allows for more precision. Being forced to use my finger tips, not only am I struggling to hit every character, but every other one I do hit, is the wrong one, because the buttons are too small to use the tips of my fingers.I am also extremely disappointed in the fact that the battery is embeded and therefor not replaceable. I have always found solace in the fact that I can pick up a spare battery for a few dollars if the current one isn't holding a good charge. I also like keeping a spare battery around for every phone I own, in case for some reason the phone dies and I can't find my charger, or similar problems. And just to iterate the importance of being able to change a battery, the last N900 I owned, the charger port quit working, and broke completely lose. It was a pain, but I was still able to use the phone, due to keeping a spare battery and an external battery charger. If something along those lines happened with this N8, that would be impossible.Then there is the fact that they have reverted from the standard micro-usb charger port to the little dinky nokia charger. I used to be okay with that little dinky plug for nokia phones, I kind of liked the fact that a lot of their phones had the same  charger, while other companies had different chargers for almost every phone. However, after having gotten used to the new standard micro-usb charging port that almost every new phone has, I have not been too worried about forgetting my charger. To go back to having to remember to haul a charger around all the time would be quite annoying and unnecessary in my opinion.Overall, I am disappointed with the N8, originally I was willing to step down and accept a phone that I think is lacking some serious technology, because I love Nokia. But, when it comes to reality, look at HTC's phones... Nokia is charging the same price for a single core 1ghz processor while HTC has dual core 1.2ghz processors in their phone. Nokia is also behind in the fact that they don't have a single 4G phone, or an android phone. Nokia has a little more ram, but what use is that if the phone can't handle enough programs to use that ram. And the thing that made the N900 so amazing, is the Maemo operating system. To go back to the Symbian OS, I felt confined. I would take Android over Symbian any day. Now Nokia is going to drop Symbian for the Microsoft Windows Mobile 7 OS? YUCK! The one thing nokia has going for their phones, is the cameras. But once again, lets be real, it's nice to be able to snap a good shot when I'm on the road or something, but any photo I want to come out nice, I pull out my nice camera. The cameras on phones just aren't high enough quality yet to be able to take the same kind of pictures that a stand-alone camera can. A decent phone camera can only go so far, it doesn't make or break the sale in my opinion.As for looks, the phone looks great, the camera looks great, if I was only going for show and not usability, this would be a good phone. But lets be serious, I can't be stuck with a phone that I can hardly use.",2
"Solid device overall, fantastic build quality, camera is a winner - kills all competition hands down, nice responsive screen. Call sound quality is superb. Have high hopes for battery life - played all day over wifi, browsing, youtube, app installs, etc., still more than 50% left (according to the battery indicator anyways), Symbian is usually strong in that department. 3G on all GSM US providers. Nokia-provided VoIP call support is available. Apps are there, marginally lagging behind Android/Iphone. True multitasking. I'm not a big fan of the Symbian menu system but still this phone is a big improvement over S60. I also own a N900 and my only hope that Nokia will combine the best features out of these 2 devices and produces a MeeGo phone in the future, if this ever happens it will be a killer phone.Some complaints:-Limited picture sharing capabilities, but looks like Pixelpipe should fill that gap.-Social networking widget seem to ignore the offline settings for the home screen.-No tightly-integrated Skype as on N900, the Skype-provided app works but no video.-Browser is OK really but not great, websites insist on using their mobile versions w/o option to use the full mode-Screen resolution is lower than that of the competitors-On-screen keyboard is always full-screen, this blocks chat contents-No portrait QWERTY keyboard-Search by voice is broken in Google Maps-Lack of fart apps-More to be discoveredUpdate:Alert! Alert! Alert! If you need to be able to read/write messages in non-latin based languages think twice bebore buying this Phone, at least the US version sold by Amazon as there is no official support for that. It is such a shame that a great device such as n8 has this limitation. No hope to get this working with the upcoming or future s/w update according to Nokia Care. There are limited workarouds such as using third party keyboard apps, using browser to read emails, or hacking the phone and installing customized fonts. Knocking down 1 star because of this (really should be -2 but I realize this may not be an issue for most ppl out there)Update #2:Installed Symbian Belle. Very nice. Brings significant visual and usability improvements, qwerty portrait and split-screen landscape keyboards, most importantly the UI is much smoother and more responsive now, very pleasant to use almost as good as the i-device and newer androids. Apps are still lagging and it won't get any better. Out of the box input language support is still an issue, you're limited to what Nokia thinks you should be using in your region, so if you buy an official US phone but need to write in Cyrillic good luck with that, there are ways around it but in 2012 this should be built-in into the device.",4
"Bought phone to replace N97 which is giving me RAM memory problems. After long doubting wether to go with N8 or iPhone, finally choose for N8 although a little worried about the turning off issue.During set up phone turned off and impossible to turn on again, neither get it into battery charging mode. Very disappointed.Update 19.12.2010 -  Amazon sent me to Nokia and to come back to them if encountering any problems with Nokia. No response from Nokia! Maybe assistance on working days only, so maybe tomorrow?Found on internet additional hard reset besides maintaining power key for 8 seconds: Press menu - camera - volume down keys together. Than try again power key for 8 seconds until phone vibrates. Could get phone to turn on and charge battery. It died several more times, but could get it alive this way again. After several days it seems stable now.As a comment found on internet: it is like buying a new BMW/Mercedes having to ask road assistance to start it!!Update 24.12.2010 - After 4 days it died again being able to start it up again after waiting a few hours doing the same tricks again. Than once more it turned off. Decided to turn it in to go for another brand/model. Amazon customer service has been helpfull, Nokia Care by e-mail is useless, they don't answer.Update 05.01.2011 - Thumb up for Amazon customer service, professional and on time. Nokia Care responded after 9 days, allready returned the phone, sending a standard message that the phone needed a technician and repairs (!!)I answered the e-mail, but no reply. Shame Nokia with this very very poor respond to this global problem (see Nokia internet forums).Update 27.05.2011 - After 5 months Nokia responds to my email indicating that I have to go to another Internet site and send in again my claim!!! Incredible!! They realy don't have a customer service sence!!",1
"Unless you need a great camera phone this one is not a good choice. It's buggy!! Almost none of the apps work smoothly over time. Some apps just stop working and i need to remove/reinstall them. Even music player is buggy, when you delete music it keeps the empty folders unless you do some magical things in private folders and so on, not a user friendly stuff. It has a lot of features but really most of them are not functional. FM transmitter, hdmi out - cool outstanding stuff, do they work? - nope, just sometimes, depending on weather in Finland i guess. FM transmitter sound quality also sucks. Updates take 4ever, i guess because of symbian capabilities... Very sad they dumped meego/maemo, they were much more promising:(I traded mine for SG2+$200 which made this world a better place:) It's not as stylish as n8 but guess what - it works always, independent of weather in South or North Korea!Bottom line: unless you need a great camera and good offline navigation don't go for this phone.",2
"For the 50+ cell phones that I have personally used in the past, hands down Nokia still makes the best quality than the likes of BlackBerry, iPhone, Samsung or other smartphone manufactures.  Symbian had it's leap in the speed, reliability, efficiency, and sustainability in terms of operating system, but it's lacking a powerful eco system, apps, and developers.",3
"EDIT: Today, (Feb 11, 2011) Nokia announced that it is moving to adopt the Windows Phone 7 platform.  That means that it is ditching the MeeGo system almost completely and will plan to phase out support for Symbian in the next year or two.  That isn't quite enough for me to change my review on the phone, because the phone still holds its own as the best hardware on the market right now.  But you'll have to keep in mind that Nokia will slowly stop rolling out updates for Symbian.  If you're still attracted by the hardware, I say still go for it definitely.  Like I state in my review, Symbian^3 is more than adequate, it is just slightly clunkier than it's competitors, but it CAN do everything that other OS's can do.  If you're not particularly in love with the hardware or hardware is less important to you, I would look elsewhere, or at least wait until Nokia starts rolling out the Windows Phone 7 mobile devices.  So this news really shouldn't affect either camp of potential buyers: those buyers that are looking for great hardware (like me), this phone is still a worthy investment; those buyers that are looking for the whole package and would be willing to make hardware sacrifices for a better OS, I would wait until Nokia starts making Windows phones and compare those to Android/iOS.Hardware:+ Very solid construction, the body is made out of solid aluminum and there are no loose parts whatsoever+ The screen is made out of gorilla glass, which is about as close to having a bulletproof glass cellphone screen as you'll ever get.  It's pretty much impossible to scratch this screen, trust me people have tried on youtube and failed.+ Capacitive touch screen with limited multitouch support (see software for further details)+ Amazing camera, as of this moment, this is pretty much indisputably the best camera phone on the market.  Gone are the days of inch thick camera phones that only output 8MP cameras with a much smaller sensor, the N8 takes 12MP photos with a sensor that is larger than many dedicated cameras.  Megapixels hardly tell the whole story, but the sensor size goes a long way to allowing your N8 to replace your dedicated camera.+ Built in xenon flash, the N8 uses a legitimate camera flash and in my anecdotal use, it has the same range of illumination as my point and shoot.  The LED flash on many other phones can't compare to a real xenon flash+ Video is very clear and can record in 720p resolution.  One of the best features of this phone's video capabilities is the fact that when zooming, it uses the fact that it can take up to 12MP frames so that when you zoom in video it maintains 720p resolution and uses more of the camera's capabilities.  For those of you who know how digital zoom works, that means that while digital zoom while taking pictures still is pretty much pointless, the N8 allows you to take full resolution 720p all the way through the zoom levels and isn't just a digital zoom of your original 720p frame.+ Built in FM transmitter means that you can play your music through a radio signal which your car's radio can pick up once you tune to that frequency.  You don't need to mess with adapters or cables.  The signal isn't extremely strong, so your mileage may vary depending on your phone's location relative to the antennae in your car.+ Built in GPS with FREE LIFETIME MAP UPDATES AND VOICE NAVIGATION.  That means essentially for the price, you are getting a built in GPS with your phone, that performs just like a standalone GPS.  You can use the GPS without a data plan with no problem at all, it picks up a signal quickly and is very accurate.  If you're worried about the phone accessing the data network accidentally, you can just turn off A-GPS (the only function that uses data).  The GPS will still work perfectly normal, it will just take slightly longer to pinpoint your position.- Since there is no LED, there is no video light available for the phone and that also means you can't use the phone as a flashlight, unless you use the screen with the application QTorch does nicely.- OVI maps (the GPS software) occasionally does weird routes that are not necessarily the best nor the fastest, but it will always take you to your destination, regardless.Software:+ Three completely personalizable home screens that you can swipe left or right to access.  You can provide a shortcut to any of your apps (including third party ones), put in a list of your favorite contacts in a scrollable bar as a widget, get access to email, music player, etc.+ Gallery is now much improved in that you can 'check' multiple items at once for deletion or to email, instead of deleting one picture at a time, which was a huge problem in S60v5.+ General use is generally snappy in and out of menus.- Essentially what S60v5 should have been, it doesn't make huge changes other than the home screens, it just fixes up some of the bugs in S60 like the inconsistent double/single tap to open applications.- Occasionally phone felt slightly underpowered, but these cases were few and far between- Overall, the user interface (UI) is not as polished as Apple's iOS or Google's Android.  Things aren't always as intuitively placed as you would like.  But in terms of functionality, Symbian^3 can do everything that the above two OS's can do, it just doesn't really make all the features as accessible.Bottom Line:This phone is extremely well built and has pretty much all the hardware options you can ask for in terms of camera, video shooting, build quality/materials, FM transmitter, built in and free GPS.  In terms of software, Nokia's OS lags behind iOS and Android, but it is fully capable, just not as polished.  The main draw for this phone, however, is the fact that it is unlocked.  Which means if you don't need a data plan (more importantly, if you don't feel the need to pay and additional $30 per month), you do not have to get one for this phone.  Nowadays, every carrier will force you to get a data plan for your phone, which in the long run, comes out to be much more than the cost of buying this phone unlocked ($200 for an iPhone 4, plus $30 additional data plan for 24 months comes out to be $920 just for the data plan.  Not to specifically rag on the iPhone 4, just providing an example of buying any smartphone from a carrier).  That was the big draw for me, and then the amazing camera and free GPS were just bonus features.",5
"I got this as a gift to my sister. The best thing is that is small, flips, has a hardware keyboard and it is Android. However, after a couple of years of use it's shows age. It was good while it lasted.",4
if you just want a basic android phone that looks differently then this is the phone.  I liked it but decided to upgrade.  The only thing I did not like is not being able to assigne specific ring tones to specific callers.  Maybe you can figure that out.  but the phone got lots of attention because it is so small and people thought it was cute.  I like cute things that are different.,5
IM ORDERED 5 PHONES FROM BLUTEKUSA AND THEY SEND ME ALL OF THEM WITHOUT THE 2GB MICROSD CARDS THAT HAS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BOX AND THE BOXES WERE DAMAGE LIKE THEY PUT ALL THE PHONES IN BAD WAY INSIDE THE BOXES. WTF WITH THIS SERVICE. I DONT RECOMEND BUYING FROM BLUTEKUSA IF THIS ARE THEIR BEHAVIOR OF DELIVERING PRODUCTS TO ITS COSTUMERS. FIX IT AND ILL CHANGE REVIEW.,1
"Well, It is an excellent product, mainly it is due to the screen (relatively large), very very responsive, Android es very fast and good, Motoblur do the things easy and organized, 'BUT' I cannot turn on 3G, I bought also Nokia C5-03 that runs on the same 3G bands this phone and it works perfect. But this does not happen with the Motorola, which gives me just Edge signal. Maybe because,,, maybe it is not totally unlocked, it is a phone from Orange, with a good 2G, Edge Reception but impossible to turno on the 3G.My Web PAGE (...)",3
"As a phone I'd give it only 3.5 - 4 stars.  As a fashion accessory its a full 5 stars!  This little phone us unique and stands out as different from all the traditional brick style smartphones.  Looks and Cute factor are off the charts, and my daughter loves this phone because its different.  Id have to agree with her (as a fashion guru goes ~ she's 14 and a trend setter in fashion - not so much haute couture, but maybe more like a 'Cindy Lauper' to her classmates ~ and she does start fashion trends amongst her friends....Update:While there are no complaints about the phone, this update is a complaint about the seller....  This phone was listed as UNLOCKED, but when my daughter went to use the phone, she kept getting a request for a SIM UNLOCK CODE.  Turns out the phone was LOCKED to a particular carrier (AT&T;).  Had to pay an additional $10 for an unlock code.  Truly a disappointment on the seller.",4
"This is super cute, but not as user friendly as the Apple and Nokia phones I also use (Apple for my US account and the others as unlocked phones that can take an international SIM when travelling).  Making calls or texting are super easy, but web browsing or apps are very difficult to use due to the tiny screen size.  I still havent been able to figure out how to use most of the features.  It is not terribly user-friendly.This phone appears to be made for a Mexican or South American market.  The instruction booklet was only in Spanish and in one screen when it asked me where I was located the only choices were Mexico and three SA countries.Mine came with dark pink, black, and orange back plates.  It is one of the cutest phones I have had and is perfect for my use, but I wouldn't want to use it as a smart phone.",4
"When I first received this phone I loved it! It was the perfect size and a nice conversation piece! After the novelty wore off there were several things I started to hate about it. First, you cannot update this phone like the other phones that came out around the same time. Secondly, you have to save a picture that is sent via MMS to see it clearly. There are some other pet peeves I have about it but it would take a century to write them out, so the bottom line is that I would not recommend this phone.",1
"As most of people if not everyone else, we got this to replace the cutting edge phone for our 80 years old mother, she loves it. It works as advertised. It would be great for kids first phone as well. It's a bit pricey for this simple phone. The buttons are a bit sticky and recessed too much for reach. Very loud and clear. Good phone!",5
"First of all, this is a simple 'feature' phone, and far removed from a smart phone. Yes, you can text for those times when one might want to (several popular TV talent shows come to mind....) but this is truly a phone to make CALLS, and offer ease of use.I got this for a senior family member who suffers from macular degeneration, and is almost blind. Traditional cell phones ( particularly touch screen) had become hard, if not impossible to use.I looked at several brands, including the better known 'Jitterbug'  and decided to try this- and I am glad I did. Just 5 is a strong brand in Europe, and is making its way to the USA now. The design is simple and clean, almost as though you did buy it in Europe or at IKEA here in the states - quite a nice look!The read-out is bright, black against orange, very easy to see.  I tested this without contacts or glasses, and was able to see it quite clearly.Some of the nice extra's include a LED flashlight (super bright!) and a radio mode (great reception!) that I pre-set to a traffic/weather/news station, which is a nice way to be connected. Ear phones are included, too. This is great to empower people with vision issues - it can be hard to tune a radio, sometimes.As for operation, I like the 'talking' feature that confirms each button you press.  Some may need this, others may not - you can easily turn this feature OFF, if you like.  I tested this with a blindfold, and was able to dial with ease. Yes, there is a 'bump' on the 5 key to help you help you get oriented, a bit.Sound quality was outstanding, be it on speaker phone or traditional use.  Very easy to set up auto-dial numbers, as well.Battery life is almost un-heard of ( to me, anyway) well exceeding the 6 days indicated when on 'stand by'.  Amazing!  Really.What most people will buy this for, is the 'hoped to be never used' SOS feature - a recessed button on the back of the phone. When pushed for a few seconds, it will auto-dial and TEXT a distress message to up to 5 numbers (911 is the default, if you dont enter numbers), which is a HUGE value.This ALONE, is a great peace of mind benefit, somewhat like a life-alert system.  When activated, the phone goes into speaker phone mode,and dials numbers until there is an answer , and keeps re-dialing and texting for an hour. In addition, a VERY LOUD siren sound comes from the phone, which would help EMT's find the person in distress.( do note, this unit would not replace a traditional alert system, as it is NOT waterproof, nor does it connect you to a dedicated rescue service, other than 911, if you program it. It is a GREAT addition to such services, and is far less costly- if you can afford both-great, if not, this is an important option).Lastly, PLEASE set this up FIRST before you give it to someone!  I do wish it was out-of-the-box ready to go, but it is NOT. You may or may not need a GSM sim card ( if you DO, Amazon vendors have them, frequently under $3.00, in cell stores around $25.00).Set up the number, and select your plan - T-Mobile and AT&T; are the GSM firms in the states.  I selected a pay-as-you-go plan with no-contract, .10 a minute plan.  $15 a month will keep you going for 30 days, and $100 is good for a year. That is around 8 bucks and change, which is a good deal.Some Just 5 phones come with a JOLT mobile sim card, which may be worth your consideration, too.  Be sure to check around to see what might offer the best price, and coverage.Seniors and low-vision/blind people are the core audience here, and they like things they CAN do, rather than being reminded of what they CANT do.  Four stars only because I would like more text-to-speech.  Exceptional!  A feel-good/feel-safe gift, as well!",4
"I bought this phone for use by a visually impaired person.  Having large buttons was good, and a voice reads the numbers as you punch them in.  Otherwise, the phone does very little by today's standards--no camera, a speaker that's difficult to access for speakerphone use, very limited ringtones, tiny screen, and of course no internet access.  But I knew this, and just wanted a reliable, basic phone for someone who can't see well.It performed its basic function for about seven months.  Then its ability to pick up signals became very unreliable--no service anywhere, then suddenly service, then no service.  Very frustrating, and ultimately not usable.  Then I discovered the company has no meaningful customer service--no phone number (the one they provide connects to a fax), a 30-day return policy to the the vendor who sold it--typically some fly-by-night operation you'll never get ahold of.  So, after seven months, a useless phone and no recourse.",2
"Finally found a phone easy enough for my Mom to use, sort of. The keys are big enough to put labels on them. I put on/off, answer, and the names of me and my sibs. It's foolproof for her and super easy to set up.Unfortunately, the battery will not hold a charge. I'm hoping to get a replacement. Oh, also, the flashlight feature didn't work. I was going to keep it anyway because I figured my Mom wouldn't be able to figure out how to use it anyway.If the battery had not been defective, I would easily give this 5 stars. I'm thrilled to find an easy phone for my Mom.",2
"I bought this phone for my 72 year old father in law. He has problems with his hands and had problems opening and closing slide and flip phones. The phone worked well with his AT&T; sim card and calls were clear. There was no problem with signal and call quality that is not normal for AT&T; in this area.The only problem with the phone was that it was hard for him to learn how to use it. With the lack of a real display and only a small window for text he had a hard time figuring out how to make calls. It took me a few minutes to figure the phone out and get numbers programmed into it for him also.  The interface is not very intuitive, even for me and I have degrees in IT.Overall the phone is excellent and works well. The user interface could be a little simpler for a better experience for seniors that are not tech savvy.",4
not realistuic with the phone hanging like that Not so happy,1
"It is really good, It is sturdy and doesn't move. The band doesn't absorb sweat like that so it is good as well. I've had it for a while and no complaints.",5
"My wedding is coming up in less than 8 months so I picked up a Tuneband for my iPhone, headphones, and a pair of new balances to get me off my butt and moving.  I've been hitting the treadmill 4 times a week and since my iPhone is my calorie counter, my music player, my GPS, and my phone, it comes with me.Overall, I'm very happy with my Tuneband.  It keeps my iPhone secure, allows access to the touch screen, rests comfortably on my arm, and is relatively easy to adjust.  The weight of the iPhone is considerable compared to the light material of the band, so it took a run or two to get used to the light shift you feel from it as your arms swing and move.  I preferred to leave off the screen cover because I have yet to have a positive experience with one.I get sweat on it sometimes, but I figure it's no worse than when it gets fogged up when I leave it in the bathroom during a shower.  That's why I sprung for a good replacement warranty plan anyway right?",4
Works well for my runs. Great to have for my music and safety and security. I double it over to keep it tight on my small forearm.,5
"I have a large bicep, so it's been hard for me to find a case that fits. I'll be looking no more. Fits my iPhone 4 great, and I can control it through the case just fine. Comfortable on my arm, and seems to resist sweat. Awesome, and cheaper than the other junk you find in stores.",5
"I really like this band.  Has elastic strap, and easily is removed to just be used as a case.  came with screen protector as well.",5
Pliable silicone construction makes it easy to get my phone in and out of the holder.  I have standard guy arms and the band fits fine.  Only thing I wouldn't mind having is making it rainproof.  Suppose I should have looked for that feature to begin with.  Can't fault this product for that.,4
"I just purchased this case about a week and a half ago.  As soon as I got it I tried it on only to find it did not fit comfortably.  So I looked at some of the other reviews and there was an email address for customer support.  I sent an email looking for a way to purchase a larger band that would fit better.  I received an email reply back within the hour and was told the cases come with a standard 15 inch band, but if I needed something larger they had a 19 inch and a 22 inch band.  I let them know the 19 inch band would work and I was very surprised they said they would send it to me at no cost to me!  Here I was, looking to buy a larger band and I am confronted with a company that wants to send it to me for free, and they also answer emails quickly and are very friendly, what the hell!  I am not used to excellent customer service, but I can tell you I surely do like it!  This is a fantastic company and I will recommend them and do business with them again.Ok, back to the case and armband.  The case is rubber and it fits really well over my Iphone 4s.  I have easy access to all the buttons, etc.  I was looking for a sports band to wear while hiking and trailrunning, and then I was prepared to buy a second case for normal everyday use.  The case I was using was given to me by my wife, after she upgraded to a different case.  While I don't mind a hand-me-down, it was a little too slippery for me.  I need a case with more grip.  Turns out this sportsband has a great rubber feel to it, and is now my everyday case too.  When I run, I just attach the armband.  Works great.I took this case with me this morning on a hike on the Appalachian trail with my four boys.  I used the strap, which fit over a light sweatshirt, started my 'Imapmyrun' program and went off hiking.  There were a few spots where I wanted to take pictures and I was pleased to find I could easily loosen and slide the armband off to take pictures, then quickly put it back on and snug it up.This is a very high quality sports armband that fits an Iphone perfectly. The customer support is some of the best I have come across in a long time.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I am not.",5
"I've had several armbands for running and never really been happy until I bought this product.  I've been running with this armband for about a week now.The actual case is a very flexible silicone - I can fit my iPhone in it without removing my regular elago S4 case.  The armband is wider than other ones I've had, so its not as likely to curl up while running.  In my opinion, they can't make the strap too wide, but it looks about as wide as they can get it for this version.I'm a big guy with a big arm and I really have to tighten this strap up to keep the phone slipping during a run.  There is more than enough slack to do so.  Even with it tight, it doesn't cut off the circulation to my arm.  It holds firmly for the entire run.The 'Thank You' card from Grantwood was a nice touch when this case came in the mail.  Great product!",5
just as big as it was sold to be.  I have not used it yet with my phone but it will fit my arm and go high enough I can still do curls!!!,5
"I'm very happy this arm band.  It was inexpensive and it does exactly what it says it does.  Holds my iPhone secure to arm.  It's easy to get the phone in and out before and after running.  It's simple, durable, and inexpensive.",5
"I was disappointed with this, mostly because it won't work with a case on your phone. You must take your case off and put the cheap silicone case over your phone, then put the armband through that one.  Ya, that's how it is designed but too much work.  Not for me.",2
"Went for my first run today with my new Tuneband for iPhone 4.  It fits the sprint iphone 4s perfect.  Those that say it does not fit, I'm betting they are not taking the iphone out of there case.  It slides in easy and holds it secure. The strap velcroed around my arm nice and tight but with give.  I did have a long sleeve shirt on today so I can't comment on how it would feel on the bare skin yet but on the arm with a shirt, it was very comfortable on a 4 mile run.  Easy to get to the controls.  I highly recommend this as of now.  Well see how it wears over a year or two.",5
"My daughter is training for her first half-marathon and couldn't stand silence.  With her music library already on her iphone, it made perfect sense for her to find a way to jog with her music.  So we did the research and found this version from Tuneband.It is VERY IMPORTANT that you purchase the right style for the type of product you are going to use it for.  The headphone plug for the iphone is in a different location than the ipod.  So read carefully before you click and save yourself any return hassles.This silicone skinned model is very comfortable.  The elastic band is adjustable and can easily accommodate different sized arms.  The cover does a great job of holding the iphone in place.  No worries about if flinging off during your jog.  This unit is also open on the front ensuring when you press a button it works.Overall - this has been an excellent purchase and is highly recommended.",5
I love this case for walking/running with my IPhone 4! It's made really well and is comfortable to wear! Great case!,5
"Comfortable, stays in place, easy to change in and out.  Soft on the phone.  Can use doing any activities.  Bought for my GF.",5
I am in love for this one. The best purchase ever.  Great and secure silicone armband with the screen protector.This should be more expensive because of the high quality. wow! I really recommend to everyone. iT IS JUST PERFECT.,5
"GREAT design, this mount allows your iphone4 to breathe, instead of fully enclosing it, and allowing heat and condensation to slowly destroy your electronic device.  It's made of a Comfy, Stretchy fabric, similar to neoprene, and is adjustable.  Very Satisfied...",5
"My first impression of this product I thought the silicone rubber would tear of easily due to its cheap construction. So far a month from usage it's still good as new. With that said, I think if the silicone material was thicker in design it would be much better.",4
"Excellent armband for Iphone 4!!-Perfect dimensions (snug fit)- The right materials, no odor (like Reebok Armband)- Easy to adjust- works great on 16 miles runs, sometimes forget it's even there- No issues with volume up or down buttons- I can change music, or apps without removing from arm- Easy to clean/wash- great solution to avoid having your iphone swinging in your pocket",5
"But I think im going to look for something sturdier. After so much use, it starts to roll down my arm and get loose. It ruins my entire jog since I'll have to carry my phone and I HATE carrying things while jogging",4
"I just tried this item today on a 10-mile run with my iPhone4s.  It holds the phone securely, including the case that the phone is in, with very minor slippage from my tricep toward my elbow during the run.  I was wearing long sleeves, so the chafing reported by some other users was not an issue.  I wouldn't use it in the rain, but for decent weather (even in the upper 20s like today in CT) it does the job.",4
Somehow you can take your phone in and out of this case over and over and it never loses its form and ability to hold the phone perfectly.,5
"Fits perfectly, easy to use, very comfotable unlike others that restrict blood flow around your arm. Cheap and high quality material.",5
"This is the only iPhone4 armband I've tried...It's top-notch. I use this for running and have had it for several months now. The phone easily goes in and out of the case, it sits securely inside, and the entire thing sits very comfortably on my arm. It seems to be very durable and it is still very much in one piece. I've recommended this armband several time to other runners.",5
I bought this for my weekend mountain hikes. Works extremely well and after a year still looks like new so I'm passing it on to my wife and buying one for my iPhone 5.,5
"This is a great armband.  The strap is nice and wide and offers good support for the iphone.  The phone cover is great, too.  It offers good protect for the phone.",5
"If you love to run, listen to music, and track your running, you need to buy this armband! Running with your phone in your pocket is a pain and it stays in place. With this arm band, your phone will stay in the same place and be comfortable. In case the armband falls off your hand, it is great protection with a case and a screen protector on it. I recommend this product to people who like to run and listen to music at the same time.",5
It is a tune band for Iphone. Too bad I sold my iphone right after I got this. At least it will make a good gift for my father's birthday!,5
"I bought this to use with my iphone 4s while running, its comfortable and the bad is just big enough to fit on my upper arm. Only problem is that my phone gets really wet with sweat, no moisture protection at all.",4
"This armband works fine, though, as some others have stated, I am average sized and the strap was a bit big. I could always adjust it to fit, but it had to be in just the right place.After a few months, I stopped using it and boughtNathan Shadow Pak Runners Pack (Black)instead. My phone case is snug and it was such a pain to take my phone out and put it back on every time I wanted to run. The pack allows me to keep the case on, and throw in my keys and I.D. so its easier and safer if something were to happen. I also find it easier to pull the phone out to adjust the music or whatever if needed, but that may be personal preference. I didn't like fumbling with the armband to make adjustments.",3
"After trying a few other types, its quite clear this is the best armband I've used so far.  It works for running or lifting.Pros: the elastic band holds snugly if you are running.  When you are lifting, some arm bands are restrictive or pop off as your arm flexes.  It has holes for headphones and the camera.  Feels sturdy.  I've had it for a month and its still in mint condition.  I bought a 2nd one - one for my gym bag, one for running at home.Cons: There is not any protection on the screen, so I get nervous running with this thing in the rain.  I usually wear a short sleeved shirt that can cover it up a bit and keep rain off it and out the holes.  But so far so good.  Also, I can put this thing in without removing from the case, but its not the best feeling fit.  For example, I wouldn't put this thing into the arm band with the case on if I was about to go running.  And I have a thinner case.  If you have a heavy duty case, such as an Otterbox, you will certainly need to remove the phone from it before putting it into this arm band.  My case takes all of 2 seconds to remove.  I believe the Otterboxes are a few minutes.  But take that into consideration if you have one of the more heavy duty drop proof cases.",5
"I typically hate any kind of arm band even if it is just for a iPod nano. So when I ordered this for my iPhone 4, I already had my mind set that I would just be returning it due to a lack of comfort and generally slipping down my arm. Imagine my surprise when I received it, put my phone in it and went for a run. Amazingly comfortable for an arm band and no slipping at all even with the iPhone in it. The simplistic approach is what really works. I have just a back case on my phone and it fit perfectly. It is easy to put the phone in and take it out and there is not a worry that it will come out.Well done.Update: I just cannot say enough good things about this band. I guess I am just so used to having an armband be uncomfortable or having to strap it so tight so it won't slip. Yes, you do have to be gentle with the holder but that is common sense. I assure anyone wondering that your phone will not come out of this at all. Not fancy, but just works!!! And no....I do not work for Grantwood and have never heard of them before buying this strap LOL",5
"The case fits my Sprint Iphone 4s perfect. Seems pretty protective, not the best, but pretty decent. The screen protector is okay, I didn't really use it to be honest, I use a different kind that I bought separately. As for the armband, this is what is great about the product. It's designed to fit any size arm, it is easily adjustable. The only problem I had was that it kind of irritated my arm, but I believe that is only because I'm not used to it.",4
"***EDIT*** My below review is slightly misleading, I don't mean to say that it isn't a well made product. It works well and serves it purpose.I bought this as a present for my mother. She was really excited. Before I gave it to her I wanted to see how well it worked. It serves it purpose, but it isn't the highest quality item ever made. It comes in a plastic bag, which isn't a problem, but is an indicator of the cost and quality you're getting. For how much it costs and the fact that It holds an iPhone 4 or 3GS just fine, which is what I needed, I'm not complaining. I only give it 3 stars because I can't give it 3 1/2",3
Perfect for the everyday runner!  Ran with this during the Peachtree Road Race 10K in ATL last weekend & it was great!  Have been using it for 2 months now & I am very happy with my purchase!,5
"This is a very solid and secure armband.  It holds the iPhone in place and allows easy access to the almost all the controls.  The one minor complaint I have is that the volume buttons on the iPhone are covered by this case.  It's not a big problem, but it's a curious design decision.",4
"So compared with the vast majority of other armbands that I've had (for both iPhone and non-iPhone alike), I've gotta say that I'm liking this armband the most of the bunch so far.Pros- The armband is removable, so you can use the rubber case as a standalone case for the iPhone 4 if you're so inclined.- Inserting the iPhone into the rubber case is a breeze: You just slide it in through the open screen area.- Screen and rear panel protector overlays are included in the event that you don't already have them.- The screen is exposed, meaning that you don't have to press through some ridiculously thick sheet of rubberized plastic to get at the controls.Cons- The screen is exposed.  Yeah, it's a pro, but in the event it's raining?  Quickly becomes a con.  Not entirely sure how the con part of this could be removed, but it's indeed a valid concern.- Given the serious ease with inserting the iPhone, I'm concerned with how easy it might be able to slip out during a run?  I'll update the review after a run or two with my findings.OverallIt's a great armband/case combo, and I don't know of any that I'd recommend over it at this point in time.Update 10/25/10:- Went out for a run with it, and I'm very impressed.  Still cautious about the screen being exposed in the event that it rains, mists, etc., but that aside, it seems to hold the iPhone in place very well.  Still highly recommended!",5
"Are you active? Do you run, workout, play sports or do anything that requires the use of your hands free of having to hold or pocket your hundreds of dollar phone? Then this is your item.I have rather large biceps and love to workout using my arms in multiple ways, shapes, directions and forms. Put this puppy up high on your bicep and forget that you have your iPhone on you while you workout, while you run, while you do anything.I really can't say enough about this. It's easy to wash, and for the value, you have to be crazy not to pick it up. My Tuneband has been through some rigorous workouts and I've gotta say it still looks and performs like new.5 Active Stars out of 5!",5
i have 17 inch arms and this one actually fit me i was pretty surprised...it broke within the first month of using it but i just returned it and ordered a new one....hopefully i just got a defective one,5
"This is my 3rd arm band for either an iPhone or iPod touch, and is by far the best one I've used.  The arm strap is elastic, which means you don't have to cut off the circulation in your arm like some other arm bands.  I also like that the silicone case.  Though it's not a perfect fit, it's 98% there.  But there is no fear the phone will fall out.  I also like that the case detaches from the arm band if you want to use it all the time.  But if you want to use a separate case, it's easy to remove and pub back in.My last arm band ripped after less than 1 week of use.  This case looks as good as new after the first week of use.  The silicone where the band threads through is thicker, providing extra strength in the only area that really needs it - a very good design idea!",5
"This is a pretty good band considering the weight of the iPhone it holds.  My wife and I use it to run with the phones and listen to our music.  It takes a few times to get the tension on the strap so that it does not cut off circulation and also keeps the iPhone from bouncing around on your arm.  If the tension on the strap is not enough, then it allows some play in the movement of the case surrounding the phone.  I have tried a few others on the market and think that this is the best for the price.",3
Best carrier by far. Easy access in and out and very comfortable.,5
"I recently got the new iPhone 4S and scoured the Internet looking for the ideal armband for it. After reading various reviews on different products I decided to try the Tuneband and I'm very glad I got it. It fits really well, is very comfortable, and secures the iPhone firmly in place. As another reviewer pointed out, it isn't the most attractive looking thing but it's for exercise anyway so I think that's a non-issue. What matters is that it does what it's supposed to do and do it very well. Highly recommended.",5
"I am an average sized male and I think this product is great.Ergonomics: It is very comfortable while running, or while lifting weights.Functionality: The product holds the phone very securely, and I am not worried at all that it will fall out during a workout.  It provides easy access to the screen and all buttons while also being fairly easy to get in and out of the armband.The only downside to this armband is that if you keep your phone in a case, you need to take if out of the case before you can put it into the armband.",5
"Dropped my phone while this case was on it, no harm done. The only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that. The customer service of Grantwood is phenomenal! I guess I had lost some weight so the band was too big so they have a one time replacement on the bands and make sure you get the right size. Highly Recommended.",5
Excellent product that provides dual purpose. Silicon case is tacky and fits well. Band stays on arm and does not slip down. Great buy!,5
"At the beginning it was tight. The only problem was all the photos with flash were pink. Then my wife started to get it off everytime she had to take a picture, and now the case is loosen and it is even over the camera lens. It is a design problem, the manufacturer needs to let more space for camera and flash. THe good point is that it protects the iPhone, and it is good for running.",3
"I bought this for my wife, and she has some trouble with getting the band tight enough to stay put.  It is easy to use and fits the iPhone 4 great.  She really likes it.  Now that the weather is getting cold, it works better for her with her coat on.  Good item at a good price.",4
"I like this band because my iPhone sits well in the holder. It feels secure, which was one of the most important things I was looking for. I like the fact that there is not a plastic screen on the front as sometimes I need to access my phone. The volume buttons are also easy to use, which I like.What I don't like is that the velcro sometimes rubs against my arm when I'm running. It's not extremely bothersome, but I notice it sometimes. I can usually re-position it while I'm running though and then it doesn't bother me.I have used this to run over 30 miles already and it's been a great armband. I recommend this for any runner or walker out there that wants a quality armband for a decent price.",4
"Love the color and the fit.  Although it does not protect from rain, it holds the phone nice and secure.",5
I didn't perform a drop test on my company but I bet that it could absorb a 4' drop with no problem.  The case is very large but offered the protection that I was looking for.  It's actually a case over a case. The clip also has a lock to prevent accidental drops.,4
"It was great for protection, but if you have to remove the case for any reason (resetting phone), be careful, the claw on the outer shell broke and was unable to attach to phone properly.",3
"I'm writing this review to help any buyers who need to make the decision on Otterbox Defender vs Seido Rugged.  I purchased the Otterbox Defender case a month ago. The Defender case is good but has faults.  I wrote a review on Amazon about the Defender case if you need to read in depth my reasoning for replacing it with the Seido case.The Seido is ALOT better than the Defender case. The case comes in 3 parts. An inside plastic shell which snaps together PERFECTLY unlike the Defender case that squeaks whenever you press a button.  The second set of protection is the silicone cover. The third is another hard plastic partial cover which provides extra protection to the impact zones of the phone.  This piece is very important. My Otterbox's inside case chipped at the top left corner from a fall...with the Seido Case this would not happen because it has the extra protection at the corners. The seido case also leaves no openings except for the speaker and mic holes.  Seido leaves the option to use your own screen protector.  The Otterbox forces you to use its built in screen protector.  The biggest plus of the Seido case is the holster.  The case fits my wide police duty belt perfectly, something the Otterbox could not do.  Great case, just upset that i spent money on the Otterbox first.UPDATE: After a month, the holster release latch broke off while i was taking the phone from the holster....not so durable for a 'RUGGED' case/holster.  Sigh...took one star off.",4
"I ordered the Rugged because I work construction and my phones take a beating. But I really only need two things, some sort of protection if/when I drop it and a holster that is easy to get my phone in and out of with some sort of positive feedback that it's locked in place.  I picked the Rugged because, well it was rugged, had a camera cover and the holster looked like it would secure the phone but be easy to insert/release the phone.It is definitely rugged, the case itself is made up of a sandwich of a hard plastic interior case (the Innocase Surface), silicon middle case and then a spider like exterior cover that mostly protects the back and corners.  This sandwich like design seems like a reasonable method of dissipating the energy from a fall.  I happen to like the bulk created by the case, it makes it easier to hold for me, but be warned that the combined bezel created by the layers is really thick, and I am unable to get to the edges of the screen (I am completely unable to move icons between screens with this cover on).  What's really mind boggling is that given the additional bulk from this case, it's not designed to work with the extended battery.  (I think the mixed reports of it actually working has to do with the fact that there are two different versions of the Verizon extended battery ~1800mah and ~1930mah but I honestly don't know)The camera cover is just a flap of the silicon portion of the middle case, it's not a sliding plastic door like I thought the picture shows.  This is a big problem in my opinion and one of the reasons that this case will have to be returned.  The silicon flap when closed rests against the camera lens window itself.  This means that any dirt or abrasive material that gets in there will scratch the camera window, the exact thing I'm trying to avoid.The holster itself is sturdy, has a ratchet style turning belt clip and definitely holds the entire assembled case firmly.  The only problem is that the design of the spring loaded retention is shaped in a way that when putting the phone into the holster on your hip, there is a very likely chance that the clip will hit the screen first, not the bezel.  This is the deal breaker for me, I'm not going to subject the screen of the phone to repeated strikes from the case that is supposed to protect it.If you're the kind of person who is disciplined enough to place the phone in the holster perfectly every time, then this isn't a problem for you.  But to be quite honest, I smash my phone into the holster constantly all day long, making sure I have perfect technique is not my primary concern.Also worth mentioning; as someone else pointed out, the location for the directions is just bizarre.  The directions are split into two papers, one sits inside the case where the phone itself goes, if you're careful you can remove it without completely tearing it, then the second piece of paper is actually sandwiched between the inner case and the silicon case (IIRC).  Very odd choice of packing directions considering the large blister pack the whole thing comes in.Normally my reviews are not this negative, I guess I'm frustrated.  All I really need is a holster that's as simple as the one for my blackberry.  In all it's not a bad case, but it's not the case for me, I'm going to have to keep looking.",3
This has to be the best case for your Droid X if you need rugged protection.  I use the holster and carry on my belt so the face in protection is a must and I love the flaps that cover and protect all the ports and camera.  I have never dropped my phone but I am certain that this case would protect it to the fullest if I ever did!  The only complaint I can even think of would be that the holster belt clip isn't adjustable...meaning it fits up to a 2' 'duty' belt so on my regular 1.5' belt it has room to move up and down; but it really isn't a big deal at all.You will absolutely not go wrong with this case if ultimate protection is what you need!!,5
"The Item was more than I expected.  It appears to be very durable.  I believe the case is of a very good design.It has two cases. You first install an outer shell which works good on its own.  Then there is a silicone glove that goes over the shell providing a very durable cover.  In addition there is a outer plastic corner protector that helps protect the covers and keeps the silicone glove secure.  The sylone protect the buttons and camera lens.Very nice concept.The reason for the three stars is the belt clip.  I cary a book bag.  The second week of usage I had an incomming call, I removed my phone to anwer the call when I arrived to the car an remove my book bad the bag caught on the belt clip and broke it.  I do not know the answer but I would suggest protecting the belt clip when the phone is not in its holder.  I also noticed this clip tends to get caught on my seat belt.I believe the case will do an excellent job protecting the phone just be careful with the belt clip, especially if the phone is not in it.I have an old Motorola belt clip that works with the hard plasic inner shell of this case.  I plan to see if the belt clip can be purchased seperately.  I work in a steel mill and the environment is very harsh.",3
"I originally purchased the Otterbox Defender and was happy with it for awhile. (2 mos.) The outer silicone casing streched out on me leaving it sloppy where it covers the buttons on the bottom. I wasn't too fond of the buttons being covered in the first place. Ok, that I dealt with. Next the built in screen protector on the Otterbox seperated from the top inner snap-on cover. Ok, enough is enough! I ordered the Seidio Convert and couldn't be happier. The outer silicone case cover is held on by a plastic/nylon? exo-skeleton shell which holds the silicone in place perfectly and I'm happy that my four bottom buttons aren't covered. Problem solved. I do give credit to Otterbox because when I called their warranty number, they are sending out a brand new whole case assembly priority shipping as soon as they get more in stock. In conclusion I would have to say it's a user's preference as to which style and the Otterbox is less expensive.",5
"I've been using this case and holster for about a month and I'm very pleased with it.Yes, it definitely makes the phone look very large, but I kinda like that and it's a big phone to begin with.I always use it with the rugged skin and holster so can't comment on the innocase but I did have to pull the battery on it a few days ago and it was a pain in the butt to undress all the layers from it.I don't think it's realistic to think it will protect the phone from shocks of being dropped, nor will any case for that matter, but I'm confident it will keep the phone from getting scratched and I dropped it in mushy snow last week and having the multiple layers protected the phone from moisture intrusion.Here's what I don't like...The camera lens cover is definitely a must have, but this little flap is difficult to open and it doesn't want to stay plugged in to the little slot, resulting in the rubber flap photobombing its fair share of pictures.The port and jack flaps are a must have too but I can see all rubber flaps breaking off after some time but especially the camera lens flap.They can improve the belt clip by simply terminating it at 270 degrees. This one gets stuck on your underwear  or pans or belt when you try to pull it off. By looping it around like two way radio belt clips, this would not be a problem.I do find that dirt, lint and pet hair sticks to the rubber and felt. But better that than get inside the phone.One of the reviewers complained that you have to carefully put it back in the case so as not to smash the display. I was concerned about this but I haven't found that to be a problem because if you miss, the holser touches the speaker area. In my view, you'd have to be really careless or uncoordinated to accidently smash the top of the holser into the display.I would definitely recommend this and buy another. This is the best rugged case and holster I have seen.",4
Good and small but just feels cheap.  It doesn't provide a whole lot of protection for the phone. The clip and the case break pretty easily but Sedio replaces them for free.,3
"If you have lost or damaged your charger like me, this is the perfect replacement.  I bought this and hoped it fit my phone and it did.  It also, ironically enough works as a great charger for the Ipad 4 keyboard.  I tried it as a fluke as I was getting ready to order a charger for my keyboard.  Not anymore!  Please buy this and save yourself some major money!",5
"Received this item in a resonable time, product itself is fine charges the phone and does exactly what it is supposed to. The price was outstanding for this OEM product.",5
"The cord is so short. I was very u.satisfied with this product. I couldnt even put it from the socket to my table tghat is right beside it. However, i did get my money back",1
"This lasted about the same time as all the other charging cords on the market. They are plain cheap, but we all need them.",4
"It arrived on time and in new condition. It is a replacement for my original that quite working. I wish it had a red light on top of the plug-in piece, but, I can live without it.",4
Bought a few of these because my family lost their's. It works as it should. I need five more words to submit this.,4
"Ok, so if you are looking for a reliable, unactivated Simple Mobile SIM card, then this is what you want. I can't speak for Simple Mobile's service, because I haven't yet used it...and they really don't like answering questions about their service...so I may never use them, but this is a great deal for a SIM that normally costs 8-10 bucks.",5
Bought it for a friend to activate her new phone. A lot cheaper buying it online than paying $15 for a sim card in store.,5
"I researched the Simple Mobile service, so I knew what I was buying.Ordered on Amazon very late Sunday nite.CWR Enterprises of Las Vegas promptly mailed it first class on Monday morning the 5th of December.Envelope arrived Los Angeles noon of the 7th (Wednesday).If this item is what you want, I couldn't recommend a better vendor. :)",5
"One the first day of the new month my data was disconnected. There is no problem with my phone as it works fine with another sim card, in fact, when I put my sim in another phone that phone gets no data. I have called them 5 times in the last 5 days and they keep giving me the runaround checking the phone APN settings rebooting and asking me to wait 24 hours. I have been as patient as possible, giving them a chance to resolve the issue but it's been 5 days and no results. Their network is not providing me data, forwarding me to a T-mobile error page. Maybe this is a T-Mobile scheme to get people to switch directly to them (Simple mobile uses the T-Mobile network)I told the supervisor last time that I just wanted to get a refund since it hasn't worked from the start of the month. She said that because I purchased through a retailer they cannot issue a refund. I said fine refund me for a prior month when I paid on the credit card. She said they don't have the CC information, I said yes you do, because when I paid, it asked me for the last 4 digits only. Then she said it was a prior month so they couldn't refund me for that. They have an endless dictionary of excuses!One look at the list of complaints online (BBB, Ripoff Report, etc.) and you will see why they don't care.",1
"I bought this sim card for $0.40 which I thought was a steal. Activation is pretty simple, just activate the sim card via the link on their website and pick a plan you wish to use. Pay the plan, and insert the sim card into your phone. You should have service within 15 minutes of activation. Great little prepaid sim card for people that wish to pay less per month for their service!",5
"I couldn't be happier I mean the price was so incredibly cheap 70 cents compared to 12$ at simple mobiles website. The Sim card worked perfectly no flaws, had no trouble when I activated it.",5
"Local dealer were charging $35 to $45 for the SIM & B$ Activation fee (air time is extra). So I was shocked to see this activated SIM card for less then a $1. Ordered Saturday and got it by Tuesday.Contacted SM customer support five times to activate and transfer my number since each Rep would mention I was missing something after taking time giving them all my information (first two calls), also the SM system was being upgraded at the time.Things to have before calling SM to activate:1.- IF TRANSFERRING NUMBER- Make sure you have the account number and pin code from the provider you are leaving, in my case T-Mobile.2.- SM SIM CARD- You will need the 20 digit serial number from this card.3.- AIR TIME- Purchase a SM air time card online or from a gas station. You will receive a PIN number that customer svc will need. SM website has a list of local dealers in your area.4.- UNLOCKED GSM PHONE- Customer svc will request the ESN or IMEI (serial number) from the phone you are planning on using. If your phone is not unlocked there is a free tool on the Google Play store called 'Galaxy_S Unlock' that works with several Samsung Galaxy phones (to unlock other phones check on Craigslist).5.- Call SM customer svc and have patience.",4
"DO NOT be suckered in by the advertised 'unlimited data' $60 plan. If you exceed 2GB of usage, they throttle your data speed to a trickle and then cut you off completely. And when you call customer no-service to complain, they give you a Simple Mobile Corporate # in Irvine, CA to call, which is a voicemail that will never call you back.  You are effectively stuck with the lower $40 plan even though you've paid $60 for the remainder of the month. After that, you are forever limited to the $40 plan and not allowed back on the $60 'unlimited data'.I had left several voicemail messages to the corporate meatheads to no avail.  A total scam!",1
"I thought this was to good to be true, this simple mobile sim card was true, and just what I need it. I would recommend this to every one it's just that simple and great service.",5
Very easy to activate by your self.  100 % work for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and 3 models  (unlocked/world phone).Highly recommend.,5
What the world needs is an unlimited-time SIM card. I use my cell phone about one minute a month - if that.  I need a SIM card to activate my smart phone.  (I will be using Viber for all but emergency calls.),5
"Just sim caards but they work in my fone, so no problems at all.You have to be King Kong to open the little packs they come in,but right is right.",5
It's cheap and easy to activate. Only issue with simple reception in some areas especially in the basement. U can cut either to micro or nano sim. I am using this sim in iPhone 5,4
yes im a very happy customer i have a cell phone again all thanks to you with your fast service,4
"As others say nothing to say about a Sim card.however, the product came as described, Sim+Activation number. and it came fast.0.47 USD is the price i get that sim which is amazing comparing to its official price on the site 12 USD!!the service of the company itself is another issue.. it is not that great, but at least you have a USA phone without a contract starting 40USD a month.internet speed is very poor. but again, i am reviewing the product which is mentioned here 'simcard' not the Simple Mobile company service.",5
"I use this on my unlocked iPhone 5.  I cut down this SIM to &#34;nano size&#34; using a basic nano SIM cutter, and now I have a very inexpensive service working on an awesome handset.",5
"I can't believe I had simple mobile for almost 3 years,  the service is great I get reception in every area all the time.  I been through 3 phones already lol couldn't have done that if I was on contract! Currently I have HTC Sensation, $40 plan as long as I can remember unlimited talk and text and Web.  Honestly Web is very slow but they got new plan out of $50 a month with 4G. I have used 4G in the past and it's really quick on par with T-Mobile since they use same service towers I guess.Now some things I don't like are : the way you pay for the plan is somewhat confusing gotta pay through online the website is not intuitive! But manageable.Customer service has improved a lot in past 3 years,  I mean really better now but service is still TERRIBLE! that said I had never really had a need to call.Only thing is you need to buy your own phone.  My recommendations is get a used phone of ebay or craigslist,  don't be cheap get something nice the service is on par of tmobile or att so hopefully this helps.Some good phones are htc sensation,  Samsung galaxy s2 and so on.  Make sure you get tmobile branded devices they don't need to be unlocked!!! OR Unlocked Phone. (2 years ago)today galaxy s iii can be purchased fairly cheaply especially with a new release of galaxy s4.",5
"I signed up for Simple Mobile because they advertise a $40 unlimited talk, text, and 'up to 3G' web plan.  After I signed up and paid for one month, I learned that they throttle their data on that plan to 119 kbs.  3G data typically runs between 500 kb/s and 3 gb/s.  2G data, on the other hand, can go up to 150 kb/s.  So, their 'up to 3G data' is actually a 2G data plan!When I called their corporate HQ, they admitted that they throttle data, but claimed that 119 kb/s is at the 'low end of 3G.'  When I asked for a refund, they refused.  I ultimately disputed the charges on my credit card and received a full refund.My advice:  Don't trust Simple Mobile.Update:  Since this review was first published, Simple Mobile was acquired by American Movil, which also operates Tracfone Wireless, Net10, and Straight Talk Wireless.  They've since changed their policies very slightly.  The $40 plan is now throttled to 230 kb/s.",1
"I put the SIM in my unlocked phone, but it never found a network.  I assume it doesn't have coverage where I live.  It can be a little spotty here, but H2O wireless worked right away.",1
Compared to getting it from simple mobile this was a steal and they work excellent ill buy again if i need more,5
Arrived much quicker than advertised - about 2 days.  Easy activation.  Love the service.  I'd recommend this to everyone.  I'm using the $40 unltd plan with $10 international.  What's not to like?,5
"I got the Sim card on sooner than I was spect it. I love it and will recomended to any one who are thinking to change to Simple Mobil company. Is easy, fast, and is the right price. Thanks.  Recibi el Sim Card mas rapido de lo que esperaba. Se lo recomiendo a aquellos que deseen cambiarse para Simple Mobile. Es facil, rapido y se ahorra mucho. Graias.",5
"They make it sound as if your getting something for nothing. Ever hear that before. there is a charge for starting the service and then you pay and find that your data no mater what plan you get is always throttled back.I wouldnt waist time, If you like cheep go with parent company, That would be TMobile",3
This is a pretty good deal when compared to 12.99$ for sim on Simple Mobile site..  activated it and it works just fine,5
"I bought a Simple Mobile SIM card to use in my own phone. The SM rep assured me that there was 3G coverage in my area (determined by ZIP code). There apparently was no way to test the SIM card's reception short of a full  activation, which required paying an initial month's fee. Despite my misgivings, I went for the bait. Bad move. NO service, either at home or at work. Spotty '2G' service in between. I do not know where the company's coverage data comes from, but it's wildly inaccurate. I have since found out that Simple Mobile uses exclusively T-mobile's towers, so check your coverage with T-mobile to get a (hopefully) more accurate idea of actual coverage.",1
"I had a hard time figuring out how to activate. When I put this in phones, it says Simple Mobile in top bar on my webos phone. On iPhone and and Windows phone, it just says No Service.  It could be the phone, but I had no idea if there was coverage or not. I could not get a easy link from their website. The website is good if you buy everything there, but for a SIM card already purchased from Amazon activation process was not clear. I googled and found a link within their site and went ahead and activated for a plan.Once things are setup, coverage was good for me. I just wish it was easy to get things setup and get going. Hence giving 4 stars. Otherwise deserves a 5 star. Hopefully they fix the process easy. It will be good if they have a iPhone/android/windows phone/webOS that works on WiFi and set things automatically on phone.",4
"Great product it is affordable priced just right, easy to setup and I get great coverage in the state of Oklahoma.",4
"bought this regular-size SIM card for SIMPLE Mobile from amazon third-party marketplace seller 'Battery Juice' for under a buck plus shipping & handling. received the SIM card in about four days. got the SIM card for my iPhone 4 and therefore had to cut it down to the size of a microSIM card using asim card cutter. had to first unlock my AT&T; iPhone (see Factory Unlock for Iphone 4/4s/5 here on amazon for five bucks) to get the iPhone to work on SIMPLE Mobile which is a MVNO using Tmobile as the underlying cellular network. then went to the mysimplemobile website, activated the sim, got the $40 service for unlimited voice, text, data, and it works. (to get cellular internet to work, first while your iPhone is on wifi, go to the unlockit co nz website to set up an APN profile for SIMPLE Mobile on the iPhone.) 3G that is compatible with iPhone is starting to show up in San Diego, but if Tmobile hasn't transitioned its towers in your neighborhood yet, then you may only get 2G with the 'E' in the top status bar if you have an iPhone. to get some sort of idea if iphone-compatible 3G is in your area at all, go see the map of 'sightings of t-mobile 3G' on the website at airportal dot de. if you have an android phone, then you shouldn't have these current iPhone issues which should hopefully be all cleared up sometime in 2013 since Tmobile will soon be selling iPhones. but if you have an iPhone and want Tmobile, yet want something more than the $30 Tmobile plan that has only 100 minutes voice although unlimited txts and unlimited data, then SIMPLE Mobile with unlimited voice, text, and data for $40 is worth the cost. (note: the 'unlimited' data is said to actually have a cap of two gigabytes, and therefore you may NOT want to do any tethering or anything that requires a constant connection which are against the SIMPLE Mobile terms & conditions; so, 'unlimited' data for internet seems to mean unlimited access but not unlimited bandwidth.) of course, you first have to get a nice cheap SIM card to use SIMPLE Mobile. that's where the cheap purchase of this SIM card for a buck (plus S&H;) is very much worth the cost.",5
"Tried to activate this SIM, and during activation, the Simple Mobile website said I had to call a customer service representative.I called customer service, and they said that as of 2 days ago (March 10th, 2012), they changed their service and the only way you can activate a new plan is  to purchase a SIM directly from Simple Mobile along with a plan. There is no way to make a bare SIM card work, even if you try to prepay for a plan with a credit card at the time of activation.Don't purchase this SIM unless you already have a PIN, and even then I'm not sure you can activate it if the SIM was not purchased from Simple Mobile.",1
"I switched my service from Tmobile to Simple Mobile last year. But, Lost my last phone as well. So, I got myself an iphone, and my new sim card from here, for like a dollar. as opposed to  $20 at the simple mobile location.  Well, Unlimited talk, text and web for $40 a month is not a bad deal. Especially since they also use the same towers as Tmobile! :-DThank you!!!",5
This is not a MicroSIM. It is a regular SIM card. Please don't market it as MicroSIM card. MicroSIM cards are much smaller than what you have.,3
"I have SimpleMobile $50 Unlimited, but when they say 'Unlimited' its not true unlimited.For some reason they said I used up to much data and they shut off my data for a month.When I called and asked the SimpleMobile rep why they cut me off and they said I was in the top 1% of data usage.Then the lady was telling me I was using the phone as a mobile hotspot or watching movies.I told her I don't use it as a mobile hotspot or do movies and if she had looked over my past year of service I have never been cut off and as far as I know never hit any cap. The only data I use is text and doing automatic photo uploads to my dropbox and photobucket accounts.After telling her this she kept trying to tell me I was using it as a mobile hotspot.I even told her I don't use it as a mobile hotspot and if I needed one I would just goto Walmart and get one for $40.99% of my data use I use my home WiFi.The rep didn't want to hear it.So be careful their 'Unlimited' is not unlimited.",2
Good price,5
Got it in the mail and followed instructions to get it working. Had no issues getting the phone working with this new sim.,4
Cheap!,1
"When I got this piece of crap, I put it on my phone, and it was peeling. Not too cool.",2
"This case is extremely vibrant and fit my phone well! I really enjoy swapping out cases, so if you are a case changer, you will benefit from the low prices and vibrant colors!",5
purchased as a gift. she loved it. period. no more words. why is there a limit? this is stupid. ugh.,5
I like this case but dont love it. Its not glossy its just matte and scratched kind of easy.  I still use it. I love cheetah so it will do. Not very protective though its a litle thin. I had no problem with the seller,4
"This phone case, while it was incredibly cheap, was made quite poorly. The leopard print pattern scratched off in some spots within the first day of having the case on my phone. Would not recommend this.",2
Since is a cheap product the item takes a few weeks to get to your destination (20 days in my case) other than that the case is just what you expect specially for the price.,4
The only thing I don't like is the paint wore off about a month right in the front of the phone.,3
My daughter loves this case. It fits perfectly and the colors are exactly as shown. The design has not chipped or peeled off like some other hard cases.,5
Product is exactly as advertised..... hot pink and black leopard print hard plastic iphone 4 case.  Fits perfectly.  Shipment was a bit slow.,4
"I like animal print and I would reccomend this case. It's pretty, however it's a hard case so you have to be careful with it. Also, it can be a bit hard to remove the case from your phone. Other than that, I would reccomend this product.",4
It's super cute and it protcts my phone enough. It arrived on time and I didn't have any problems! .,5
"Case is very pretty but very matte. No shine at all. Also, this phone case did not last a week without the clips breaking. Luckily I had purchased another from the same vendor that was awesome and fit well, very shiny and was almost difficult to take off verus this one which would fall off.",2
very nice and cute iphone case.... i love it and i recommend it because is very sexy. it came in on time,5
"This case is fine for the price, but it does not snap on one side.  wish it had a screen too.",3
"This was so worth the money I spent on it. It fits my phone snuggly and looks pretty. Unlike others, I haven't had any problems taking it off.",5
Its really nice and looks super cute on my iPhone. the price was great for what you got! I would order again!,4
The mold isn't correct it looks like a piece is missing on the bottom of one side but my daughter like the print and how the case looks on iPhone,4
I couldnt take it off. Which is always a good thing.would buy another if I find one worth it. :),5
if you drop your phone this hard case opens in half nd your phone is all exposed .. the cheetah design starts to chip off but its cute .. just be gentle,3
I really like this case i love the print and the colors :) and its easy to take off if i wanna change it to another case,5
"I like it, It looks pretty. But the print is coming off. I don't think it will last more than two months.......",2
"I got this and within a few days in bringing this new case out on my iPhone in public, everyone DIED...I realized the item is well described, but the item itself is to die for when you see the real thing. It also gives out a cool 3D effect when placed under dim conditions and is pretty soft to the touch. Love this case!",5
I have 2 if these cases . One is where the paint is literally coming off the case & after one day I emailed them saying I would like another . So they sent me another & that had a clear plastic over it which is peeling off . Horrible ! Both of my cases looks terrible .,2
used to the point of no return and held up through many drops on cement and tile etc.. not a bad purchase,4
I just received this case tonight and it was greater than I thought. It covers the whole phone so that's an plus for me. I would recommend this case for someone looking to buy it :-),5
This case is definitely cute but it only lasted like a week and all the black started to chip off. Totally disappointing.,2
"the case is definitely not worth more than $2, its a very cute print but the plastic is cheap as well as the plastic leopard design - it is able to peel right off or get scratched off",3
"Love this case. Its really cute and got lots of compliments on it. It did fade kinda fast, but for the price I can buy several.",5
"Super cute! I know! But after only one, yes ONE, day of light use, the whole back began to peel in various places. Would NOT recommend nor buy another.",1
"Super cute! Two pieces! Provides minimal protection like any other snap on. But this one is so cute, would look best on a black iPhone.",5
Loved that this case was easy to take off and put on. It's very fashionable and affordable. Got here pretty fast as well.,5
This case does no protection at all it cracked my phone after having it for 4 days. Do not buy unless you want to crack your phone.,1
I love this case so much. I wish I could exchange it for a case for my S3 as I haven missed having a cute phone.,5
This is very cute.  I bought it for my daughter because it is necessary to match your phone case to your outfit!  :)  She loves it.,5
"It was purchased as a gift. It was supposed to be hot pink but was red. Didn't snap on very good either. All in all, it was junk.",1
"I'm not sure you can &#34;love&#34; a product but I AM totally satisfied with the price, quality and timeliness of shipment.",5
"I loved my case and got it pretty quick. Surprised on how long is lasted considering the price and cases go for 20+, I would buy again!",5
Super cute item no problems with shipping received it in a timely Manner I am actually in the process of blinging it out added rhinestones and 3d items to the back to make it look different,5
"ORDERED THIS FOR MY NEICE. IT COMES WITH 2 PIECES, FRONT FRAME THAT ATTAHCES TO BACK PIECE. ITS A HARD PLASTIC MATERIAL, KINDA CHEAPY. THE 1ST TIME WE TRIED TO TAKE IT OFF THE PHONE, A PIECE BROKE OFF! LOL..OK FOR THE PRICE..",3
As it was cheap. it looked cheap. Used it for 1 day. and the tape that covers the case is not on right. sorry no bueno,1
I wanted something fun and girly for my phone. And this was exactly what I was looking for. I have gotten many compliments!,5
When I received this case in the mail I was surprised that it was a matte texture. My friend has the exact same case and hers is a glossy-type texture. However I love the matte texture! This case is super protective! I dropped my phone hard against the concrete and my phone an the case was protected! I highly recommend this case to anyone who likes leopard and wants a protective case :),4
Its cute but paint peels off in show white spots easily and quickly case comes in two parts handle with care,2
The pink leopard print started rubbing off on the first day and now it is just patches of white everywhere. I am not pleased with this product,1
"For the price of these snap-on cases, my daughter can change the look of her phone depending on her mood, she loves them.",4
Loved the colors and pattern on this however it doesn't stay. It starts peeling very easily when it's gets nicked. It doens't stay on very well either.,3
The design was already rubbing off when I got it out of the packaging after it was shipped. Very cheaply made. I also do not like the there is a front piece that snaps to the back piece. It is not one piece. I didn't even use it because it wouldn't have protected my phone and it would have just kept peeling the paint off. It wasn't worth to send back because it was so cheap.,1
"I purchase this product for the most stylish person I know, and she loved it! The picture does not do the product justice. I mean, it looks better in person. It's cool for the person who likes to change frequently.",4
This case isn't even worth the few bucks I spent on it. It arrived cracked and the paint was chipped. Don't waste your money,2
"This festive case certainly does not have the prestige as theAriza Imperial iPhone 4 / 4S -Leaux Comfort Case with Genuine Leather -Gold / Black.  There is indeed a style behind the case, but it just doesn't do anything for your phone. That being said, the case still works wonder as it does protect your phone. If you are not expecting much, then you should be satisfied with this phone.",3
"I bought this case because I'm a big print freak especially leopard print, and it was my favorite color, so that made it even better. I was really excited to get this case, and when I got it I put it on my phone right away. I took it off two days later because the print was chipping and it was turning white. It's not noticeable at all, but I'm super picky. I put it on my phone again a couple days ago, and I still have it on my phone as I'm typing. I doubt it protects the phone, but I got it because of how it looks. The reason I gave this three stars only is because it doesn't protect the phone, and because it started chipping. I got tons of compliments on it though, and even though it chipped a bit I'm still using it because when I point it out to people they say they didn't even notice that and that it's still cute and it still looks good.(:",3
"Yes it fit, but no it did not stay on, It seemed like whenever I put it into my purse the case would un snap and come off. the color of it is really strong and pretty",2
"Hard case, two pieces top and bottom snap together, fits perfectly. Color was a little different form picture. less neon. Which is what i expected. Still a pretty case. Overall a goof purchase. =)",4
"I love the color and feel of this phone case (it does not feel like hard smooth plastic but has almost a leathery feel to it). However after a month or two my phone had trouble actually staying in the case because one of the side clips broke off. But you gotta remember for such a low price, it really lasted pretty long! I would recommend this to someone who likes to switch up the look of their phone a lot!",4
"I was expecting something better. The case they show does not look like the case I got, very disappointed !",2
"Good rubber coating cover that boarder the edged of the phone, but not good for sever protection if dropped. Looks very cool, though! Also, hole in the rear for the camera function.  Does not hinder charger connection as well.",4
I bought this as a gift for my boss! He loved it and wanted 2 more!!! its realllly cute (:,5
I hate silicone cases normally but this was a gameboy case so I made an exception and I got SOOO many compliments on this case. I love it.,5
Its a rubber case and its really good. Fits nice and snug. Looks like the real Gameboy ha ha ha,5
This is one of the best screen protectors in the Amazon market.It is so nice on touch does not have mirror images so you can use your phone anytime anywhere if it is suny or cloudy it works just perfect.,5
"I think the 'fancy' install website is a bit much, but I had no problems getting my screen cover installed. I used a credit card to scoot the air bubbles over to the side (and away). I've had the cover on for about 3-4 days and have had no bubbles reappear nor have I noticed any scratches - something I DID have with the last screen covers I bought.While I don't need the back protectors, since I bought a case, I think it's still a good deal for the three screen protectors.I would definitely buy these again if/when I go through the ones they sent me.UPDATE (06/2013): I'm a bit confused about the 'lifetime warranty' part, as I just realized I've bought these before. So, maybe I need to investigate that a bit. Nevertheless, I *DID* buy this again. I have almost no problems getting the protector on (just takes a little patience). But, it looks great on my iPhone 4s.Thanks! :)",5
"This screen protector is decent enough.  It's not the best, but there are certainly worse products out there.I installed this product with no air bubbles.  The biggest culprit of bubbles are dust/small particles.  So, I cleaned off the top of the dining table, used a plastic serving tray as a work-area (washed with soap and water, dried with a microfiber cloth, and blasted with an air can), washed my hands with soap and water (dried with microfiber towel), used nitrile exam gloves, and wore a mask and bandana.  I pretty much scrubbed up, which is somewhat overkill... but it worked.I cleaned the phone surface with my microfiber cloth slightly damp with a mild glass cleaner, wiped the surface again with another dry microfiber cloth, and then used the microfiber cloth included in the package to do a final wipe-down of the phone.  Again, overkill, but it seemed to work for me.I started with the back film first, just so that I can get a feel of the procedure.  After proper alignment with the camera and the edges, I just let the film adhere to the phone... presto!  There were some edges that did not stick, which I gently assisted using the microfiber cloth.  Because I am also using an i-Blason case for the phone, it did not matter if it had bubbles on the back, but I was at least confident that I can apply it perfectly.Next, I worked on the front of the phone.  Same procedure... same perfect result.I used the spare films to protect my wife's iPhone 4S.  I had to 'waste' one pair because I made the mistake of lifting the film from the surface to try to get rid of a small bubble and then re-applied.  Guess what happened... more air bubbles (from dust particles being sucked under the film by the vacuum created lifting the film).  So I used the last pair from the first pack (I still had another pack unopened, just in case).  Single application worked the best.I do not see any rainbow effect on either phone.There are only two negative things I found with this item.1.  Smudges.  As reported by many other reviewers, this film will show the smudges more than if there was no film.  I don't mind this as much, since a little wiping will clean the smudges off.2.  A bit 'thin' and so I am not as confident with the protection as, for example, using a Zagg InvisibleShield.  Unfortunately, the newer Zagg InvisibleShields have recently been more prone to having the rainbow effect than these Halo films.What saves the Halo films are the price (relatively cheaper) and you get three pairs to work with (in case you get bubbles).  Hopefully others will follow suite and provide not just one pair (so you won't be SOL if you get a bubble during application).Overall, highly recommended.",4
"So I'm one of those people that will debate over what to buy for MONTHS (even stupid things like screen protectors for my iPhone). If you're one of these people that isn't sure which one to buy and isn't looking for an extraordinary screen protector, just stop your search and get this one. It's quite good, can't even tell it's there, haven't seen a scratch yet (had it for 6 months, and throw my phone around everywhere). The cut outs are perfect, it's relatively easy to apply, and it comes with 6 (3 front and 3 back). I've never tried the back ones b/c I already have a phone case but I'm sure they're great too. The only thing I don't like is that it bubbles ever so slightly when I put my cell phone case over it. It's really not noticeable enough to squabble about (and I'm really OCD), so it's practically a non-issue.They're great not mind-blowingly awesome or anything, but they're normal reliable screen protectors for a great price. Can't beat that!",4
"No harder to put on phone than another. Had stood up pretty good so far, and my husband is pretty destructive... great delivery time, as usual!",5
"Works well. I used 1 protector for almost a year. I did get a tiny nick in it so I took it off and put on another one, but I'll probably get a new phone before I use all these up. They work very well and I was not disappointed. And I should note that I am NOT careful with my phones. I have gone through 3 or 4 cases since August 2012 (which is when I bought these) and the screen protector has outlasted the cases. I would buy these again.",5
"This really is a great product, my own inability to install it without dust under the screen cover , but otherwise very good product, and great seller.",4
"It feels good, no glare, and I have not noticed any visual loss.  Perfect!  Actually, I have the non-glare now in my iPad 2 and my iMac too.",5
"Did I get your attention? Good. Keep reading...I've been through several screen protectors trying to find one I like the most. I've tried matte finish, anti-glare, even one that claimed to turn my screen into a mirror while my phone was turned off! Needless to say, THAT was a huge disaster.So it was with hesitation that I tried this Halo film. However, the instructions were quite clear and I really appreciated the tip to USE SCOTCH TAPE since that's what saved me a HUGE headache! I love the multiple layers and once I smoothed out the very few remaining bubbles I removed the last sheet to see a perfectly smooth glass-like finish on my phone. I almost couldn't believe it so I waited after a week of use before writing my review. I am STILL quite impressed and relieved to have found a product that keeps my screen pristine while not compromising the retina display that I paid extra to have.For the awesome price and extraordinary quality, I will definitely recommend this item to my friends and family!",5
I had my screen cover on for about three months.. works great!! can't beat the price either..:-) the shipment is great came in a day after I ordered.,5
"Great value and quality.  I was able to put on the film with no bubbles on the first try.I used power support anti-glare film on my 3GS and 3G, but I always was worried that the matte finish would have some effect on the incredible pixel density on the iPhone 4 screen.  After using this film, I have decided that, although it does have a minor effect on screen sharpness, the feel of the matte finish is worth the trade-off for me.  It gives a very smooth feel when using gestures and, as a bonus, leaves a lot less fingerprints than most films.Also of note, I was able to place the film on without covering the front camera, as another reviewer had claimed was a problem.  While it does require somewhat precise placement, once you get it right in my opinion a precise cut film improves the look as well as the protection.  As with all such films, it takes patience and a little experience to get it right, but the cut of this film is actually on par with the more expensive brands.  It does not hang over edges, nor does it impede the home button.",4
I got a very bad quality iphone 4 commuter with that screen protectors and it dissapointed me so i guess these screen protectors gonna be the same quality so im not even wanna them i just need a refund for the whole pkg plz !! Or to buy another something with the money that was a waste of money and time searching for cheap things like those commuter and screenprotectors AND EVEN AFTER A BAD FEEDBACK AND COMMENT LIKE THAT THEY're NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING GOOD THEY'rE JUST IGNORING YOU YOU GUYS DON't buy this product you'll get your worst screen protectors plus when you try to get another or refund they'll ignore you as if you didn't buy anything from them,1
"This screen protector is great and not too expensive either. Very clear, not even noticeable that it's on. Easy to put on too. With some patience I got it on without any bubbles. Overall great product.",5
I've searched around and tried several different protectors. These are of very good quality and easy to put on. Been on for quite sometime now and no scratches at all. Very pleased.,5
"This screen protector is one of the best I have used.  It is a very exact fit, so it is important to get it lined up accurately.  I installed my first one on my iPhone 4S, then received my slide-on case, which was a little tight and caused the screen protector to curl -- not the screen protectors fault! I used a second protector and made sure to line it up exactly.  Using the credit card to smooth as you go works wonders.  My slide-on case went on without a problem, and my screen is clear and bubble-free.  I have no rainbow effect or other issues.  Just a note -- I did not remove the original plastic screen cover that came with the phone until I had these in my possession -- so my screen has never seen dust or fingerprints.",5
"Used them on my 4s and modified them to work for my kids Ipods.  Just got my Iphone 5, ordered the Iphone 5 version of these yesterday.",5
just Matte finish screen savers.  just what you'd expect. sticks on your screen to protect it from scratches and scuffs.,4
"I have used several different brands of of screen protector film on various iDevices, and the Halo films are by far the best.  Installation of ANY film can be tricky, as you need to make sure that the screen surface is perfectly clean and dust-free, but the precision cut of the Halo film ensures that you get the best fit possible.  Any reviewer who is complaining about bubbles under the film simply did not follow the installation instructions - this is due to dust, not a product defect.Two tips for installing/using Halo films on an iPhone:- Install the back film first.  This allows you to practice your technique on a less visible part of you phone.  Any bubbles or mistakes are not as big of an an issue as with the display side.- Use an iPhone bumper case.  The cut of the Halo film is precise enough that the bumper case will hold down the edge of the film, preventing it from being pried up and dust getting under it.  I have had the film on my iPhone for 8 months now, and it still looks perfect.",5
"I really prefer the matte finish on my phone. It doesn't show smears and dust nearly as much. True, the phone is not as shiny, but they don't call it MATTE for nothing! These screen covers are excellent. They are also so much easier to apply than the glossy ones. Bubbles are easy to see and the two layer application allows you to apply on perfectly! I am super happy with my purchase!",5
These are very good quality screen protectors that install relatively easy (always a challenge to get any screen saver aligned just right.  When aligned right it leaves a slight area along the edges so my case doesn't cause it to come loose although this may vary with different cases.  If you like the glossy look this is an excellent choice.  I have decided that I prefer the matte finish to reduce glare.,4
"These work pretty good for the iphone 4.  They are not great, but based a very good value for the money",4
"I like these protectors! I did have a little bit of trouble the first time I put mine on - I had to tear one off and throw it away right away because it got particle under it and I couldn't handle that! But it is great that it comes with four, because you can't beat that price! I have had mine on for around a month now and have had no problems. I recommend these!",5
"helps keep the phone clear and from any scratches. works as describes and shipment was fast. overall, great item to have to protect your phone.",5
pretty good. a little too thin for my liking. the feel is good. fit- maybe a little too big. i definitely like having the back side protector.,4
Worked perfectly for my iPhone 4s. No complaints whatsoever. Hardest part is putting it on. Buy this product now I tell you!,5
"It does what it says it will do. My phone is well protected and hey, I got a few of them so I probably wont have to buy any more by the time I sell my phone off when the contract is over. Awesome.",5
"it is actually very thin and it does not scratch easily, as all of them, place it on the phone is not easy job",5
"These screen protectors fit my iPhone 4S very well.  They are quite easy to install, and you get three for the same price that you would usually get one.  If you mess up on the first one, you still have back-ups.The included instructions work well, and you can watch a video demo online on the manufacturer's website (Halo-Directdotcom).I would add to the manufacturer's instructions:After you clean the screen thoroughly, use a strip of packing tape (not regular scotch tape) to go over the surface (touch and remove on the whole thing).  There is almost ALWAYS dust remaining, even after you use canned air, and the tape will remove the last of it.  Then proceed with the application of the cover.The seller delivered the product quickly and in a sturdy container.  Highly recommended!",5
You get what you pay for.It is VERY difficult to get the film off of this protector without bending it or getting dust or finger prints on it.The material is not very clear optically.The material doesn't stick well to the screen and leaves lots of bubbles.,1
"I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their iPhone.No one ever intends to scrat h their screen,but accidents always happen when you don't expect them.",5
"These screen protectors are truly PREMIUM quality high end protectors at a giveaway price. They arrive in three layers.First layer is removed to adhere it onto your screen. After it is positioned and retained on, you remove the OUTER front surface protector and it is done. Works great, precision made. The last phone I had I purchased four of these. I had the phone for 2 years and never had to change over to another one. You will be happy with these.",5
One of the best screen protector I've ever bought! Last ten times longer than the ones you buy at radio shack or best buy. Recommend this to anyone who has a iPhone,5
"I received this in the mail, and first off 2 of the 3 protectors already had several bubbles in them right out of the package.  The 3rd had a crease in the top left corner.  Also one of the films still had the plastic puchout tab where your ear piece goes which caused some installation issues as well.  I liked the fact they sent an email with video instructions on how to apply the product (reason I gave them two stars instead of one), which I followed.  Since the product already had bubbles in it, it really did not change anything when I applied it to my phone, so 2 of the 3 films went to the trash after attempting to smooth the bubbles out.  The third, I applied and looks great, except for the large bubble in the top left corner where that crease was.  I fully understand how there can be manufacturing issues to where 1 out x00,000 items are defective. but to received 3 of 3 defective items is a very poor defect ratio.  From my experience and other people's reviews it is very obvious to me there are manufacturing issues with this product.  You are taking a chance with your $6 on whether you are one of the lucky ones or not.  I'm currently using the third film until I can get something else in.  I also did not like the grainy feel of the product, nor do I like how it dulls the screen.",2
"I gave this as a gift and they really like this screen protector. The only problem was after a day, it had a bubble that I cant remove. After trying to remove the bubble for a day, we just used one of the extra screen protectors. Overall i would recommend this screen protector to family and friends too.",5
It is a typical protector film.Hard to get on without any bubbles underneath (as are all protector films). No complaints.,5
"Just what I needed for my daughters phone. These are sooooo much better than the regular phone screen covers. The others make it hard to scroll on the phone, these make it smooth.",5
"This screen protector is clear and effective in protecting the screen against scratches. Simple to put, simple to remove with no trace.",4
It is not 100% perfect for Iphone 4.The camera cut (front) does not fit perfectly on the device.They announced the wrong model.I will not buy more.,1
This is no Zaggt cover but it works and does the job and protects the phone. it is cheap and so it is worth it if you want to place on a kids phone and for your phone. Not a bad buy.,5
Good product that does what it should. Generous for the money. I didn't think about covering the back of my 4s iPhone until i received front and back protectors from Halo.,5
"These are some of the best screen covers ever. At this point, I will always recommend.  My screen has almost NO oil from fingerprints. WONDERFUL!",5
"I followed the instructions and achieved a perfect application of this screen protector to my iPhone 4. Once applied, you can barely tell it is there. After 8 months of use, I have not had to re-apply a new one.",5
I have bought a few of these and recommended it to a few people. Excellent quality and you can't beat the pricing!,5
This was refered to me by a family member. Halo is a reliable brand and the warrentyis great. I do recommend this product and the seller for prompt delivery. Good job Amazon as usual.,5
Strongly recommend everyone to use a clear protective screen even if you are just an occasional user of your smart phone.,5
fits fine. i wish i could leave a more simple review but it has to be so many words there,4
Very nice protection for the phone.  Easy to apply.  No issues. I would buy them again.  Good deal.  I recommend them.,4
"Fits pretty well, just your standard screen protector. They last a while but if you have it in an otter box it seems to get pitted quickly with dirt and dust that gets captured between the otterbox screen protector and this. Can't complain about the price though! If you're looking for something better just get a skinomi or zagg.",3
